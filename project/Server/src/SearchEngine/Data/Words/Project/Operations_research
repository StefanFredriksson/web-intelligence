Operations research For the academic journal see Operations Research Operations research British English operational research OR is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions 1 Further the term operational analysis is used in the British and some British Commonwealth military as an intrinsic part of capability development management and assurance In particular operational analysis forms part of the Combined Operational Effectiveness and Investment Appraisals which support British defense capability acquisition decisionmaking It is often considered to be a subfield of applied mathematics 2 The terms management science and decision science are sometimes used as synonyms 3 Employing techniques from other mathematical sciences such as mathematical modeling statistical analysis and mathematical optimization operations research arrives at optimal or nearoptimal solutions to complex decisionmaking problems Because of its emphasis on humantechnology interaction and because of its focus on practical applications operations research has overlap with other disciplines notably industrial engineering and operations management and draws on psychology and organization science Operations research is often concerned with determining the extreme values of some realworld objective the maximum of profit performance or yield or minimum of loss risk or cost Originating in military efforts before World War II its techniques have grown to concern problems in a variety of industries 4 Contents 1 Overview 2 History 21

development and the use of a wide range of problemsolving techniques and methods applied in the pursuit of improved decisionmaking and efficiency such as simulation mathematical optimization queueing theory and other stochasticprocess models Markov decision processes econometric methods data envelopment analysis neural networks expert systems decision analysis and the analytic hierarchy process 5 Nearly all of these techniques involve the construction of mathematical models that attempt to describe the system Because of the computational and statistical nature of most of these fields OR also has strong ties to computer science and analytics Operational researchers faced with a new problem must determine which of these techniques are most appropriate given the nature of the system the goals for improvement and constraints on time and computing power The major subdisciplines in modern operational research as identified by the journal Operations Research 6 are Computing and information technologies Financial engineering Manufacturing service sciences and supply chain management Policy modeling and public sector work Revenue management Simulation Stochastic models Transportation History edit In the decades after the two world wars the tools of operations research were more widely applied to problems in business industry and society Since that time operational research has expanded into a field widely used in industries ranging from petrochemicals to airlines finance logistics and government moving to a focus on the development of mathematical models that can be used to analyse and optimize complex systems and has become an area of active academic and industrial research 4 Historical origins edit In the 17th century mathematicians like Christiaan Huygens 16291695 and Blaise Pascal problem of points tried to solve problems involving complex decisions with probability Others in the 18th and 19th centuries solved these types of problems with combinatorics Charles Babbage s research into the cost of transportation and sorting of mail led to Englands universal Penny Post in 1840 and to studies into the dynamical behaviour of railway vehicles in defence of the GWR s broad gauge 7 Beginning in the 20th century study of inventory management could be considered by whom the origin of modern operations research with economic order quantity developed by Ford W Harris in 1913 Operational research may original research have originated in the efforts of military planners during World War I convoy theory and Lanchesters laws Percy Bridgman brought operational research to bear on problems in physics in the 1920s and would later attempt to extend these to the social sciences 8 Modern operational research originated at the Bawdsey Research Station in the UK in 1937 as the result of an initiative of the stations superintendent A P Rowe citation needed Rowe conceived the idea as a means to analyse and improve the working of the UKs earlywarning radar system codenamed Chain Home CH Initially Rowe analysed the operating of the radar equipment and its communication networks expanding later to include the operating personnels behaviour This revealed unappreciated limitations of the CH network and allowed remedial action to be taken 9 Scientists in the United Kingdom including Patrick Blackett later Lord Blackett OM PRS Cecil Gordon Solly Zuckerman later Baron Zuckerman OM KCB FRS C H Waddington Owen WansbroughJones Frank Yates Jacob Bronowski and Freeman Dyson and in the United States George Dantzig looked for ways to make better decisions in such areas as logistics and training schedules Second World War edit The modern field of operational research arose during World War II dubious discuss In the World War II era operational research was defined as a scientific method of providing executive departments with a quantitative basis for decisions regarding the operations under their control 10 Other names for it included operational analysis UK Ministry of Defence from 1962 11 and quantitative management 12 During the Second World War close to 1000 men and women in Britain were engaged in operational research About 200 operational research scientists worked for the British Army 13 Patrick Blackett worked for several different organizations during the war Early in the war while working for the Royal Aircraft Establishment RAE he set up a team known as the Circus which helped to reduce the number of antiaircraft artillery rounds needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft from an average of over 20000 at the start of the Battle of Britain to 4000 in 1941 14 A Liberator in standard RAF greendark earthblack night bomber finish as originally used by Coastal Command In 1941 Blackett moved from the RAE to the Navy after first working with RAF Coastal Command in 1941 and then early in 1942 to the Admiralty 15 Blacketts team at Coastal Commands Operational Research Section CCORS included two future Nobel prize winners and many other people who went on to be preeminent in their fields 16 They undertook a number of crucial analyses that aided the war effort Britain introduced the convoy system to reduce shipping losses but while the principle of using warships to accompany merchant ships was generally accepted it was unclear whether it was better for convoys to be small or large Convoys travel at the speed of the slowest member so small convoys can travel faster It was also argued that small convoys would be harder for German Uboats to detect On the other hand large convoys could deploy more warships against an attacker Blacketts staff showed that the losses suffered by convoys depended largely on the number of escort vessels present rather than the size of the convoy Their conclusion was that a few large convoys are more defensible than many small ones 17 While performing an analysis of the methods used by RAF Coastal Command to hunt and destroy submarines one of the analysts asked what colour the aircraft were As most of them were from Bomber Command they were painted black for nighttime operations At the suggestion of CCORS a test was run to see if that was the best colour to camouflage the aircraft for daytime operations in the grey North Atlantic skies Tests showed that aircraft painted white were on average not spotted until they were 20 closer than those painted black This change indicated that 30 more submarines would be attacked and sunk for the same number of sightings 18 As a result of these findings Coastal Command changed their aircraft to using white undersurfaces Other work by the CCORS indicated that on average if the trigger depth of aerialdelivered depth charges DCs were changed from 100 feet to 25 feet the kill ratios would go up The reason was that if a Uboat saw an aircraft only shortly before it arrived over the target then at 100 feet the charges would do no damage because the Uboat wouldnt have had time to descend as far as 100 feet and if it saw the aircraft a long way from the target it had time to alter course under water so the chances of it being within the 20foot kill zone of the charges was small It was more efficient to attack those submarines close to the surface when the targets locations were better known than to attempt their destruction at greater depths when their positions could only be guessed Before the change of settings from 100 feet to 25 feet 1 of submerged Uboats were sunk and 14 damaged After the change 7 were sunk and 11 damaged if submarines were caught on the surface but had time to submerge just before being attacked the numbers rose to 11 sunk and 15 damaged Blackett observed there can be few cases where such a great operational gain had been obtained by such a small and simple change of tactics 19 Map of Kammhuber Line Bomber Commands Operational Research Section BCORS analyzed a report of a survey carried out by RAF Bomber Command citation needed For the survey Bomber Command inspected all bombers returning from bombing raids over Germany over a particular period All damage inflicted by German air defences was noted and the recommendation was given that armour be added in the most heavily damaged areas This recommendation was not adopted because the fact that the aircraft were able to return with these areas damaged indicated the areas were not vital and adding armour to nonvital areas where damage is acceptable reduces aircraft performance Their suggestion to remove some of the crew so that an aircraft loss would result in fewer personnel losses was also rejected by RAF command Blacketts team made the logical recommendation that the armour be placed in the areas which were completely untouched by damage in the bombers which returned They reasoned that the survey was biased since it only included aircraft that returned to Britain The areas untouched in returning aircraft were probably vital areas which if hit would result in the loss of the aircraft 20 This story has been disputed 21 with a similar damage assessment study completed in the US by the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University 22 the result of work done by Abraham Wald 23 When Germany organized its air defences into the Kammhuber Line it was realized by the British that if the RAF bombers were to fly in a bomber stream they could overwhelm the night fighters who flew in individual cells directed to their targets by ground controllers It was then a matter of calculating the statistical loss from collisions against the statistical loss from night fighters to calculate how close the bombers should fly to minimize RAF losses 24 The exchange rate ratio of output to input was a characteristic feature of operational research By comparing the number of flying hours put in by Allied aircraft to the number of Uboat sightings in a given area it was possible to redistribute aircraft to more productive patrol areas Comparison of exchange rates established effectiveness ratios useful in planning The ratio of 60 mines laid per ship sunk was common to several campaigns German mines in British ports British mines on German routes and United States mines in Japanese routes 25 Operational research doubled the ontarget bomb rate of B29s bombing Japan from the Marianas Islands by increasing the training ratio from 4 to 10 percent of flying hours revealed that wolfpacks of three United States submarines were the most effective number to enable all members of the pack to engage targets discovered on their individual patrol stations revealed that glossy enamel paint was more effective camouflage for night fighters than traditional dull camouflage paint finish and a smooth paint finish increased airspeed by reducing skin friction 25 On land the operational research sections of the Army Operational Research Group AORG of the Ministry of Supply MoS were landed in Normandy in 1944 and they followed British forces in the advance across Europe They analyzed among other topics the effectiveness of artillery aerial bombing and antitank shooting After World War II edit This section needs expansion with a link to future research You can help by adding to it March 2010 With expanded techniques and growing awareness of the field at the close of the war operational research was no longer limited to only operational but was extended to encompass equipment procurement training logistics and infrastructure Operations Research also grew in many areas other than the military once scientists learned to apply its principles to the civilian sector With the development of the simplex algorithm for linear programming in 1947 26 and the development of computers over the next three decades Operations Research can now solve problems with hundreds of thousands of variables and constraints Moreover the large volumes of data required for such problems can be stored and manipulated very efficiently 26 Much of operations research modernly known as analytics relies upon stochastic variables and a therefore access to truly random numbers Fortunately the cybernetics field also required the same level of randomness The development of increasingly better random number generators has been a boon to both disciplines Modern applications of operations research include city planning football strategies emergency planning optimizing all facets of industry and economy and undoubtedly with the likelihood of the inclusion of terrorist attack planning and definitely counterterrorist attack planning Problems addressed edit Critical path analysis or project planning identifying those processes in a complex project which affect the overall duration of the project Floorplanning designing the layout of equipment in a factory or components on a computer chip to reduce manufacturing time therefore reducing cost Network optimization for instance setup of telecommunications or power system networks to maintain quality of service during outages Allocation problems Facility location Assignment Problems Assignment problem Generalized assignment problem Quadratic assignment problem Weapon target assignment problem

is also used extensively in government where evidencebased policy is used Management science edit Main article Management science In 1967 Stafford Beer characterized the field of management science as the business use of operations research 29 However in modern times the term management science may also be used to refer to the separate fields of organizational studies or corporate strategy citation needed Like operational research itself management science MS is an interdisciplinary branch of applied mathematics devoted to optimal decision planning with strong links with economics business engineering and other sciences It uses various scientific research based principles strategies and analytical methods including mathematical modeling statistics and numerical algorithms to improve an organizations ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems Management scientists help businesses to achieve their goals using the scientific methods of operational research The management scientists mandate is to use rational systematic sciencebased techniques to inform and improve decisions of all kinds Of course the techniques of management science are not restricted to business applications but may be applied to military medical public administration charitable groups political groups or community groups Management science is concerned with developing and applying models and concepts that may prove useful in helping to illuminate management issues and solve managerial problems as well as designing and developing new and better models of organizational excellence 30 The application of these models within the corporate sector became known as management science 31 Related fields edit Some of the fields that have considerable overlap with Operations Research and Management Science include 32 Business analytics Computer science Data mining Data science Big data Decision analysis Decision intelligence Engineering Financial engineering Forecasting Game theory Geography Geographic information science Graph theory Industrial engineering Logistics Mathematical modeling Mathematical optimization Probability and statistics Project management Policy analysis Simulation Social network Transportation forecasting models Stochastic processes Supply chain management Systems

from reservoirs Health Services information and supply chain management Game Theory identifying understanding developing strategies adopted by companies Urban Design Computer Network Engineering packet routing timing analysis Telecom Data Communication Engineering packet routing timing analysis 33 Management is also concerned with socalled softoperational analysis which concerns methods for strategic planning strategic decision support problem structuring methods In dealing with these sorts of challenges mathematical modeling and simulation may not be appropriate or may not suffice Therefore during the past 30 years vague a number of nonquantified modeling methods have been developed These include citation needed stakeholder based approaches including metagame analysis and drama
