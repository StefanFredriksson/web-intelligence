Definition edit The American Engineers Council for Professional Development ECPD the predecessor of ABET 3 has defined engineering as The creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures machines apparatus or manufacturing processes or works utilizing them singly or in combination or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions all as respects an intended function economics of operation and safety to life and property 4 5 History edit Main article History of engineering Relief map of the Citadel of Lille designed in 1668 by Vauban the foremost military engineer of his age Engineering has existed since ancient times when humans devised inventions such as the wedge lever wheel and pulley etc The term engineering is derived from the word engineer which itself dates back to 1390 when an engineer literally one who builds or operates a siege engine referred to a constructor of military engines 6 In this context now obsolete an engine referred to a military machine ie a mechanical contraption used in war for example a catapult Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps eg the US Army Corps of Engineers The word engine itself is of even older origin ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium c 1250 meaning innate quality especially mental power hence a clever invention 7 Later as the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline the term civil engineering 5 entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such nonmilitary projects and those involved in the discipline of military engineering Ancient era edit The Ancient Romans built aqueducts to bring a steady supply of clean and fresh water to cities and towns in the empire The pyramids in ancient Egypt ziggurats of Mesopotamia the Acropolis and Parthenon in Greece the Roman aqueducts Via Appia and Colosseum Teotihuacán and the Brihadeeswarar Temple of Thanjavur among many others stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers Other monuments no longer standing such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Pharos of Alexandria were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World The six classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East The wedge and the inclined plane ramp were known since prehistoric times 8 The wheel along with the wheel and axle mechanism was invented in Mesopotamia modern Iraq during the 5th millennium BC 9 The lever mechanism first appeared around 5000 years ago in the Near East where it was used in a simple balance scale 10 and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology 11 The lever was also used in the shadoof waterlifting device the first crane machine which appeared in Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC 10 and then in ancient Egyptian technology circa 2000 BC 12 The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC 13 and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty 19911802 BC 14 The screw the last of the simple machines to be invented 15 first appeared in Mesopotamia during the NeoAssyrian period 911609 BC 16 The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines the inclined plane the wedge and the lever to create structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza 17 The earliest civil engineer known by name is Imhotep 5 As one of the officials of the Pharaoh Djosèr he probably designed and supervised the construction of the Pyramid of Djoser the Step Pyramid at Saqqara in Egypt around 26302611 BC 18 The earliest practical waterpowered machines the water wheel and watermill first appeared in the Persian Empire in what are now Iraq and Iran by the early 4th century BC 19 Ancient Greece developed machines in both civilian and military domains The Antikythera mechanism an early known mechanical analog computer 20 21 and the mechanical inventions of Archimedes are examples of Greek mechanical engineering Some of Archimedes inventions as well as the Antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or epicyclic gearing two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial Revolution and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as robotics and automotive engineering 22 Ancient Chinese Greek Roman and Hunnic armies employed military machines and inventions such as artillery which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC 23 the trireme the ballista and the catapult In the Middle Ages the trebuchet was developed Middle Ages edit The earliest practical windpowered machines the windmill and wind pump first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age in what are now Iran Afghanistan and Pakistan by the 9th century AD 24 25 26 27 The earliest practical steampowered machine was a steam jack driven by a steam turbine described in 1551 by Taqi alDin Muhammad ibn Maruf in Ottoman Egypt 28 29 The cotton gin was invented in India by the 6th century AD 30 and the spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early 11th century 31 both of which were fundamental to the growth of the cotton industry The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny which was a key development during the early Industrial Revolution in the 18th century 32 The crankshaft and camshaft were invented by AlJazari in Northern Mesopotamia circa 1206 33 34 35 and they later became central to modern machinery such as the steam engine internal combustion engine and automatic controls 36 The earliest programmable machines were developed in the Muslim world A music sequencer a programmable musical instrument was the earliest type of programmable machine The first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers described in their Book of Ingenious Devices in the 9th century 37 38 In 1206 AlJazari invented programmable automata robots He described four automaton musicians including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns 39 The castle clock a hydropowered mechanical astronomical clock invented by AlJazari was the first programmable analog computer 40 41 42 A waterpowered mine hoist used for raising ore ca 1556 Before the development of modern engineering mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen such as millwrights clockmakers instrument makers and surveyors Aside from these professions universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology 43 32 A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise De re metallica 1556 which also contains sections on geology mining and chemistry De re metallica was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years 43 Modern era edit The application of the steam engine allowed coke to be substituted for charcoal in iron making lowering the cost of iron which provided engineers with a new material for building bridges This bridge was made of cast iron which was soon displaced by less brittle wrought iron as a structural material The science of classical mechanics sometimes called Newtonian mechanics formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering 43 With the rise of engineering as a profession in the 18th century the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends Similarly in addition to military and civil engineering the fields then known as the mechanic arts became incorporated into engineering Canal building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the Industrial Revolution 44 John Smeaton was the first selfproclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the father of civil engineering He was an English civil engineer responsible for the design of bridges canals harbours and lighthouses He was also a capable mechanical engineer and an eminent physicist Using a model water wheel Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years determining ways to increase efficiency 45 127 Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels 43 69 Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the Newcomen steam engine Smeaton designed the third Eddystone Lighthouse 175559 where he pioneered the use of hydraulic lime a form of mortar which will set under water and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse He is important in the history rediscovery of and development of modern cement because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain hydraulicity in lime work which led ultimately to the invention of Portland cement Applied science lead to the development of the steam engine The sequence of events began with the invention the barometer and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by Evangelista Torricelli in 1643 demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by Otto von Guericke using the Magdeburg hemispheres in 1656 laboratory experiments by Denis Papin who built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a piston which he published in 1707 Edward Somerset 2nd Marquess of Worcester published a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a coffee percolator Samuel Morland a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that Thomas Savery read In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called The Miners Friend It employed both vacuum and pressure 46 Iron merchant Thomas Newcomen who built the first commercial piston steam engine in 1712 was not known to have any scientific training 45 32 Jumbo Jet The application of steam powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for blast furnaces lead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in blast furnaces which enabled the transition from charcoal to coke 47 These innovations lowered the cost of iron making horse railways and iron bridges practical The puddling process patented by Henry Cort in 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron Hot blast patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828 greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron With the development of the high pressure steam engine the power to weight ratio of steam engines made practical steamboats and locomotives possible 48 New steel making processes such as the Bessemer process and the open hearth furnace ushered in an area of heavy engineering in the late 19th century One of the most famous engineers of the mid 19th century was Isambard Kingdom Brunel who built railroads dockyards and steamships Offshore platform Gulf of Mexico The Industrial Revolution created a demand for machinery with metal parts which led to the development of several machine tools Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until John Wilkinson invented his boring machine which is considered the first machine tool 49 Other machine tools included the screw cutting lathe milling machine turret lathe and the metal planer Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing interchangeable parts lead to large scale factory production by the late 19th century 50 The United States census of 1850 listed the occupation of engineer for the first time with a count of 2000 51 There were fewer than 50 engineering graduates in the US before 1865 In 1870 there were a dozen US mechanical engineering graduates with that number increasing to 43 per year in 1875 In 1890 there were 6000 engineers in civil mining mechanical and electrical 52 There was no chair of applied mechanism and applied mechanics at Cambridge until 1875 and no chair of engineering at Oxford until 1907 Germany established technical universities earlier 53 The foundations of electrical engineering in the 1800s included the experiments of Alessandro Volta Michael Faraday Georg Ohm and others and the invention of the electric telegraph in 1816 and the electric motor in 1872 The theoretical work of James Maxwell see Maxwells equations and Heinrich Hertz in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of electronics The later inventions of the vacuum tube and the transistor further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty 5 Chemical engineering developed in the late nineteenth century 5 Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants 5 The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes 5 The solar furnace at Odeillo in the PyrénéesOrientales in France can reach temperatures up to 3500C 6330F Aeronautical engineering deals with aircraft design process design while aerospace engineering is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including spacecraft design Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of Sir George Cayley has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering 54 The first PhD in engineering technically applied science and engineering awarded in the United States went to Josiah Willard Gibbs at Yale University in 1863 it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the US 55 Only a decade after the successful flights by the Wright brothers there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in World War I Meanwhile research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining theoretical physics with experiments Main branches of engineering edit For a topical guide to this subject see Outline of engineering Hoover Dam Engineering is a broad discipline which is often broken down into several subdisciplines Although an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline he or she may become multidisciplined through experience Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches 56 57 58 chemical engineering

how and when to remove this template message Design of a turbine requires collaboration of engineers from many fields as the system involves mechanical electromagnetic and chemical processes The blades rotor and stator as well as the steam cycle all need to be carefully designed and optimized In the engineering design process engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions More than ever engineers are now required to have a proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects As a result many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career If multiple solutions exist engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify understand and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product rather it must also meet further requirements Constraints may include available resources physical imaginative or technical limitations flexibility for future modifications and additions and other factors such as requirements for cost safety marketability productivity and serviceability By understanding the constraints engineers derive specifications for

for a booster engine for steam locomotives Engineering is applied to design with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science Engineers use their knowledge of science mathematics logic economics and appropriate experience or tacit knowledge to find suitable solutions to a problem Creating an appropriate mathematical model of a problem often allows them to analyze it sometimes definitively and to test potential solutions 65 Usually multiple reasonable solutions exist so engineers must evaluate the different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements Genrich Altshuller after gathering statistics on a large number of patents suggested that compromises are at the heart of lowlevel engineering designs while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem 66 Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to fullscale production They use among other things prototypes scale models simulations destructive tests nondestructive tests and stress tests Testing ensures that products will perform as expected 67 Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large Engineers typically include a factor of safety in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure The study of failed products is known as forensic engineering and can help the product designer in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions The discipline is of greatest value after disasters such as bridge collapses when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure 68 Computer use edit A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a Space Shuttle orbiter during reentry Solutions to the flow require modelling of the combined effects of fluid flow and the heat equations As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors computers and software play an increasingly important role As well as the typical business application software there are a number of computer aided applications computeraided technologies specifically for engineering Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes which can be solved using numerical methods Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW demonstrating hyperlinks One of the most widely used design tools in the profession is computeraided design CAD software It enables engineers to create 3D models 2D drawings and schematics of their designs CAD together with digital mockup DMU and CAE software such as finite element method analysis or analytic element method allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and timeconsuming physical prototypes These allow products and components to be checked for flaws assess fit and assembly study ergonomics and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses temperatures electromagnetic emissions electrical currents and voltages digital logic levels fluid flows and kinematics Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of product data management software 69 There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as computeraided manufacturing CAM software to generate CNC machining instructions manufacturing process management software for production engineering EDA for printed circuit board PCB and circuit schematics for electronic engineers MRO applications for maintenance management and Architecture engineering and construction AEC software for civil engineering

companies in many established economies are facing significant challenges with regard to the number of professional engineers being trained compared with the number retiring This problem is very prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status 73 There are many negative economic and political issues that this can cause as well as ethical issues 74 It is widely agreed that the engineering profession faces an image crisis 75 rather than it being fundamentally an unattractive career Much work is needed to avoid huge problems in the UK and other western economies Code of

accurate observation of materials and phenomena Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations citation needed Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes Conversely in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena thus becoming for the moment scientists or more precisely engineering scientists citation needed The International Space Station is used to conduct science experiments of outer space In the book What Engineers Know and How They Know It 81 Walter Vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research First it often deals with areas in which the basic physics or chemistry are well understood but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner There is a real and important difference between engineering and physics as similar to any science field has to do with technology 82 83 Physics is an exploratory science that seeks knowledge of principles while engineering uses knowledge for practical applications of principles The former equates an understanding into a mathematical principle while the latter measures variables involved and creates technology 84 85 86 For technology physics is an auxiliary and in a way technology is considered as applied physics 87 Though physics and engineering are interrelated it does not mean that a physicist is trained to do an engineers job A physicist would typically require additional and relevant training 88 Physicists and engineers engage in different lines of work 89 But PhD physicists who specialize in sectors of engineering physics and applied physics are titled as Technology officer RD Engineers and System Engineers 90 An example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the NavierStokes equations to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft or the use of the Finite element method to calculate the stresses in complex components Second engineering research employs many semi empirical methods that are foreign to pure scientific research one example being the method of parameter variation citation needed As stated by Fung et al in the revision to the classic engineering text Foundations of Solid Mechanics Engineering is quite different from science Scientists try to understand nature Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature Engineers stress innovation and invention To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms and design something that people can use That something can be a complex system device a gadget a material a method a computing program an innovative experiment a new solution to a problem or an improvement on what already exists Since a design has to be realistic and functional it must have its geometry dimensions and characteristics data defined In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions Most often they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge Thus they studied mathematics physics chemistry biology and mechanics Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession Thus engineering sciences were born 91 Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles engineers must also take into account safety efficiency economy reliability and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution 92 Medicine and biology edit A 3 tesla clinical MRI scanner The study of the human body albeit from different directions and for different purposes is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines Medicine aims to sustain repair enhance and even replace functions of the human body if necessary through the use of technology Genetically engineered mice expressing green fluorescent protein which glows green under blue light The central mouse is wildtype Modern medicine can replace several of the bodys functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as for example brain implants and pacemakers 93 94 The fields of bionics and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems Conversely some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing biology with technology This has led to fields such as artificial intelligence neural networks fuzzy logic and robotics There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine 95 96 Both fields provide solutions to real world problems This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and empirical knowledge is an integral part of both Medicine in part studies the function of the human body The human body as a biological machine has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods 97 The heart for example functions much like a pump 98 the skeleton is like a linked structure with levers 99 the brain produces electrical signals etc 100 These similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of engineering principles in medicine led to the development of the field of biomedical engineering that uses concepts developed in both disciplines Newly emerging branches of science such as systems biology are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering such as systems modeling and computational analysis to the description of biological systems 97 Art edit Leonardo da Vinci seen here in a selfportrait has been described as the epitome of the artistengineer 101 He is also known for his studies on human anatomy and physiology There are connections between engineering and art for example architecture landscape

engineering IT systems business administration and change management Engineering management or Management engineering is a specialized field of management concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector The demand for managementfocused engineers or from the opposite perspective managers with an understanding of engineering has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles During an engineering management course students will develop industrial engineering skills knowledge and expertise alongside knowledge of business administration management techniques and strategic thinking Engineers specializing in change management must have indepth knowledge of the application of industrial and organizational psychology principles and methods Professional engineers often train as certified management consultants in the very specialized field of management consulting applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector This work often deals with large scale complex business transformation or Business process management initiatives in aerospace and defence automotive oil and gas machinery pharmaceutical food and beverage electrical electronics power distribution generation utilities and transportation systems This combination of technical engineering practice management consulting practice industry sector knowledge and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives These initiatives are typically sponsored by Clevel executives Other fields edit In political science the term engineering has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of
