History edit See also List of presidents of Dartmouth College Eleazar Wheelock Dartmouth College founder Dartmouth was founded by Eleazar Wheelock a Congregational minister from Columbia Connecticut who had sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries Wheelocks ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747 and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks 8 Wheelock founded Moors Indian Charity School in 1755 33 The Charity School proved somewhat successful but additional funding was necessary to continue schools operations and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money The first major donation to the school was given by Dr John Phillips in 1762 who would go on to found Phillips Exeter Academy Occom accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches With these funds they established a trust to help Wheelock 8 The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge 2nd Earl of Dartmouth The Charter of Dartmouth College on display in Baker Memorial Library The charter was signed on December 13 1769 on behalf of King George III of Great Britain Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution primarily because its location was far from tribal territories In seeking to expand the school into a college Wheelock relocated it to Hanover in the Province of New Hampshire The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter The Royal Governor of New Hampshire John Wentworth provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13 1769 issued a royal charter in the name of King George III establishing the College That charter created a college for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading writing all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity Schools unspent trust funds Named for William Legge 2nd Earl of Dartmouth an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelocks earlier efforts but who in fact opposed creation of the College and never donated to itDartmouth is the nations ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule 9 The College granted its first degrees in 1771 10 Given the limited success of the Charity School however Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites 8 34 Occom disappointed with Wheelocks departure from the schools original goal of Indian Christianization went on to form his own community of New England Indians called Brothertown Indians in New York 8 34 The earliest known

Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817 though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby 8 Daniel Webster an alumnus of the class of 1801 presented the Colleges case to the Supreme Court which found the amendment of Dartmouths charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshires takeover of the college Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words It is Sir as I have said a small college And yet there are those who love it 8 Dartmouth taught its first AfricanAmerican students in 1775 and 1808 By the end of the Civil War 20 black men had attended the college or its medical school 36 and Dartmouth was recognized in the AfricanAmerican community as a place where a man of color

period the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded 11 Under President William Jewett Tucker 18931909 Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities faculty and the student body following large endowments such as the 10000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux 39 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold Tucker is often credited for having refounded Dartmouth and bringing it into national prestige 40 Lithograph of the Presidents House Thornton Hall Dartmouth Hall and Wentworth Hall Presidents Ernest Fox Nichols 190916 and Ernest Martin Hopkins 191645 continued Tuckers trend of modernization further improving campus facilities and

admitting women as fulltime students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy 46 At about the same time the college adopted its Dartmouth Plan of academic scheduling permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities 45 In 1988 Dartmouths alma mater songs lyrics changed from Men of Dartmouth to Dear old Dartmouth 47 During the 1990s the

professional schools the Geisel School of Medicine established 1797 Thayer School of Engineering 1867which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciencesand Tuck School of Business 1900 With these professional schools and graduate programs conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of Dartmouth University 7 however because of historical and nostalgic

best universities in the nation 81 However this specific ranking has drawn criticism from scholars for not adequately adjusting for the size of an institution which leads to larger institutions ranking above smaller ones like Dartmouth 82 Similarly Dartmouths small size and its undergraduate focus disadvantage its ranking in international rankings because international ranking organizations use formulas that favor institutions with a large number of graduate students 83 The 2006 Carnegie Foundation classification listed Dartmouth as the only majorityundergraduate artsandsciences focused

education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading writing and all parts of Learning as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others 183 However Wheelock primarily intended the college to educate white youth and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Native American named Samson Occom and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college 184 The college graduated only 19 Native Americans during its first two hundred years 184 In 1970 the college established Native American academic and social programs as part of a new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment 184 Since then Dartmouth has graduated over 700 Native American students from over 200 different tribes more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined 184 Traditions edit Main article Dartmouth College traditions Snow sculpture at the 2004 Dartmouth Winter Carnival Dartmouth is well known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions 185 The college functions on a quarter system and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event known on campus as big weekends 186 187 or party weekends 188 In the fall term Homecoming officially called Dartmouth Night is marked by a bonfire on the Green constructed by the freshman class 189 Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports This tradition is the oldest in the United States and subsequently went on to catch on at other New England colleges 190 191 In the spring Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration 192 The summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the Connecticut River Begun in 1986 Tubestock was ended in 2006 by town ordinance 193 The Class of 2008 during their summer term on campus in 2006 replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock This new celebration includes a barbecue live music and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green Unlike Tubestock Fieldstock is funded and supported by the College 194 Another longstanding tradition is fourday studentrun Dartmouth Outing Club trips for incoming freshmen begun in 1935 Each trip concludes at the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge 195 In 2011 over 96 of freshmen elected to participate Insignia and other representations edit Motto and song edit Dartmouths motto chosen by Eleazar Wheelock is Vox clamantis in deserto The Latin motto is literally translated as A calling voice in the wilderness 196 197 but is more often rendered as A voice crying out in the wilderness 1 The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the colleges location on what was once the frontier of European settlement 197 198 Richard Hoveys Men of Dartmouth was elected as the best of Dartmouths songs in 1896 189 and became the schools official song in 1926 199 The song was retitled to Alma Mater in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men 200 Seal edit Main article Seal of Dartmouth College Seal of Dartmouth College Dartmouths 1769 royal charter required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas 183 The colleges founder Eleazar Wheelock designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel a missionary society founded in London in 1701 in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education 197 Engraved by a Boston silversmith the seal was ready by commencement of 1773 The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25 1773 describing it as mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 An Oval circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL COL DARTMUTH NOV HANT IN AMERICA 1770 within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words vox clamantis in deserto the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left and bearing in a Triangle irradiate with the Hebrew Words El Shaddai agreeable to the above Impression be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College 201 On October 28 1926 the trustees affirmed the charters reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone 197 The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer William Addison Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use Dwiggins design was modified during 1957 to change the date from 1770 to 1769 to accord with the date of the college charter The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of 1769 to replace the old dies now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use 197 The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032 202 Shield edit On October 28 1926 the trustees approved a Dartmouth College Shield for general use Artist and engraver W Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal This design does not survive On June 9 1944 the trustees approved another coat of arms based on the shield part of the seal this one by Canadian artist and designer Thoreau MacDonald That design was used widely and like Dwiggins seal had its date changed from 1770 to 1769 around 1958 197 That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others 202 College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s but it did not see the success of MacDonalds design 203 The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of Dartmouth Medical School and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across 204 The design has appeared on Rudolph Ruzicka s Bicentennial Medal Philadelphia Mint 1969 and elsewhere Nickname symbol and mascot edit Dartmouth has never had an official mascot 205 The nickname The Big Green 206 originating in the 1860s is based on students adoption of a shade of forest green Dartmouth Green as the schools official color in 1866 207 208 Beginning in the 1920s the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname the Indians a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists 205 This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s when its use came under criticism In 1974 the Trustees declared the use of the Indian symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education 209 Some alumni and students as well as the conservative student newspaper The Dartmouth Review have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence 210 but never succeeded in doing so 211 Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot but none has become official One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the Dartmouth JackOLantern was Keggy the Keg an anthropomorphic beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy 212 the mascot has received approval from only the student government 213 In November 2006 student government attempted to revive the Dartmoose as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot 214 Alumni edit Main article List of Dartmouth College alumni Dartmouths alumni are known for their devotion to the college 215 Most start by giving to
