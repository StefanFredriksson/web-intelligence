ontology encompasses a representation formal naming and definition of the categories properties and relations between the concepts data and entities that substantiate one many or all domains of discourse Every field creates ontologies to limit complexity and organize data into information and knowledge As new ontologies are made their use hopefully improves problem solving within that domain Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages 1 Since Google started an initiative called Knowledge Graph in 2012 a substantial amount of research has used the phrase knowledge graph as a generalized term Although there is no clear definition for the term knowledge graph it is sometimes erroneously used as synonym for ontology 2 One common interpretation is that a knowledge graph represents a collection of interlinked descriptions of entities realworld objects events situations or abstract concepts 3 Unlike ontologies knowledge graphs such as Googles Knowledge Graph often contain large volumes of factual information with less formal semantics In some contexts the term knowledge graph is used to refer to any knowledge base that is represented as a graph Contents 1 Etymology 2 Overview 3 History 4 Components 5 Types 51 Domain ontology 52 Upper

the verb εἰμί eimí ie to be I am and λογία logia ie logical discourse see classical compounds for this type of word formation 4 5 While the etymology is Greek the oldest extant record of the word itself the New Latin form ontologia appeared in 1606 in the work Ogdoas Scholastica by Jacob Lorhard Lorhardus and in 1613 in the Lexicon philosophicum by Rudolf Göckel Goclenius The first occurrence in English of ontology as recorded by the OED Oxford English Dictionary online edition 2008 came in Archeologia Philosophica Nova or New Principles of Philosophy by Gideon Harvey Overview edit What ontologies in both information science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities ideas and events with all their interdependent properties and relations according to a system of categories In both fields there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering eg Quine and Kripke in philosophy Sowa and Guarino in computer science 6 and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible eg foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy BFO and Cyc in artificial intelligence Applied ontology is considered a spiritual successor to prior work in philosophy however many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than first principles the existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects eg perdurantism and endurantism may be ontologically more primary than processes Every field uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories research and applications For instance the definition and ontology of economics is a primacy concern in Marxist economics 7 but also in other subfields of economics 8 An example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions such as determining what capital assets are at risk and by how much see risk management Artificial intelligence has retained the most attention regarding applied ontology in subfields like natural language processing within machine translation and knowledge representation but ontology editors are being used often in a range of fields like education without the intent to contribute to AI 9 History edit Main article Metaphysics History Main article Artificial intelligence History Ontologies arise out of the branch of philosophy known as metaphysics which deals with questions like what exists and what is the nature of reality One of five traditional branches of philosophy metaphysics is concerned with exploring existence through properties entities and relations such as those between particulars and universals intrinsic and extrinsic properties or essence and existence Metaphysics has been an ongoing topic of discussion since recorded history Since the mid1970s researchers in the field of artificial intelligence AI have recognized that knowledge engineering is the key to building large and powerful AI systems AI researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as computational models that enable certain kinds of automated reasoning which was only marginally successful In the 1980s the AI community began to use the term ontology to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledgebased systems In particular David Powers introduced the word ontology to AI to refer to real world or robotic grounding 10 11 12 publishing in 1990 literature reviews emphasizing grounded ontology in association with the call for papers for a AAAI Summer Symposium Machine Learning of Natural Language and Ontology with an expanded version published in SIGART Bulletin and included as a preface to the proceedings 13 Some researchers drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy 14 In 1993 the widely cited web page and paper Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing by Tom Gruber 15 used ontology as a technical term in computer science closely related to earlier idea of semantic networks and taxonomies Gruber introduced the term as a specification of a conceptualization An ontology is a description like a formal specification of a program of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents This definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of concept definitions but more general And it is a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy 16 Attempting to distance ontologies from taxonomies and similar efforts in knowledge modeling that rely on classes and inheritance Gruber stated 1993 Ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes class definitions and the subsumption relation but ontologies need not be limited to these forms Ontologies are also not limited to conservative definitions that is definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world 17 To specify a conceptualization one needs to state axioms that do constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms 18 As refinement of Grubers definition Feilmayr and Wöß 2016 stated An ontology is a formal explicit specification of a shared conceptualization that is characterized by high semantic expressiveness required for increased complexity 19 Components edit Main article Ontology components Contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities regardless of the language in which they are expressed Most ontologies describe individuals instances classes concepts attributes and relations In this section each of these components is discussed in turn Common components of ontologies include Individuals Instances or objects the basic or ground level objects Classes Sets collections concepts classes in programming types of objects or kinds of things Attributes Aspects properties features characteristics or parameters that objects and classes can have Relations Ways in which classes and individuals can be related to one another Function terms Complex structures formed from certain relations that can be used in place of an individual term in a statement Restrictions Formally stated descriptions of what must be true in order for some assertion to be accepted as input Rules Statements in the form of an ifthen antecedentconsequent sentence that describe the logical inferences that can be drawn from an assertion in a particular form Axioms Assertions including rules in a logical form that together comprise the overall theory that the ontology describes in its domain of application This definition differs from that of axioms in generative grammar and formal logic In those disciplines axioms include only statements asserted as a priori knowledge As used here axioms also include the theory derived from axiomatic statements Events The changing of attributes or relations Ontologies are commonly encoded using ontology languages Types edit Domain ontology edit A domain ontology or domainspecific ontology represents concepts which belong to a part of the world such as biology or politics Each domain ontology typically models domainspecific definitions of terms For example the word card has many different meanings An ontology about the domain of poker would model the playing card meaning of the word while an ontology about the domain of computer hardware would model the punched card and video card meanings Since domain ontologies are written by different people they represent concepts in very specific and unique ways and are often incompatible within the same project As systems that rely on domain ontologies expand they often need to merge domain ontologies by handtuning each entity or using a combination of software merging and handtuning This presents a challenge to the ontology designer Different ontologies in the same domain arise due to different languages different intended usage of the ontologies and different perceptions of the domain based on cultural background education ideology etc At present merging ontologies that are not developed from a common upper ontology is a largely manual process and therefore timeconsuming and expensive Domain ontologies that use the same upper ontology to provide a set of basic elements with which to specify the meanings of the domain ontology entities can be merged with less effort There are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies 20 but this area of research is still ongoing and its a recent event to see the issue sidestepped by having multiple domain ontologies using the same upper ontology like the OBO Foundry Upper ontology edit Main article Upper ontology An upper ontology or foundation ontology is a model of the common relations and objects that are generally applicable across a wide range of domain ontologies It usually employs a core glossary that contains the terms and associated object descriptions as they are used in various relevant domain ontologies Standardized upper ontologies available for use include BFO BORO method Dublin Core GFO Cyc SUMO UMBEL the Unified Foundational Ontology UFO 21 and DOLCE 22 23 WordNet has been considered an upper ontology by some and has been used as a linguistic tool for learning domain ontologies 24 Hybrid ontology edit The Gellish ontology is an example of a combination of an upper and a domain ontology Visualization edit A survey of ontology visualization methods is presented by Katifori et al 25 An updated survey of ontology visualization methods and tools was published by Dudás et al 26 The most established ontology visualization methods namely indented tree and graph visualization are evaluated by Fu et al 27 A visual language for ontologies represented in OWL is specified by the Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies VOWL 28 Engineering edit Main article Ontology engineering Ontology engineering also called ontology building is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain 29 It is a subfield of knowledge engineering that studies the ontology development process the ontology life cycle the methods and methodologies for building ontologies and the tools and languages that support them 30 31 Ontology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained in software applications and organizational procedures for a particular domain Ontology engineering offers a direction for overcoming semantic obstacles such as those related to the definitions of business terms and software classes Known challenges with ontology engineering include Ensuring the ontology is current with domain knowledge and term use Providing sufficient specificity and concept coverage for the domain of interest thus minimizing the content completeness problem Ensuring the ontology can support its use cases Editors edit This section does not cite any

creation of ontologies including extracting a domains terms from natural language text As building ontologies manually is extremely laborintensive and time consuming there is great motivation to automate the process Information extraction and text mining have been explored to automatically link ontologies to documents for example in the context of the BioCreative challenges 44 Languages edit Main article Ontology language An ontology language is a formal language used to encode an ontology There are a number of such languages for ontologies both proprietary and standardsbased Common Algebraic Specification Language is a general logicbased specification language developed within the IFIP working group 13 Foundations of System Specifications and is a de facto standard language for software specifications It is now being applied to ontology specifications in order to provide modularity and structuring mechanisms Common logic is ISO standard 24707 a specification of a family of ontology languages that can be accurately translated into each other The Cyc project has its own ontology language called CycL based on firstorder predicate calculus with some higherorder extensions DOGMA Developing OntologyGrounded Methods and Applications adopts the factoriented modeling approach to provide a higher level of semantic stability The Gellish language includes rules for its own extension and thus integrates an ontology with an ontology language IDEF5 is a software engineering method to develop and maintain usable accurate domain ontologies KIF is a syntax for firstorder

applications edit In general ontologies can be used beneficially in several fields Enterprise applications 90 A more concrete example is SAPPHIRE Health care or Situational Awareness and Preparedness for Public Health Incidences and Reasoning Engines which is a semantics based health information system capable of tracking and evaluating situations and occurrences that may affect public health Geographic information systems bring together data from different sources and benefit therefore from ontological metadata which helps to connect the semantics of the data 91 Domainspecific ontologies are extremely important in biomedical research which requires named entity disambiguation of various biomedical terms and abbreviations that have the same string of characters but represent different biomedical concepts For example CSF can represent Colony Stimulating Factor or Cerebral Spinal Fluid both of which are represented by the same term CSF in biomedical literature 92 This is why a large number of public ontologies are related to the life sciences Life science data science tools that fail to implement these types of biomedical ontologies will not be able to accurately determine causal relationships between concepts 93 See also edit Commonsense knowledge bases Concept map Controlled vocabulary Folksonomy Formal concept analysis Formal ontology Lattice Ontology Ontology alignment
