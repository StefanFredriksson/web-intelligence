engineering v t e Capability Maturity Model Integration CMMI is a process level improvement training and appraisal program Administered by the CMMI Institute a subsidiary of ISACA it was developed at Carnegie Mellon University CMU It is required by many United States Department of Defense DoD and US Government contracts especially in software development CMU claims CMMI can be used to guide process improvement across a project division or an entire organization CMMI defines the following maturity levels for processes Initial Managed Defined Quantitatively Managed and Optimizing Version 20 was published in 2018 Version 13 was published in 2010 and is the reference model for the remaining information in this wiki article CMMI is registered in the US Patent and Trademark Office by CMU

References 7 Official sources 8 External links Overview edit Characteristics of the maturity levels 2 Originally CMMI addresses three areas of interest Product and service development CMMI for Development CMMIDEV Service establishment management CMMI for Services CMMISVC and Product and service acquisition CMMI for Acquisition CMMIACQ In version 20 these three areas that previously had a separate model each were merged into a single model CMMI was developed by a group from industry government and the Software Engineering Institute SEI at CMU CMMI models provide guidance for developing or improving processes that meet the business goals of an organization A CMMI model may also be used as a framework for appraising the process maturity of the organization 2 By January 2013 the entire CMMI product suite was transferred from the SEI to the CMMI Institute a newly created organization at Carnegie Mellon 3 History edit CMMI was developed by the CMMI project which aimed to improve the usability of maturity models by integrating many different models into one framework The project consisted of members of industry government and the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute SEI The main sponsors included the Office of the Secretary of Defense OSD and the National Defense Industrial Association CMMI is the successor of the capability maturity model CMM or Software CMM The CMM was developed from 1987 until 1997 In 2002 version 11 was released version 12 followed in August 2006 and version 13 in November 2010 Some major changes in CMMI V13 4 are the support of agile software development 5 improvements to high maturity practices 6 and alignment of the representation staged and continuous 7 According to the Software Engineering Institute SEI 2008 CMMI helps integrate traditionally separate organizational functions set process improvement goals and priorities provide guidance for quality processes and provide a point of reference for appraising current processes 8 In March 2016 the CMMI Institute was acquired by ISACA CMMI topics edit Representation edit In version 13 CMMI existed in two representations continuous and staged 2 The continuous representation is designed to allow the user to focus on the specific processes that are considered important for the organizations immediate business objectives or those to which the organization assigns a high degree of risks The staged representation is designed to provide a standard sequence of improvements and can serve as a basis for comparing the maturity of different projects and organizations The staged representation also provides for an easy migration from the SWCMM to CMMI 2 In version 20 the above representation separation was cancelled and there is now only one cohesive model 9 Model framework v13 edit Further information Process area CMMI Depending on the areas of interest acquisition services development used the process areas it contains will vary 10 Process areas are the areas that will be covered by the organizations processes The table below lists the seventeen CMMI core process areas that are present for all CMMI areas of interest in version 13 Capability Maturity Model

published in documents called models each of which addresses a different area of interest Version 13 provides models for three areas of interest development acquisition and services CMMI for Development CMMIDEV v13 was released in November 2010 It addresses product and service development processes CMMI for Acquisition CMMIACQ v13 was released in November 2010 It addresses supply chain management acquisition and outsourcing processes in government and industry CMMI for Services CMMISVC v13 was released in November 2010 It addresses guidance for delivering services within an organization and to external customers Model v20 edit In version 20 DEV ACQ and SVC were merged into a single model where each process area potentially has a specific reference to one or more of these three aspects Trying to keep up with the industry the model also has explicit reference to agile aspects in some process areas Appraisal edit An organization cannot be certified in CMMI instead an organization is appraised Depending on the type of appraisal the organization can be awarded a maturity level rating 15 or a capability level achievement profile Many organizations find value in measuring their progress by conducting an appraisal Appraisals are typically conducted for one or more of the following reasons To determine how well the organizations processes compare to CMMI best practices and to identify areas where improvement can be made To inform external customers and suppliers of how well the organizations processes compare to CMMI best practices To meet the contractual requirements of one or more customers Appraisals of organizations using a CMMI model 11 must conform to the requirements defined in the Appraisal Requirements for CMMI ARC document There are three classes of appraisals A B and C which focus on identifying improvement opportunities and comparing the organizations processes to CMMI best practices Of these class A appraisal is the most formal and is the only one that can result in a level rating Appraisal teams use a CMMI model and ARCconformant appraisal method to guide their evaluation of the organization and their reporting of conclusions The appraisal results can then be used eg by a process group to plan improvements for the organization The Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement SCAMPI is an appraisal method that meets all of the ARC requirements 12 Results of a SCAMPI appraisal may be published if the appraised organization approves on the CMMI Web site of the SEI Published SCAMPI Appraisal Results SCAMPI also supports the conduct of ISOIEC 15504 also known as SPICE Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination assessments etc This approach promotes that members of the EPG and PATs be trained in the CMMI that an informal SCAMPI C appraisal be performed and that process areas be prioritized for improvement More modern approaches that involve the deployment of commercially available CMMIcompliant processes can significantly reduce the time to achieve compliance SEI has maintained statistics on the time to move up for organizations adopting the earlier Software CMM as well as CMMI 13 These statistics indicate that since 1987 the median times to move from Level 1 to Level 2 is 23 months and from Level 2 to Level 3 is an additional 20 months Since the release of the CMMI the median times to move from Level 1 to Level 2 is 5 months with median movement to Level 3 another 21 months These statistics are updated and published every six months in a maturity profile citation needed The Software Engineering Institutes SEI team software process methodology and the use of CMMI models can be used to raise the maturity level A new product called Accelerated Improvement Method 14 AIM combines the use of CMMI and the TSP 15 Security edit To address user security concerns two unofficial security guides are available Considering the Case for Security Content in CMMI for Services has one process area Security Management 16 Security by Design with CMMI for Development Version 13 has the following process areas OPSD Organizational Preparedness for Secure Development SMP Secure Management in Projects SRTS Security Requirements and Technical Solution SVV Security Verification and Validation While they do not affect maturity or capability levels these process areas can be reported in appraisal results 17 Applications edit The SEI published that 60 organizations measured increases of performance in the categories of cost schedule productivity quality and customer satisfaction 18 The median increase in performance varied between 14 customer satisfaction and 62 productivity However the CMMI model mostly deals with what processes should be implemented and not so much with how they can be implemented These results do not guarantee that applying CMMI will increase performance in every organization A small company with few resources may be less likely to benefit from CMMI this view is supported by the process maturity profile page 10 Of the small organizations 25 employees 705 are assessed at level 2 Managed while 528 of the organizations with 10012000 employees are rated at the highest level 5 Optimizing Turner Jain 2002 argue that although it is obvious there are large differences between CMMI and agile software development both approaches have much in common They believe neither way is the right way to develop software but that there are phases in a project where one of the two is better suited They suggest one should combine the different fragments of the methods into a new hybrid method Sutherland et al 2007 assert that a combination of Scrum and CMMI brings more adaptability and predictability than either one alone 19 David J Anderson 2005 gives hints on how to interpret CMMI in an agile manner 20 CMMI Roadmaps 21 which are a goaldriven approach to selecting and deploying relevant process areas from the CMMIDEV model can provide guidance and focus for effective CMMI adoption There are several CMMI roadmaps for the continuous representation each with a specific set of improvement goals Examples are the CMMI Project Roadmap 22 CMMI Product and Product Integration Roadmaps 23 and the CMMI Process and Measurements Roadmaps 24 These roadmaps combine the strengths of both the staged and the continuous representations The combination of the project management technique earned value management EVM with CMMI has been described Solomon 2002 To conclude with a similar use of CMMI Extreme Programming XP a software engineering method has been evaluated with CMMCMMI Nawrocki et al 2002 For example the XP requirements management approach which relies on oral communication was evaluated as not compliant with CMMI CMMI can be appraised using two different approaches staged and continuous The staged approach yields appraisal results as one of five maturity levels The continuous approach yields one of four capability levels The differences in these approaches are felt only in the appraisal the best practices are equivalent and result in equivalent process improvement results See also edit Capability
