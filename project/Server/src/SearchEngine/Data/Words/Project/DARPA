Arlington The agency is currently located in a new building at 675 North Randolph St The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA is an agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military Originally known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency ARPA the agency was created in February 1958 by President Dwight D Eisenhower in response to the Soviet launching of Sputnik 1 in 1957 By collaborating with academic industry and government partners DARPA formulates and executes research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science often beyond immediate US military requirements 4 DARPAfunded projects have provided significant technologies that influenced many nonmilitary fields such as computer networking and the basis for the modern Internet and graphical user interfaces in information technology DARPA is independent of other military research and development and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management DARPA has about 220 employees of whom approximately 100 are in management 5 The name of the organization first changed from its founding name ARPA to DARPA in March 1972 briefly changing back to ARPA in February 1993 only to revert to DARPA in March 1996 6 Contents 1 Mission 2 History 21 Early history 19581969 22 Later

DARPA achievements for the past 50 years Early history 19581969 edit The creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency ARPA was authorized by President Dwight D Eisenhower in 1958 for the purpose of forming and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science and able to reach far beyond immediate military requirements 4 the two relevant acts being the Supplemental Military Construction Authorization Air Force 8 Public Law 85325 and Department of Defense Directive 510515 in February 1958 Its creation was directly attributed to the launching of Sputnik and to US realization that the Soviet Union had developed the capacity to rapidly exploit military technology Initial funding of ARPA was 520 million 9 ARPAs first director Roy Johnson left a 160000 management job at General Electric for an 18000 job at ARPA 10 Herbert York from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was hired as his scientific assistant 11 Johnson and York were both keen on space projects but when NASA was established later in 1958 all space projects and most of ARPAs funding were transferred to it Johnson resigned and ARPA was repurposed to do highrisk highgain far out basic research a posture that was enthusiastically embraced by the nations scientists and research universities 12 ARPAs second director was Brigadier General Austin W Betts who resigned in early 1961 He was succeeded by Jack Ruina who served until 1963 13 Ruina the first scientist to administer ARPA managed to raise its budget to 250 million 14 It was Ruina who hired J C R Licklider as the first administrator of the Information Processing Techniques Office which played a vital role in creation of ARPANET the basis for the future Internet 15 Additionally the political and defense communities recognized the need for a highlevel Department of Defense organization to formulate and execute RD projects that would expand the frontiers of technology beyond the immediate and specific requirements of the Military Services and their laboratories In pursuit of this mission DARPA has developed and transferred technology programs encompassing a wide range of scientific disciplines that address the full spectrum of national security needs From 1958 to 1965 ARPAs emphasis centered on major national issues including space ballistic missile defense and nuclear test detection 16 During 1960 all of its civilian space programs were transferred to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA and the military space programs to the individual services This allowed ARPA to concentrate its efforts on the Project Defender defense against ballistic missiles Project Vela nuclear test detection and Project AGILE counterinsurgency RD programs and to begin work on computer processing behavioral sciences and materials sciences The DEFENDER and AGILE programs formed the foundation of DARPA sensor surveillance and directed energy RD particularly in the study of radar infrared sensing and xray gamma ray detection ARPA at this point 1959 played an early role in Transit also called NavSat a predecessor to the Global Positioning System GPS 17 Fastforward to 1959 when a joint effort between DARPA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory began to finetune the early explorers discoveries TRANSIT sponsored by the Navy and developed under the leadership of Dr Richard Kirschner at Johns Hopkins was the first satellite positioning system 18 19 During the late 1960s with the transfer of these mature programs to the Services ARPA redefined its role and concentrated on a diverse set of relatively small essentially exploratory research programs The agency was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA in 1972 and during the early 1970s it emphasized direct energy programs information processing and tactical technologies Concerning information processing DARPA made great progress initially through its support of the development of timesharing all modern operating systems rely on concepts invented for the Multics system developed by a cooperation among Bell Labs General Electric and MIT which DARPA supported by funding Project MAC at MIT with an initial twomilliondollar grant 20 DARPA supported the evolution of the ARPANET the first widearea packet switching network Packet Radio Network Packet Satellite Network and ultimately the Internet and research in the artificial intelligence fields of speech recognition and signal processing including parts of Shakey the robot 21 DARPA also funded the development of the Douglas Engelbart s NLS computer system and The Mother of All Demos and the Aspen Movie Map which was probably the first hypermedia system and an important precursor of virtual reality Later history 19701980 edit The Mansfield Amendment of 1973 expressly limited appropriations for defense research through ARPADARPA only to projects with direct military application Some who contend that the amendment devastated American science since ARPADARPA was a major funding source for basic science projects of the time the National Science Foundation never made up the difference as expected The resulting brain drain is also credited with boosting the development of the fledgling personal computer industry Some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research laboratories such as Xerox PARC Between 1976 and 1981 DARPAs major projects were dominated by air land sea and space technology tactical armor and antiarmor programs infrared sensing for spacebased surveillance highenergy laser technology for spacebased missile defense antisubmarine warfare advanced cruise missiles advanced aircraft and defense applications of advanced computing These largescale technological program demonstrations were joined by integrated circuit research which resulted in submicrometer electronic technology and electron devices that evolved into the VeryLargeScale Integration VLSI Program and the Congressionallymandated charged particle beam program Many of the successful programs were transitioned to the Services such as the foundation technologies in automatic target recognition space based sensing propulsion and materials that were transferred to the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization SDIO later known as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization BMDO now titled the Missile Defense Agency MDA Recent history 1981present edit During the 1980s the attention of the Agency was centered on information processing and aircraftrelated programs including the National Aerospace Plane NASP or Hypersonic Research Program The Strategic Computing Program enabled DARPA to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the Vietnam War In addition DARPA began to pursue new concepts for small lightweight satellites LIGHTSAT and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing submarine technology and armorantiarmor On February 4 2004 the agency shut down its so called LifeLog Project The projects aim would have been to gather in a single place just about everything an individual says sees or does 22 On October 28 2009 the agency broke ground on a new facility in Arlington Virginia a few miles from the Pentagon 23 In fall 2011 DARPA hosted the 100Year Starship Symposium with the aim of getting the public to start thinking seriously about interstellar travel 24 On June 5 2016 NASA and DARPA announced that it planned to build new Xplanes with NASAs plan setting to create a whole series of X planes over the next 10 years 25 In July 2016 it was announced that DARPA would bring a group of topnotch computer security experts to search for security vulnerabilities and create a fix that patches those vulnerabilities and it is called the Cyber Grand Challenge CGC 26 In June 2018 DARPA leaders demonstrated a number of new technologies that were developed within the framework of the GXVT program The goal of this program is to create a lightly armored combat vehicle of not very large dimensions which due to maneuverability and other tricks can successfully resist modern antitank weapon systems 27 DARPA history Play media The formative years 19581975 Play media The Cold War era 19751989 Play media The
