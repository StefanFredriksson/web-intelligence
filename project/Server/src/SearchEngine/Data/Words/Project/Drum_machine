percussion instruments or produce unique sounds Most modern drum machines allow users to program their own rhythms Drum machines may create sounds using analog synthesis or play prerecorded samples Drum machines have had a lasting impact on popular music The Roland TR808 introduced in 1980 significantly influenced the development of dance music and hip hop Its successor the TR909 introduced in 1983 heavily influenced techno and house The first drum machine to use samples of real drum kits the Linn LM1 was introduced in 1980 and adopted by rock and pop artists including Prince and Michael Jackson In the late 1990s software emulations began to overtake the popularity of physical drum machines Contents 1 History 11 Early drum machines 12 Drum sound synthesis 13 Programmable drum machines

edit The first programmable drum machine was invented by AlJazari an Arab engineer in the Artuqid Sultanate modern Turkey and described in The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices written in 1206 His programmable musical device featured four automaton musicians including two drummers that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties It was a programmable drum machine where pegs cams bump into little levers that operated the percussion The drummers could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around 1 Rhythmicon 1932 and Joseph Schillinger a music educator Rhythmicon 19301932 In 193032 the innovative and hardtouse Rhythmicon was developed by Léon Theremin at the request of Henry Cowell who wanted an instrument which could play compositions with multiple rhythmic patterns based on the overtone series that were far too hard to perform on existing keyboard instruments The invention could produce sixteen different rhythms each associated with a particular pitch either individually or in any combination including en masse if desired Received with considerable interest when it was publicly introduced in 1932 the Rhythmicon was soon set aside by Cowell and was virtually forgotten for decades The next generation of rhythm machines played only preprogrammed rhythms such as mambo tango or bossa nova Chamberlin Rhythmate 1957 In 1957 Harry Chamberlin an engineer from Iowa created the Chamberlin Rhythmate which allowed users to select between 14 tape loops of drum kits and percussion instruments performing various beats Like the Chamberlin keyboard the Rhythmate was intended for family singalongs Around 100 units were sold 2 First commercial product Wurlitzer Sideman 1959 Wurlitzer Sideman 1959 inner view In 1959 Wurlitzer released the Sideman which generates sounds mechanically by a rotating disc similarly to a music box A slider controls the tempo between 34 and 150 beats per minute Sounds can also be triggered individually through buttons on a control panel The Sideman was a success and drew criticism from musicians unions which ruled that it could only be used in cocktail lounges if the keyboardist was paid the wages of three musicians Wurlitzer ceased production of the Sideman in 1969 2 Raymond Scott 19601963 In 1960 Raymond Scott constructed the Rhythm Synthesizer and in 1963 a drum machine called Bandito the Bongo Artist Scotts machines were used for recording his album Soothing Sounds for Baby series 1964 First fully transistorized drum machines Seeburg

out left panel SeeburgGulbransen SelectARhythm an earliest fully transistorized rhythm machine During the 1960s implementation of rhythm machines were evolved into fully solidstate transistorized from early electromechanical with vacuum tubes and also size were reduced to desktop size from earlier floor type In the early 1960s a home organ manufacturer Gulbransen later acquired by Fender cooperated with an automatic musical equipment manufacturer Seeburg Corporation and released early compact rhythm machines Rhythm Prince PRP 3 although at that time these size were still as large as small guitar amp head due to the use of bulky electromechanical pattern generators Then in 1964 Seeburg invented a compact electronic rhythm pattern generator using diode matrix US Patent 3358068 in 1967 4 and fully transistorized electronic rhythm machine with preprogrammed patterns SelectARhythm SAR1 5 6 was released As the result of its robustness and enough compact size these rhythm machines were gradually installed on the electronic organ as accompaniment of organists and finally spread widely KeioGiken Korg Nippon Columbia and Ace Tone 19631967 Korg DoncaMatic DA20 1963 In the early 1960s a nightclub owner in Tokyo Tsutomu Katoh was consulted from a notable accordion player Tadashi Osanai about the rhythm machine he used for accompaniment in club Wurlitzer Side Man Osanai a graduate of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at University of Tokyo convinced Katoh to finance his efforts to build better one 7 In 1963 their new company KeioGiken later Korg released their first rhythm machine DoncaMatic DA20 using the vacuum tube circuits for sounds and mechanicalwheel for rhythm patterns It was a floortype machine with builtin speaker and featuring a keyboard for the manual play in addition to the multiple automatic rhythm patterns Its price was comparable with the average annual income of Japanese at that time 8 Then their effort was focused on the improvement of reliability and performance along with the size reduction and the cost down Unstable vacuum tube circuit was replaced with reliable transistor circuit on DoncaMatic DC11 in mid1960s and in 1966 bulky mechanicalwheel was also replaced with compact transistor circuit on DoncaMatic DE20 and DE11 In 1967 Mini Pops MP2 was developed as an option of Yamaha Electone electric organ and Mini Pops was established as a series of the compact desktop rhythm machine In the United States Mini Pops MP3 MP7 etc were sold under Univox brand by the distributor at that time Unicord Corporation 8 In 1965 Nippon Columbia filed a patent for an automatic rhythm instrument It described it as an automatic rhythm player which is simple but capable of electronically producing various rhythms in the characteristic tones of a drum a piccolo and so on It has some similarities to Seeburgs slightly earlier 1964 patent 9 In 1967 Ace Tone founder Ikutaro Kakehashi later founder of Roland Corporation developed the preset rhythmpattern generator using diode matrix circuit which has some similarities to the earlier Seeburg and Nippon Columbia patents Kakehashis patent describes his device as a plurality of inverting circuits andor clipper circuits which are connected to a counting circuit to synthesize the output signal of the counting circuit where the synthesized output signal becomes a desired rhythm 10 Ace Tone commercialized its preset rhythm machine called the FR1 Rhythm Ace in 1967 It offered 16 preset patterns and four buttons to manually play each instrument sound cymbal claves cowbell and bass drum The rhythm patterns could also be cascaded together by pushing multiple rhythm buttons simultaneously and the possible combination of rhythm patterns were more than a hundred on the later models of Rhythm Ace the individual volumes of each instrument could be adjusted with the small knobs or faders The FR1 was adopted by the Hammond Organ Company for incorporation within their latest organ models In the US the units were also marketed under the Multivox brand by Peter Sorkin Music Company and in the UK marketed under the Bentley Rhythm Ace brand 11 Early preset drum machine users A number of other preset drum machines were released in the 1970s but early examples of the use can be found on The United States of America s eponymous album from 19678 The first major pop song to use a drum machine was Saved by the Bell by Robin Gibb which reached 2 in Britain in 1969 Drum machine tracks were also heavily used on the Sly the Family Stone album Theres a Riot Goin On released in 1971 Sly the Family Stone was the first group to have a number 1 pop single that used a drum machine that single was Family Affair 12 The German krautrock band Can also used a drum machine on their song Peking O The 1972 Timmy Thomas single Why Cant We Live Together Funky Me featured a distinctive use of a drum machine and keyboard arrangement on both tracks Another early example of electronic drums used by a rock group is Obscured by Clouds by Pink Floyd from early in 1972 The first album on which a drum machine produced all the percussion was Kingdom Come s Journey recorded in November 1972 using a Bentley Rhythm Ace French singersongwriter Léo Ferré mixed a drum machine with a symphonic orchestra in the song Je taimais bien tu sais in his album LEspoir released in 1974 Miles Davis live band began to utilize a drum machine in 1974 played by percussionist James Mtume which can be heard on Dark Magus 1977 Osamu Kitajima s progressive psychedelic rock album Benzaiten 1974 also utilized drum machines and one of the albums contributors Haruomi Hosono 13 would later start the electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra as Yellow Magic Band in 1977 14 Drum sound synthesis edit A key difference between such early machines and more modern equipment is that they use sound synthesis rather than digital sampling in order to generate their sounds For example a snare drum or maraca sound would typically be created using a burst of white noise whereas a bass drum sound would be made using sine waves or other basic waveforms This meant that while the resulting sound was not very close to that of the real instrument each model tended to have a unique character For this reason many of these early machines have achieved a certain cult status and are now sought after by producers for use in production of modern electronic music most notably the Roland TR808 15 Programmable drum machines edit Eko ComputeRhythm 1972 one of the first programmable drum machines PAiA Programmable Drum Set 1975 one of the earliest electronically programmable drum machines In 1972 Eko released the ComputeRhythm 1972 which was the first programmable drum machine citation needed It had a 6row pushbutton matrix that allowed the user to enter a pattern manually The user could also push punch cards with preprogrammed rhythms through a reader slot on the unit 16 Another standalone drum machine released in 1975 the PAiA Programmable Drum Set was also one of the first programmable drum machines 17 and was sold as a kit with parts and instructions which the buyer would use to build the machine In 1975 citation needed Ace Tone released the Rhythm Producer FR15 that enables the modification of the preprogrammed rhythm patterns 18 In 1978 Roland released the Roland CR78 the first microprocessor based programmable rhythm machine 11 with four memory storage for user patterns In 1979 a simpler version with four sounds Boss DR55 was released citation needed Digital sampling edit Linn LM1 1980 The Linn LM1 Drum Computer released in 1980 at 4995 was the first drum machine to use digital samples It also featured revolutionary rhythmic concepts such as swing factors shuffle accent and realtime programming all of which have since rooted themselves in beat box technology 19 Only about 500 were ever made but its effect on the music industry was extensive Its distinctive sound almost defines 1980s pop and it can be heard on hundreds of hit records from the era including The Human League s Dare Gary Numan s Dance Devo s New Traditionalists and Ric Ocasek s Beatitude Prince bought one of the very first LM1s and used it on nearly all of his most popular albums including 1999 and Purple Rain Many of the drum sounds on the LM1 were composed of two chips that were triggered at the same time and each voice was individually tunable with individual outputs Due to memory limitations a crash cymbal sound was not available except as an expensive thirdparty modification A cheaper version of the LM1 was released in 1982 called the LinnDrum Priced at 2995 not all of its voices were tunable but crash cymbal was included as a standard sound Like its predecessor the LM1 it featured swappable sound chips The LinnDrum can be heard on records such as The Cars Heartbeat City and Giorgio Moroder s soundtrack for the film Scarface It was feared the LM1 would put every session drummer in Los Angeles out of work and it caused many of LAs top session drummers Jeff Porcaro is one example to purchase their own drum machines and learn to program them themselves in order to stay employed Linn even marketed the LinnDrum specifically to drummers 20 Oberheim DMX 1981 SCI Drumtraks 1984 Following the success of the LM1 Oberheim introduced the DMX which also featured digitally sampled sounds and a swing feature similar to the one found on the Linn machines It became very popular in its own right becoming a staple of the nascent hiphop scene Other manufacturers soon began to produce machines eg the Sequential Circuits DrumTraks and Tom the Emu Drumulator and the Yamaha RX11 In 1986 the SpecDrum by Cheetah Marketing an inexpensive 8bit sampling drum external module for the ZX Spectrum 21 was introduced with a price less of than 30 when similar models cost around 250 22 Roland TR808 and TR909 edit See also Roland TR808 and Roland TR909 Roland TR808 Rhythm Composer 1980 In 1980 the Roland Corporation launched the TR808 Rhythm Composer It was one of the earliest programmable drum machines with which users could create their own rhythms rather than having to use preset patterns Unlike the more expensive LM1 the 808 is completely analog meaning its sounds are generated nondigitally via hardware rather than samples prerecorded sounds 23 Launched when electronic music had yet to become mainstream the 808 received mixed reviews for its unrealistic drum sounds and was a commercial failure 24 25 Having built approximately 12000 units Roland discontinued the 808 after its semiconductors became impossible to restock 26 Over the course of the 1980s the 808 attracted a cult following among underground musicians for its affordability on the used market 25 ease of use 24 and idiosyncratic sounds particularly its deep booming bass drum 26 It became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic dance and hip hop genres popularized by early hits such as Marvin Gaye s Sexual Healing 26 and Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force s Planet Rock 27 The 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine 28 its popularity with hip hop in particular has made it one of the most influential inventions in popular music comparable to the Fender Stratocaster s influence on rock 29 30 Its sounds continue to be used as samples included with music software and modern drum machines 31 The 808 was followed in 1983 by the TR909 the first Roland drum machine to use MIDI 32 which synchronizes devices built by different manufacturers 33 It was also the first Roland drum machine to use samples for some sounds 33 Like the 808 the 909 was a commercial failure but had a lasting influence on popular music after cheap units circulated on the used market alongside the Roland TB303 bass synthesizer it influenced the development of electronic genres such as techno house and acid 34 35 Later machines edit Emu SP1200 Alesis SR16 1991 By 2000 standalone drum machines had become less common partly supplanted by generalpurpose hardware samplers controlled by sequencers builtin or external softwarebased sequencing and sampling and the use of loops and music workstations with integrated sequencing and drum sounds TR808 and other digitized drum machine sounds can be found in archives on the Internet However traditional drum machines are still being made by companies such as Roland Corporation under the name Boss Zoom Korg and Alesis whose SR16 drum machine has remained popular since it was introduced in 1991 There are percussionspecific sound modules that can be triggered by pickups trigger pads or through MIDI These are called drum modules the Alesis D4 and Roland TD8 are popular examples Unless such a sound module also features a sequencer it is strictly speaking not a drum machine Programming edit See also Music sequencer 4onthefloor on Roland TR707 Programming of drum machines varies from product to product On most products it can be done in real time the user creates drum patterns by pressing the trigger pads as though a drum kit were being played or using stepsequencing the pattern is built up over time by adding individual sounds at certain points by placing them as with the TR808 and TR909 along a 16step bar For example a generic 4onthefloor dance pattern could be made by placing a closed high hat on the 3rd 7th 11th and 15th steps then a kick drum on the 1st 5th 9th and 13th steps and a clap or snare on the 5th and 13th This pattern could be varied in a multitude of ways to obtain fills breakdowns and other elements that the programmer sees fit which in turn could be sequenced with songsequence essentially the drum machine plays back the programmed patterns from memory in an order the programmer has chosen The machine will quantize entries that are slightly offbeat in order to make them exactly in time If the drum machine has MIDI connectivity then one could program the drum machine with a computer or another MIDI device Comparison with live drumming edit While drum machines have been used much in popular music since the 1980s scientific studies show there are certain aspects of humancreated rhythm that machines cannot replicate or can only replicate poorly such as the feel of human drumming and the ability of a human drummer to respond to changes in a song as it is being played live onstage 36 Human drummers also have the ability to make slight variations in their playing such as playing ahead of the beat or behind the beat for sections of a song in contrast to a drum machine that plays a preprogrammed rhythm As well human drummers play a tremendously wide variety of rhythmic variations that drum machines cannot reproduce 36 Labor costs edit Drum machines developed out of a need to create drum beats when a drum kit was not available Increasingly drum machines and drum programming are used by major record labels to undercut the costly expense of studio drummers 37 See also edit Electronic drum Groovebox generic groove machines Music sequencer References edit Noel Sharkey A 13th Century Programmable Robot Archive University of
