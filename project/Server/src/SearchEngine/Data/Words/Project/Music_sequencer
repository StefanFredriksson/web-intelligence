Audio plugin The advent of Musical Instrument Digital Interface MIDI and the Atari ST home computer in the 1980s gave programmers the opportunity to design software that could more easily record and play back sequences of notes played or programmed by a musician This software also improved on the quality of the earlier sequencers which tended to be mechanical sounding and were only able to play back notes of exactly equal duration Softwarebased sequencers allowed musicians to program performances that were more expressive and more human These new sequencers could also be used to control external synthesizers especially rackmounted sound modules and it was no longer necessary for each synthesizer to have its own devoted keyboard As the technology matured sequencers gained more features such as the ability to record multitrack audio Sequencers used for audio recording are called digital audio workstations or DAWs Many modern sequencers can be used to control virtual instruments implemented as software plugins This allows musicians to replace expensive and cumbersome standalone synthesizers with their software equivalents Today the term sequencer is often used to describe software However hardware sequencers still exist Workstation keyboards have their own proprietary builtin MIDI sequencers Drum machines and some older synthesizers have their own step sequencer built in There are still also standalone hardware MIDI sequencers although the market demand for those has diminished greatly due to the greater feature set of their software counterparts Types of music sequencer edit Music sequencers can be categorized by handling data types such as MIDI data on the MIDI sequencers implemented as hardware or software 3 CVGate data on the analog sequencers 4 and possibly others via CVGate interfaces Automation data for mixingautomation on the DAWs note 2 5 and the software effect instrument plugins on the DAWs with sequencing features Audio data on the audio sequencers 6 note 3 including DAW loopbased music software etc or the phrase samplers including Groove machines etc Alternative subsets of audio sequencers include Digital audio workstation DAW Hard disk recorder a class of audio software or dedicated system primarily designed to record edit and play back digital audio first appeared in the late 1970s and emerging since the 1990s After the 1990s2000s several DAWs for music production were integrated with music sequencer In today DAW integrated with MIDI sequencer is often simply abbreviated as DAW or sometimes referred as Audio and MIDI sequencer 7 etc On the later usage the term audio sequencer is just a synonym for the DAW Loopbased music software a class of music software for Loop based music compositions and remix emerging since late 1990s Typical software included ACID Pro 1998 Ableton Live 2001 GarageBand 2004 etc And now several of them are referred as DAW resulting of the expansions andor integrations Its core feature pitchtime manipulation allows user to handle audio samples loops with the analogy of MIDI data in several aspects user can designate Pitches and Durations independently on short music samples as on MIDI notes to remix a song This type of software really controls sequences of audio samples thus possibly we can call it an audio sequencer Tracker music software a class of software music sequencer with embedded sample players developed since the 1980s Although it provides earlier sequence of sampling sound similar to grooveboxes and later loopbased music software its design is slightly dated and rarely referred as audio sequencer Phrase sampler or phrase sampling similar to above musicians or remixers sometimes remixed or composed songs by sampling relatively long phrases or part of songs and then rearranging these on grooveboxes or a combination of sampler musical instrument and sequencer This technique is possibly referred as audio sequencing Beat slicing before the DAW became popular several musicians sometimes derived various beats from limited drum sample Loop by slicing beats and rearranging them on samplers This technique was popularized with the introduction of beat slicer tool especially the ReCycle released in 1992 Possibly it may be one origin of audio sequencing Also music sequencer can be categorized by its construction and supporting modes Realtime sequencer realtime recording mode edit A realtime sequencer on the synthesizer See also Digital sequencers List of music sequencers Digital sequencers and List of music sequencers Software sequencers and DAWs with sequencing features Realtime sequencers record the musical notes in realtime as on audio recorders and play back musical notes with designated tempo quantizations and pitch For editing usually punch inpunch out features originated in the tape recording are provided although it requires sufficient skills to obtain the desired result For detailed editing possibly another visual editing mode under graphical user interface may be more suitable Anyway this mode provides usability similar to audio recorders already familiar to musicians and it is widely supported on software sequencers DAWs and builtin hardware sequencers Analog sequencer edit An analog sequencer See also Analog sequencers and List of music sequencers Analog sequencers Analog sequencers are typically implemented with analog electronics and play the musical notes designated by a series of knobs or sliders corresponding to each musical note step It is designed for both composition and live performance users can change the musical notes at any time without regarding recording mode And also possibly the timeinterval between each musical note length of each step can be independently adjustable Typically analog sequencers are used to generate the repeated minimalistic phrases which may be reminiscent of Tangerine Dream Giorgio Moroder or trance music Step sequencer step recording mode edit A steprhythmsequencer on the drum machine A step note sequencer on the bass machine See also Step sequencers and List of music sequencers Step sequencers supported on On step sequencers musical notes are rounded into steps of equal timeintervals and users can enter each musical note without exact timing instead the timing and duration of each step can be designated in several different ways On the drum machines select a trigger timing from a row of stepbuttons On the bass machines select a step note or rest from a chromatic keypads then select a step duration or tie from a group of length buttons sequentially On the several home keyboards in addition to the realtime sequencer a pair of step trigger button is provided using it notes on the prerecorded sequence can be triggered in arbitrary timings for the timing dedicated recordings or performances See List of music sequencersStep sequencers supported on In general step mode along with roughly quantized semirealtime mode is often supported on the drum machines bass machines and several groove machines Software sequencer edit See also List of music sequencers Software sequencers and DAWs with sequencing features Software sequencer is a class of application software providing a functionality of music sequencer and often provided as one feature of the DAW or the integrated music authoring environments The features provided as sequencers vary widely depending on the software even an analog sequencer can be simulated The user may control the software sequencer either by using the graphical user interfaces or a specialized input devices such as a MIDI controller Typical features on software sequencers Numerical editor on Tracker Score editor Piano roll editor with strip chart Audio and MIDI tracks on DAW Automated software studio environment including instruments and effect processors Loop sequencer Sample editor with beat slicer Vocal editor for pitch and timing History edit Early sequencers edit See also CategoryMechanical musical instruments and Music box Evolving box production Barrel with pins on a large stationary barrel organ Music roll on barrel organ The early music sequencers were sound producing devices such as automatic musical instruments music boxes mechanical organs player pianos and Orchestrions Player pianos for example had much in common with contemporary sequencers Composers or arrangers transmitted music to piano rolls which were subsequently edited by technicians who prepared the rolls for mass duplication Eventually consumers were able to purchase these rolls and play them back on their own player pianos The origin of automatic musical instruments seems remarkably old As early as the 9th century the Persian Iranian Banū Mūsā brothers invented a hydropowered organ using exchangeable cylinders with pins 8 and also an automatic flute playing machine using steam power 9 10 as described in their Book of Ingenious Devices The Banu Musa brothers automatic flute player was the first programmable music sequencer device 11 and the first example of repetitive music technology powered by hydraulics 12 In 1206 AlJazari an Arab engineer invented programmable musical automata 13 13 a robot band which performed more than fifty facial and body actions during each musical selection 14 It was notably the first programmable drum machine Among the four automaton musicians were two drummers It was a drum machine where pegs cams bump into little levers that operated the percussion The drummers could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around 15 In the 14th century rotating cylinders with pins were used to play a carillon steam organ in Flanders citation needed and at least in the 15th century barrel organs were seen in the Netherlands 16 Play media Player piano 1920 controlled by piano roll RCA Mark II 1957 controlled via wide punched paper roll In the late18th or early19th century with technological advances of the Industrial Revolution various automatic musical instruments were invented Some examples music boxes barrel organs and barrel pianos consisting of a barrel or cylinder with pins or a flat metal disc with punched holes or mechanical organs player pianos and orchestrions using book music music rolls piano rolls with punched holes etc These instruments were disseminated widely as popular entertainment devices prior to the inventions of phonographs radios and sound films which eventually eclipsed all such home music production devicesOf them all punchedpapertape media had been used until the mid20th century The earliest programmable music synthesizers including the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer in 1957 and the Siemens Synthesizer in 1959 were also controlled via punch tapes similar to piano rolls 17 18 19 Additional inventions grew out of sound film audio technology The drawn sound technique which appeared in the late 1920s is notable as a precursor of todays intuitive graphical user interfaces In this technique notes and various sound parameters are triggered by handdrawn black ink waveforms directly upon the film substrate hence they resemble piano rolls or the strip charts of the modern sequencersDAWs Drawn soundtrack was often used in early experimental electronic music including the Variophone developed by Yevgeny Sholpo in 1930 and the Oramics designed by Daphne Oram in 1957 and so forth Analog sequencers edit Earliest commercially available analog sequencers bottom on Buchla 100 19641966 20 Moog

Scott an American composer of electronic music invented various kind of music sequencers for his electric compositions The Wall of Sound once covered on the wall of his studio in New York during the 1940s1950s was an electromechanical sequencer to produce rhythmic patterns consisting of stepping relays used on dial pulse telephone exchange solenoids control switches and tone circuits with 16 individual oscillators 21 Later Robert Moog would explain it in such terms as the whole room would go clack clack clack and the sounds would come out all over the place 22 The Circle Machine developed in 1959 had dimmer bulbs arranged in a ring and a rotating arm with photocell scanning over the ring to generate an arbitrary waveform Also the rotating speed of the arm was controlled via the brightness of lights and as a result arbitrary rhythms were generated 23 Clavivox developed since 1952 was a kind of keyboard synthesizer with sequencer verification needed On its prototype a theremin manufactured by young Robert Moog was utilized to enable portamento over 3octave range and on later version it was replaced by a pair of photographic film and photocell for controlling the pitch by voltage 22 In 1968 Ralph Lundsten and Leo Nilsson had a polyphonic synthesizer with sequencer called Andromatic built for them by Erkki Kurenniemi 24 Step sequencers edit Electromechanical disc

remove this template message The step sequencer s played rigid patterns of notes using a grid of usually 16 buttons or steps each step being 116 of a measure These patterns of notes were then chained together to form longer compositions Sequencers of this kind are still in use mostly built into drum machines and grooveboxes They are monophonic by nature although some are multitimbral meaning that they can control several different sounds but only play one note on each of those sounds clarification needed Early computers edit Main article Computer music CSIRAC played the earliest computer music in 1951 On the other hand software sequencers were continuously utilized since the 1950s in the context of computer music including computer played music software sequencer computer composed music music synthesis and computer sound generation sound synthesis In June 1951 the first computer music Colonel Bogey was played on CSIRAC Australias first digital computer 28 29 In 1956 Lejaren Hiller at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign wrote one of the earliest programs for computer music composition on ILLIAC and collaborated on the first piece Illiac Suite for String Quartet with Leonard Issaction 30 In 1957 Max Mathews at Bell Labs wrote MUSIC the first widely used program for sound generation and a 17second composition was performed by the IBM 704 computer Subsequently computer music was mainly researched on the expensive mainframe computers in computer centers until the 1970s when minicomputers and then microcomputers became available in this field In Japan experiments in computer music date back to 1962 when Keio University professor Sekine and Toshiba engineer Hayashi experimented with the TOSBAC computer This resulted in a piece entitled TOSBAC Suite 31 DDP24 S Block expansion card rack unit that is assumed the AD converters used for GROOVE 1970 by Max Mathews In 1965 32 Mathews and L Rosler developed Graphic 1 an interactive graphical sound system that implies sequencer on which one could draw figures using a lightpen that would be converted into sound simplifying the process of composing computer generated music 33 34 It used PDP5 minicomputer for data input and IBM 7094 mainframe computer for rendering sound Also in 1970 Mathews and F R Moore developed the GROOVE Generated Realtime Output Operations on Voltagecontrolled Equipment system 35 a first fully developed music synthesis system for interactive composition that implies sequencer and realtime performance using 3C Honeywell DDP24 36 or DDP224 37 minicomputers It used a CRT display to simplify the management of music synthesis in realtime 12bit DA for realtime sound playback an interface for analog devices and even several controllers including a musical keyboard knobs and rotating joysticks to capture realtime performance 33 37 34 EMS Sequencer 256 1971 branched from Synthi 100 Digital sequencers edit In 1971 Electronic Music Studios EMS released one of the first digital sequencer products as a module of Synthi 100 and its derivation Synthi Sequencer series 38 39 After then Oberheim released the DS2 Digital Sequencer in 1974 40 and Sequential Circuits released Model 800 in 1977 41 Synclavier I 1977 Fairlight CMI 1979 supporting MCL sequencer Music workstations edit See also Music workstation In 1975 New England Digital NED released ABLE computer microcomputer 42 as a dedicated data processing unit for Dartmouth Digital Synthesizer 1973 and based on it later Synclavier series were developed The Synclavier I released in September 1977 43 was one of the earliest digital music workstation product with multitrack sequencer Synclavier series evolved throughout the late1970s to the mid1980s and they also established integration of digitalaudio and musicsequencer on their DirecttoDisk option in 1984 and later Tapeless Studio system Page R on Fairlight In 1982 renewed the Fairlight CMI Series II and added new sequencer software Page R which combined step sequencing with sample playback 44 Yamaha s GS1 their first FM digital synthesizer was released in 1980 45 To program the synthesizer Yamaha built a custom computer workstation designed to be used as a sequencer for the GS1 citation needed failed verification It was only available at Yamahas headquarters in Japan Hamamatsu and the United States Buena Park citation needed Standalone CVGate sequencers edit While there were earlier microprocessorbased sequencers for digital polyphonic synthesizers note 4 their early products tended to prefer the newer internal digital buses than the oldstyle analogue CVGate interface once used on their prototype system Then in the early1980s they also rerecognized the needs of CVGate interface and supported it along with MIDI as options Roland MC8 Microcomposer 1977 In 1977 Roland Corporation released the MC8 Microcomposer also called computer music composer by Roland It was an early standalone microprocessor based digital CVGate sequencer 46 47 and an early polyphonic sequencer 48 49 It equipped a keypad to enter notes as numeric codes 16 KB of RAM for a maximum of 5200 notes large for the time and a polyphony function which allocated multiple pitch CVs to a single Gate 50 It was capable of eightchannel polyphony allowing the creation of polyrhythmic sequences 51 46 47 The MC8 had a significant impact on popular electronic music with the MC8 and its descendants such as the Roland MC4 Microcomposer impacting popular electronic music production in the 1970s and 1980s more than any other family of sequencers 51 The MC8s earliest known users were Yellow Magic Orchestra in 1978 52 MIDI sequencers edit Main article MIDI See also Comparison of MIDI standards Comparison of MIDI editors and sequencers and Groovebox In June 1981 Roland Corporation founder Ikutaro Kakehashi proposed the concept of standardization between different manufacturers instruments as well as computers to Oberheim Electronics founder Tom Oberheim and Sequential Circuits president Dave Smith In October 1981 Kakehashi Oberheim and Smith discussed the concept with representatives from Yamaha Korg and Kawai 53 In 1983 the MIDI standard was unveiled by Kakehashi and Smith 54 55 The first MIDI sequencer was the Roland MSQ700 released in 1983 56 It was not until the advent of MIDI that generalpurpose computers started to play a role as sequencers Following the widespread adoption of MIDI computerbased MIDI sequencers were developed MIDIto CVGate converters were then used to enable analogue synthesizers to be controlled by a MIDI sequencer 47 Since its introduction MIDI has remained the musical instrument industry standard interface through to the present day 57 Personal computers edit See also MIDI Computer music Sampler musical instrument Audio sequencer and Music tracker In 1978 Japanese personal computers such as the Hitachi Basic Master equipped the lowbit DA converter to generate sound which can be sequenced using Music Macro Language MML 58 This was used to produce chiptune video game music 31 Moog Song Producer 1983 MIDI CVGate interface on SynAmp It was not until the advent of MIDI introduced to the public in 1983 that generalpurpose computers really started to play a role as software sequencers 47 NEC s personal computers the PC88 and PC98 added support for MIDI sequencing with MML programming in 1982 31 In 1983 Yamaha modules for the MSX featured music production capabilities 59 60 realtime FM synthesis with sequencing MIDI sequencing 61 60 and a graphical user interface for the software sequencer 62 60 Also in 1983 Roland Corporation s CMU800 sound module introduced music synthesis and sequencing to the PC Apple II 63 and Commodore 64 64 The spread of MIDI on personal computers was facilitated by Rolands MPU401 released in 1984 It was the first MIDIequipped PC sound card capable of MIDI sound processing 65 and sequencing 66 67 After Roland sold MPU sound chips to other sound card manufacturers 65 it established a universal standard MIDItoPC interface 68 Following the widespread adoption of MIDI computerbased MIDI software sequencers were developed 47 Tracker software In 1987 software sequencers called trackers were developed to realize the lowcost integration of sampling sound and interactive digital sequencer as seen
