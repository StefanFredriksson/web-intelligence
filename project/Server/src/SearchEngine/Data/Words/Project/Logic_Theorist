remove this template message Logic Theorist is a computer program written in 1956 by Allen Newell Herbert A Simon and Cliff Shaw 1 It was the first program deliberately engineered to mimic the problemsolving techniques of a human being and is called the first artificial intelligence program a It would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Whitehead and Russell s Principia Mathematica and find new and more elegant proofs for some 3 Contents 1 History 2 Logic Theorists influence on AI 3 Philosophical implications 4 Notes 5 Citations 6 References 7 External links History edit In 1955 when Newell and Simon began to work on the Logic Theorist the field of artificial intelligence did not yet exist Even the term itself artificial intelligence would not be coined until the following summer b Simon was a political scientist who had already produced classic work in the study of how bureaucracies function as well as developed his theory of bounded rationality for which he would later win a Nobel Prize The study of business organizations requires like artificial intelligence an insight into the nature of human problem solving and decision making Simon remembers consulting at RAND in the early 1950s and seeing a printer typing out a map using ordinary letters and punctuation as symbols He realized that a machine that could manipulate symbols could just as well simulate decision making and possibly even the process of human thought 5 6 The program that printed the map had been written by Newell a RAND Corporation scientist studying logistics and organization theory For Newell the decisive moment was in 1954 when Oliver Selfridge came to RAND to describe his work on pattern matching Watching the presentation Newell suddenly understood how the interaction of simple programmable units could accomplish complex behavior including the intelligent behavior of human beings It all happened in one afternoon he would later say 2 7 It was a rare moment of scientific epiphany I had such a sense of clarity that this was a new path and one I was going to go down I havent had that sensation very many times Im pretty skeptical and so I dont normally go off on a toot but I did on that one Completely absorbed in itwithout existing with the two or three levels consciousness so that youre working and aware that youre working and aware of the consequences and implications the normal mode of thought No Completely absorbed for ten to twelve hours 8 Newell and Simon began to talk about the possibility of teaching machines to think Their first project was a program that could prove mathematical theorems like the ones used in Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead s Principia Mathematica They enlisted the help of computer programmer Cliff Shaw also from RAND to develop the program Newell says Cliff was the genuine computer scientist of the three 9 The first version was handsimulated they wrote the program onto 3x5 cards and as Simon recalled In January 1956 we assembled my wife and three children together with some graduate students To each member of the group we gave one of the cards so that each one became in effect a component of the computer program Here was nature imitating art imitating nature 10 They succeeded in showing that the program could successfully prove theorems as well as a talented mathematician Eventually Shaw was able to run the program on the computer at RAND s Santa Monica facility In the summer of 1956 John McCarthy Marvin Minsky Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester organized a conference on the subject of what they called artificial intelligence a term coined by McCarthy for the occasion Newell and Simon proudly presented the group with the Logic Theorist and were somewhat surprised when the program received a lukewarm reception Pamela McCorduck writes the evidence is that nobody save Newell and Simon themselves sensed the longrange significance of what they were doing 11 Simon confides that we were probably fairly arrogant about it all 12 and adds They didnt want to hear from us and we sure didnt want to hear from them we had something to show them In a way it was ironic because we already had done the first example of what they were after and second they didnt pay much attention to it 13 Logic Theorist soon proved 38 of the first 52 theorems in chapter 2 of the Principia Mathematica The proof of theorem 285 was actually more elegant than the proof produced laboriously by hand by Russell and Whitehead Simon was able to show the new proof to Russell himself who responded with delight 3 They attempted to publish the new proof in The Journal of Symbolic Logic but it was rejected on the grounds that a new proof of an elementary mathematical theorem was not notable apparently overlooking the fact that one of the authors was a computer program 14 3 Newell and Simon formed a lasting partnership founding one of the first AI laboratories at Carnegie Tech and developing a series of influential artificial intelligence programs and ideas including GPS Soar and their unified theory of cognition Logic Theorists influence on AI edit Logic Theorist introduced several concepts that would be central to AI research Reasoning as search Logic Theorist explored a search tree the root was the initial hypothesis each branch was a deduction based on the rules of logic Somewhere in the tree was the goal the proposition the program intended to prove The pathway along the branches that led to the goal was a proof a series of statements each deduced using the rules of logic that led from the hypothesis to the proposition to be proved Heuristics Newell and Simon realized that the search tree would grow exponentially and that they needed to trim some branches using rules of thumb to determine which pathways were unlikely to lead to a solution They called these ad hoc rules heuristics using a term introduced by George Pólya in his classic book on mathematical proof How to Solve It Newell had taken courses from Pólya at Stanford 15 Heuristics would become an important area of research in artificial intelligence and remains an important method to overcome the intractable combinatorial explosion of exponentially growing searches List processing To implement Logic Theorist on a computer the three researchers developed a programming language IPL which used the same form of symbolic list processing that would later form the basis of McCarthys Lisp programming language an important language still used by AI researchers 16 17 Philosophical implications edit Pamela McCorduck writes that the Logic Theorist was proof positive that a machine could perform tasks heretofore considered intelligent creative and uniquely human 3 And as such it represents a milestone in the development of artificial intelligence and our understanding of intelligence in general Simon famously told a graduate class in January 1956 Over Christmas Al Newell and I invented a thinking machine 18 19 and would write We invented a computer program capable of thinking nonnumerically and thereby solved the venerable mindbody problem explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind 20 This statement that machines can have minds just as people do would be later named Strong AI by philosopher John Searle It remains a serious subject of debate up to the present day Pamela McCorduck also sees in the Logic Theorist the debut of a new theory of the mind the information processing model sometimes called computationalism She writes that this view would come to be central to their later work and in their opinion as central to understanding mind in the twentieth century as Darwins principle of natural selection had been to understanding biology in the nineteenth century 21 Newell and Simon would later formalize this proposal as the physical symbol systems hypothesis Notes edit Logic theorist is usually considered the first true AI program although Arthur Samuel s checkers program is earlier Christopher Strachey also wrote a checkers program in 1951 2 The term artificial intelligence was coined by John McCarthy in the proposal for the 1956 Dartmouth Conference The conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science according to Daniel Crevier 4 Citations edit McCorduck 2004 pp123125
