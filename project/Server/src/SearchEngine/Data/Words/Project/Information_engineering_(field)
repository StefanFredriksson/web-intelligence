the engineering discipline that deals with the generation distribution analysis and use of information data and knowledge in systems 1 2 3 4 5 bettersourceneeded The field first became identifiable in the early 21st century citation needed Object detection for a stop sign The components of information engineering include more theoretical fields such as machine learning artificial intelligence control theory signal processing and information theory and more applied fields such as computer vision natural language processing bioinformatics medical image computing cheminformatics autonomous robotics mobile robotics and telecommunications 1 2 5 6 7 Many of these originate from computer science as well as other branches of engineering such as computer engineering electrical engineering and bioengineering An example of clustering in machine learning The field of information engineering is based heavily on mathematics particularly probability statistics calculus linear algebra optimization differential equations variational calculus and complex analysis Information engineers often citation needed hold a degree in information engineering or a related area and are often part of a professional body such as the Institution of Engineering and Technology or Institute of Measurement and Control 8 9 10 They are employed in almost all industries due to the widespread use of information engineering Contents 1 History 2 Elements 21 Machine learning and statistics 22 Control theory 23 Signal processing 24 Information theory 25 Computer vision 26 Natural language processing

is now more commonly known as information technology engineering citation needed or information engineering methodology It began to gain its current meaning early on in the 21st century citation needed Elements edit Machine learning and statistics edit Main article Machine learning Machine learning is the field that involves the use of statistical and probabilistic methods to let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed 11 Data science involves the application of machine learning to extract knowledge from data Subfields of machine learning include deep learning supervised learning unsupervised learning reinforcement learning semisupervised learning and active learning Causal inference is another related component of information engineering Control theory edit Main article Control theory Control theory refers to the control of continuous dynamical systems with the aim being to avoid delays overshoots or instability 12 Information engineers tend to focus more on control theory rather than the physical design of control systems and circuits which tends to fall under electrical engineering Subfields of control theory include classical control optimal control and nonlinear control Signal processing edit Main article Signal processing Signal processing refers to the generation analysis and use of signals which could take many forms such as image sound electrical or biological 13 An example of how the 2D Fourier transform can be used to remove unwanted information from an Xray scan Information theory edit Main article Information theory Information theory studies the analysis transmission and storage of information Major subfields of information theory include coding and data compression 14 Computer vision edit Main article Computer vision Computer vision is the field that deals with getting computers to understand image and video data at a high level 15 Natural language processing edit Main article Natural language processing Natural language processing deals with getting computers to understand human natural languages at a high level This usually means text but also often includes speech processing and recognition 16 Bioinformatics edit Main article Bioinformatics Bioinformatics is the field that deals with the analysis processing and use of biological data 17 This usually means topics such as genomics and proteomics and sometimes also includes medical image computing Cheminformatics edit Main article Cheminformatics Cheminformatics is the field that deals with the analysis processing and use of chemical data 18 Robotics edit Main article Robotics Robotics in information engineering focuses mainly on the algorithms and computer programs used to control robots As such information engineering tends to focus more on autonomous mobile or probabilistic robots 19 20 21 Major subfields studied by information engineers include control perception SLAM and motion planning 19 20 Tools edit In the past some areas in information engineering such as signal processing used analog electronics but nowadays most information engineering is done with digital computers Many tasks in information engineering can be parallelized and so nowadays information engineering is carried out using CPUs GPUs and AI accelerators 22 23 There has also been interest in using quantum computers for some subfields of information engineering such as machine learning and robotics 24 25 26 See also edit Aerospace engineering Chemical engineering Civil engineering Internet of things List of engineering
