edit This was a match between Lee Sedol and Hong Changsik during the 2003 KAT cup played on 23 April 2003 This game is notable for Lees use of a broken ladder formation Normally playing out a broken ladder is a bad mistake a pitfall associated with bad beginner play the chasing stones are left appallingly weak Between experts it should be decisive leading to a lost game Lee playing black defied the conventional wisdom pushing development of the ladder to capture a large group of Hongs stones in the lowerright side of the board Although Black could not capture the stones in the ladder White ultimately resigned 9 Moves 67 to 97 Black Lee Sedol White Hong Changsik Black wins when White resigns at move 211 Match against AlphaGo edit Main article AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol Starting March 9 2016 Lee played a fivegame match broadcast live against the computer program AlphaGo developed by a Londonbased artificial intelligence firm Google DeepMind for a 1 million match prize 10 11 12 He said I have heard that Google DeepMinds AI is surprisingly strong and getting stronger but I am confident that I can win at least this time 13 In an interview with Sohn Sukhee of JTBC Newsroom on February 22 2016 14 he showed confidence in his chances again while saying that even beating AlphaGo by 41 may allow the Google DeepMind team to claim its de facto victory and the defeat of him or even humanity In this interview he pointed out the time rule in this match which seems wellbalanced so that both he and the AI would fairly undergo time pressure In another interview at Yonhap News Lee Sedol said that he was confident of beating AlphaGo by a score of 50 at least 41 and accepted the challenge in only five minutes He also stated Of course there would have been many updates in the last four or five months but that isnt enough time to challenge me 15 On March 9 Lee played black and lost the first game by resignation 16 On March 10 he played white and lost the second game by resignation 17 On March 12 he played black and lost the third game as well 18 On March 13 he played white and won the fourth game following an unexpected move at White 78 described as a brilliant tesuji and by Gu Li 9 dan as a divine move and completely unforeseen by him GoGameGuru commented that this game was a masterpiece for Lee Sedol and will almost certainly become a famous game in the history of Go 19 Lee commented after the victory that he considered AlphaGo was strongest when playing white second For this reason and because he thought winning a second time with black would be more valuable than winning with white he requested that he play black in the final fifth game which is considered more risky when following Chinese go rules 20 On March 15 he played black and lost the fifth game to lose the Go series 14 21 Game 4 Lee Sedol white v AlphaGo black First 78 moves After his fourthmatch victory Lee was overjoyed I dont think Ive ever felt so good after winning just one match I remember when I said I will win all or lose just one game in the beginning If this had really happened I won 3 rounds and lost this round it would have had a great bearing on my reputation However since I won after losing 3 games in a row I am so happy I will never exchange this win for anything in the world 22 He added I Lee Sedol lost but mankind did not 20 After the last match however Lee was saddened I failed I feel sorry that the match is over and it ended like this I wanted it to end well He also confessed that As a professional Go player I never want to play this kind of match again I endured the match because I accepted it 23 Promotion record edit Lee Sedol turned pro in 1995 as 1 dan and reached 9 dan in 2003 24 Rank Date Notes 1 dan 2 July 1995 Promoted to
