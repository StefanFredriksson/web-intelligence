Walter Pitts American logician and computational neuroscientist Walter Pitts Walter Pitts right with Jerome Lettvin coauthor of the cognitive science paper What the Frogs Eye Tells the Frogs Brain 1959 Born Walter Harry Pitts Jr 19230423 23 April 1923 Detroit Michigan United States Died 14 May 1969 19690514 aged46 United States Scientific career Fields Logician Walter Harry Pitts Jr 23 April 1923 14 May 1969 was a logician who worked in the field of computational neuroscience 1 He proposed landmark theoretical formulations of neural activity and generative processes that influenced diverse fields such as cognitive sciences and psychology philosophy neurosciences computer science artificial neural networks cybernetics and artificial intelligence together with what has come to be known as the generative sciences He is best remembered for having written along with Warren McCulloch a seminal paper in scientific history titled A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity 1943 This paper proposed the first mathematical model of a neural network The unit of this model a simple formalized neuron is still the standard of reference in the field of neural networks It is often called a McCullochPitts neuron Prior to that paper he formalized his ideas regarding the fundamental steps to building a Turing machine in the The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics in an essay titled Some observations on the simple neuron circuit Contents 1 Early life 2 Academic career 3 Personal Life Emotional trauma and decline 4 Publications 5 See also 6 References 7 Further

and was able to read several languages including Greek and Latin He is widely remembered for having spent three days in a library at the age of 12 reading Principia Mathematica and sent a letter to Bertrand Russell pointing out what he considered serious problems with the first half of the first volume Russell was appreciative and invited him to study in the United Kingdom Although Bertrand Russell invited him to Cambridge University at age 12 the offer was not taken up however Pitts did decide to become a logician Academic career edit Pitts probably continued to correspond with Bertrand Russell and at the age of 15 he attended Russells lectures at the University of Chicago 1 2 He stayed there without registering as a student While there in 1938 he met Jerome Lettvin a premedical student and the two became close friends 3 Russell was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in the fall of 1938 and he directed Pitts to study with the logician Rudolf Carnap 3 Pitts met Carnap at Chicago by walking into his office during office hours and presenting him with an annotated version of Carnaps recent book on logic The Logical Syntax of Language 4 Since Pitts did not introduce himself Carnap spent months searching for him and when he found him he obtained for him a menial job at the university and had Pitts study with him Pitts at the time was homeless and without income 5 He mastered Carnaps abstract logic then met with and was intrigued by the work of the Ukrainian mathematical physicist Nicolas Rashevsky who was also at Chicago and was the founder of mathematical biophysics remodeling biology on the structure of the physical sciences and mathematical logic 6 Pitts also worked closely with the mathematician Alston Scott Householder who was a member of Rashevskys group 7 8 9 Later Warren McCulloch also arrived at the University of Chicago and in early 1942 invited Pitts who was still homeless together with Lettvin to live with his family In the evenings McCulloch and Pitts collaborated Pitts was familiar with the work of Gottfried Leibniz on computing and they considered the question of whether the nervous system could be considered a kind of universal computing device as described by Leibniz This led to their seminal neural networks paper A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity After five years of unofficial studies the University of Chicago awarded Pitts an Associate of Arts his only earned degree for his work on the paper 10 In 1943 Lettvin introduced Pitts to Norbert Wiener at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Their first meeting where they discussed Wieners proof of the ergodic theorem went so well that Pitts moved to Greater Boston to work with Wiener While Pitts was an unofficial student under the aegis of Wiener at MIT until their acrimonious parting in 1952 he formally enrolled as a graduate student in the physics department during the 19431944 academic year and in the electrical engineering computer science department from 19561958 10 11 In 1944 Pitts was hired by Kellex Corporation later acquired in 1950 by Vitro Corporation in New York City part of the Atomic Energy Project 12 From 1946 Pitts was a core member and involved with the Macy conferences whose principal purpose was to set the foundations for a general science of the workings of the human mind Personal Life Emotional trauma and decline edit In 1951 Wiener convinced Jerome Wiesner to hire some physiologists of the nervous system A group was established with Pitts Lettvin McCulloch and Pat Wall Pitts wrote a large dissertation on the properties of neural nets connected in three dimensions Lettvin described him as in no uncertain sense the genius of the group when you asked him a question you would get back a whole textbook Pitts never married 1 Pitts was also described as an eccentric refusing to allow his name to be made publicly available He continued to refuse all offers of advanced degrees or positions of authority at MIT in part as he would have to sign his name In 1952 Wiener suddenly turned against McCullochhis wife Margaret Wiener hated McCulloch 13 and broke off relations with anyone connected to him including Pitts 13 Although he remained employed as a research associate in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT as little more than a technicality 14 for the rest of his life Pitts became increasingly socially isolated In 1959 the paradigmatic What the Frogs Eye Tells the Frogs Brain credited to Humberto Maturana Lettvin McCulloch and Pitts conclusively demonstrated that analog processes in the eye were doing at least part of the interpretive work in image processing as opposed to the brain computing information digital neuron by digital neuron using the exacting implement of mathematical logic leading Pitts to burn his unpublished doctoral dissertation on probabilistic three dimensional neural networks and years of unpublished research He took little further interest in work excepting only a collaboration with Lettvin and Robert Gesteland which produced a paper on olfaction in 1965 Pitts died in 1969 of bleeding esophageal varices a condition usually associated with cirrhosis and alcoholism 1 2 13 Publications edit Walter Pitts Some observations on the simple neuron circuit Bulletin of Mathematical Biology Volume 4 Number 3 121129 1942 Warren

2016 There was just one person who wasnt happy about the reunion Wieners wife Margaret Wiener was by all accounts a controlling conservative prudeand she despised McCullochs influence on her husband McCulloch hosted wild gettogethers at his family farm in Old Lyme Connecticut where ideas roamed free and everyone went skinnydipping It had been one thing when McCulloch was in Chicago but now he was coming to Cambridge and Margaret wouldnt have it And so she invented a story She sat Wiener down and informed him that when their daughter Barbara had stayed at McCullochs house in Chicago several of his boys had seduced her Wiener immediately sent an angry telegram to Wiesner Please inform Pitts and Lettvin that all connection between me and your projects is permanently abolished They are your problem Wiener He never spoke to Pitts again Gefter Amanda 5 February 2015 The Man Who Tried to Redeem the World with Logic Nautilus Further reading edit Aizawa Kenneth Connectionism and artificial
