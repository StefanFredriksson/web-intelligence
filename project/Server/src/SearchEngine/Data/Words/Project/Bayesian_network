graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model a type of statistical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph DAG Bayesian networks are ideal for taking an event that occurred and predicting the likelihood that any one of several possible known causes was the contributing factor For example a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms Given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases Efficient algorithms can perform

Bayesian sense they may be observable quantities latent variables unknown parameters or hypotheses Edges represent conditional dependencies nodes that are not connected no path connects one node to another represent variables that are conditionally independent of each other Each node is associated with a probability function that takes as input a particular set of values for the nodes parent variables and gives as output the probability or probability distribution if applicable of the variable represented by the node For example if m displaystyle m parent nodes represent m displaystyle m Boolean variables then the probability function could be represented by a table of 2 m displaystyle 2m entries one entry for each of the 2 m displaystyle 2m possible parent combinations Similar ideas may be applied to undirected and possibly cyclic graphs such as Markov networks Example edit A simple Bayesian network with conditional probability tables Two events can cause grass to be wet an active sprinkler or rain Rain has a direct effect on the use of the sprinkler namely that when it rains the sprinkler usually is not active This situation can be modeled with a Bayesian network shown

that ends with an arrow into X Sets that satisfy the backdoor criterion are called sufficient or admissible For example the set Z R is admissible for predicting the effect of S T on G because R d separates the only backdoor path S R G However if S is not observed no other set d separates this path and the effect of turning the sprinkler on S T on the grass G cannot be predicted from passive observations In that case P G do S T is not identified This reflects the fact that lacking interventional data the observed dependence between S and G is due to a causal connection or is spuriousapparent dependence arising from a common cause R see Simpsons paradox To determine whether a causal relation is identified from an arbitrary Bayesian network with unobserved variables one can use the three rules of do calculus 1 4 and test whether all do terms can be removed from the expression of that relation thus confirming that the desired quantity is estimable from frequency data 5 Using a Bayesian network can save considerable amounts of memory over exhaustive probability tables if the dependencies in the joint distribution are sparse For example a naive way of storing the conditional probabilities of 10 twovalued variables as a table requires storage space for 2 10 1024 displaystyle 2101024 values If no variables local distribution depends on more than three parent variables the Bayesian network representation stores at most 10 2 3 80 displaystyle 10cdot 2380 values One advantage of Bayesian networks is that it is intuitively easier for a human to understand a sparse set of direct dependencies and local distributions than complete joint distributions Inference and learning edit Bayesian networks perform three main inference tasks Inferring unobserved variables edit Because a Bayesian network is a complete model for its variables and their relationships it can be used to answer probabilistic queries about them For example the network can be used to update knowledge of the state of a subset of variables when other variables the evidence variables are observed This process of computing the posterior distribution of variables given evidence is called probabilistic inference The posterior gives a universal sufficient statistic for detection applications when choosing values for the variable subset that minimize some expected loss function for instance the probability of decision error A Bayesian network can thus be considered a mechanism for automatically applying Bayes theorem to complex problems The most common exact inference methods are variable elimination which eliminates by integration or summation the nonobserved nonquery variables one by one by distributing the sum over the product clique tree propagation which caches the computation so that many variables can be queried at one time and new evidence can be propagated quickly and recursive conditioning and ANDOR search which allow for a spacetime tradeoff and match the efficiency of variable elimination when enough space is used All of these methods have complexity that is exponential in the networks treewidth The most common approximate inference algorithms are importance sampling stochastic MCMC simulation minibucket elimination loopy belief propagation generalized belief propagation and variational methods Parameter learning edit In order to fully specify the Bayesian network and thus fully represent the joint probability distribution it is necessary to specify for each node X the probability distribution for X conditional upon X s parents The distribution of X conditional upon its parents may have any form It is common to work with discrete or Gaussian distributions since that simplifies calculations Sometimes only constraints on a distribution are known one can then use the principle of maximum entropy to determine a single distribution the one with the greatest entropy given the constraints Analogously in the specific context of a dynamic Bayesian network the conditional distribution for the hidden states temporal evolution is commonly specified to maximize the entropy rate of the implied stochastic process Often these conditional distributions include parameters that are unknown and must be estimated from data eg via the maximum likelihood approach Direct maximization of the likelihood or of the posterior probability is often complex given unobserved variables A classical approach to this problem is the expectationmaximization algorithm which alternates computing expected values of the unobserved variables conditional on observed data with maximizing the complete likelihood or posterior assuming that previously computed expected values are correct Under mild regularity conditions this process converges on maximum likelihood or maximum posterior values for parameters A more fully Bayesian approach to parameters is to treat them as additional unobserved variables and to compute a full posterior distribution over all nodes conditional upon observed data then to integrate out the parameters This approach can be expensive and lead to large dimension models making classical parametersetting approaches more tractable Structure learning edit In the simplest case a Bayesian network is specified by an expert and is then used to perform inference In other applications the task of defining the network is too complex for humans In this case the network structure and the parameters of the local distributions must be learned from data Automatically learning the graph structure of a Bayesian network BN is a challenge pursued within machine learning The basic idea goes back to a recovery algorithm developed by Rebane and Pearl 6 and rests on the distinction between the three possible patterns allowed in a 3node DAG Junction patterns Pattern Model Chain X Y Z displaystyle Xrightarrow Yrightarrow Z Fork X Y Z displaystyle Xleftarrow Yrightarrow Z Collider X Y Z displaystyle Xrightarrow Yleftarrow Z The first 2 represent the same dependencies X displaystyle X and Z displaystyle Z are independent given Y displaystyle Y and are therefore indistinguishable The collider however can be uniquely identified since X displaystyle X and Z displaystyle Z are marginally independent and all other pairs are dependent Thus while the skeletons the graphs stripped of arrows of these three triplets are identical the directionality of the arrows is partially identifiable The same distinction applies when X displaystyle X and Z displaystyle Z have common parents except that one must first condition on those parents Algorithms have been developed to systematically determine the skeleton of the underlying graph and then orient all arrows whose directionality is dictated by the conditional independences observed 1 7 8 9 An alternative method of structural learning uses optimizationbased search It requires a scoring function and a search strategy A common scoring function is posterior probability of the structure given the training data like the BIC or the BDeu The time requirement of an exhaustive search returning a structure that maximizes the score is superexponential in the number of variables A local search strategy makes incremental changes aimed at improving the score of the structure A global search algorithm like Markov chain Monte Carlo can avoid getting trapped in local minima Friedman et al 10 11 discuss using mutual information between variables and finding a structure that maximizes this They do this by restricting the parent candidate set to k nodes and exhaustively searching therein A particularly fast method for exact BN learning is to cast the problem as an optimization problem and solve it using integer programming Acyclicity constraints are added to the integer program IP during solving in the form of cutting planes 12 Such method can handle problems with up to 100 variables In order to deal with problems with thousands of variables a different approach is necessary One is to first sample one ordering and then find the optimal BN structure with respect to that ordering This implies working on the search space of the possible orderings which is convenient as it is smaller than the space of network structures Multiple orderings are then sampled and evaluated This method has been proven to be the best available in literature when the number of variables is huge 13 Another method consists of focusing on the subclass of decomposable models for which the MLE have a closed form It is then possible to discover a consistent structure for hundreds of variables 14 Learning Bayesian networks with bounded treewidth is necessary to allow exact tractable inference since the worstcase inference complexity is exponential in the treewidth k under the exponential time hypothesis Yet as a global property of the graph it considerably increases the difficulty of the learning process In this context it is possible to use Ktree for effective learning 15 Statistical introduction edit Main article Bayesian statistics Given data x displaystyle x and parameter θ displaystyle theta a simple Bayesian analysis starts with a prior probability prior p θ displaystyle ptheta and likelihood p x θ displaystyle pxmid theta to compute a posterior probability p θ x p x θ p θ displaystyle ptheta mid xpropto pxmid theta ptheta Often the prior on θ displaystyle theta depends in turn on other parameters φ displaystyle varphi that are not mentioned in the likelihood So the prior p θ displaystyle ptheta must be replaced by a likelihood p θ φ displaystyle ptheta mid varphi and a prior p φ displaystyle pvarphi on the newly introduced parameters φ displaystyle varphi is required resulting in a posterior probability p θ φ x p x θ p θ φ p φ displaystyle ptheta varphi mid xpropto pxmid theta ptheta mid varphi pvarphi This is the simplest example of a hierarchical Bayes model clarification needed The process may be repeated for example the parameters φ displaystyle varphi may depend in turn on additional parameters ψ displaystyle psi which require their own prior Eventually the process must terminate with priors that do not depend on unmentioned parameters Introductory examples edit This section needs expansion You can help by adding to it March 2009 Given the measured quantities x 1 x n displaystyle x1dots xn each with normally distributed errors of known standard deviation σ displaystyle sigma x i N θ i σ 2 displaystyle xisim Ntheta isigma 2 Suppose we are interested in estimating the θ i displaystyle theta i An approach would be to estimate the θ i displaystyle theta i using a maximum likelihood approach since the observations are independent the likelihood factorizes and the maximum likelihood estimate is simply θ i x i displaystyle theta ixi However if the quantities are related so that for example the individual θ i displaystyle theta i have themselves been drawn from an underlying distribution then this relationship destroys the independence and suggests a more complex model eg x i N θ i σ 2 displaystyle xisim Ntheta isigma 2 θ i N φ τ 2 displaystyle theta isim Nvarphi tau 2 with improper priors φ displaystyle varphi sim flat τ displaystyle tau sim flat 0 displaystyle in 0infty When n 3 displaystyle ngeq 3 this is an identified model ie there exists a unique solution for the models parameters and the posterior distributions of the individual θ i displaystyle theta i will tend to move or shrink away from the maximum likelihood estimates towards their common mean This shrinkage is a typical behavior in hierarchical Bayes models Restrictions on priors edit Some care is needed when choosing priors in a hierarchical model particularly on scale variables at higher levels of the hierarchy such as the variable τ displaystyle tau in the example The usual priors such as the Jeffreys prior often do not work because the posterior distribution will not be normalizable and estimates made by minimizing the expected loss will be inadmissible Definitions and concepts edit See also Glossary of graph theory Directed acyclic graphs Several equivalent definitions of a Bayesian network have been offered For the following let G V E be a directed acyclic graph DAG and let X X v v V be a set of random variables indexed by V Factorization definition edit X is a Bayesian network with respect to G if its joint probability density function with respect to a product measure can be written as a product of the individual density functions conditional on their parent variables 16 p x v V p x v x pa v displaystyle pxprod vin Vpleftxvbig xoperatorname pa vright where pa v is the set of parents of v ie those vertices pointing directly to v via a single edge For any set of random variables the probability of any member of a joint distribution can be calculated from conditional probabilities using the chain rule given a topological ordering of X as follows 16 P X 1 x 1 X n x n v 1 n P X v x v X v 1 x v 1 X n x n displaystyle operatorname P X1x1ldots Xnxnprod v1noperatorname P leftXvxvmid Xv1xv1ldots Xnxnright Using the definition above this can be written as P X 1 x 1 X n x n v 1 n P X v x v X j x j for each X j that is a parent of X v displaystyle operatorname P X1x1ldots Xnxnprod v1noperatorname P Xvxvmid Xjxjtext for each Xjtext that is a parent of Xv The difference between the two expressions is the conditional independence of the variables from any of their nondescendants given the values of their parent variables Local Markov property edit X is a Bayesian network with respect to G if it satisfies the local Markov property each variable is conditionally independent of its nondescendants given its parent variables 17 X v X V de v X pa v for all v V displaystyle Xvperp perp XVsmallsetminus operatorname de vmid Xoperatorname pa vquad textfor all vin V where de v is the set of descendants and V de v is the set of nondescendants of v This can be expressed in terms similar to the first definition as P X v x v X i x i for each X i that is not a descendant of X v P X v x v X j x j for each X j that is a parent of X v displaystyle beginalignedoperatorname P Xvxvmid Xixitext for each Xitext that is not a descendant of Xv6ptPXvxvmid Xjxjtext for each Xjtext that is a parent of Xvendaligned The set of parents is a subset of the set of nondescendants because the graph is acyclic Developing Bayesian networks edit Developing a Bayesian network often begins with creating a DAG G such that X satisfies the local Markov property with respect to G Sometimes this is a causal DAG The conditional probability distributions of each variable given its parents in G are assessed In many cases in particular in the case where the variables are discrete if the joint distribution of X is the product of these conditional distributions then X is a Bayesian network with respect to G 18 Markov blanket edit The Markov blanket of a node is the set of nodes consisting of its parents its children and any other parents of its children The Markov blanket renders the node independent of the rest of the network the joint distribution of the variables in the Markov blanket of a node is sufficient knowledge for calculating the distribution of the node X is a Bayesian network with respect to G if every node is conditionally independent of all other nodes in the network given its Markov blanket 17 d separation edit This definition can be made more general by defining the dseparation of two nodes where d stands for directional 19 20 We first define the dseparation of a trail and then we will define the dseparation of two nodes in terms of that Let P be a trail from node u to v A trail is a loopfree undirected ie all edge directions are ignored path between two nodes Then P is said to be d separated by a set of nodes Z if any of the following conditions holds P contains but does not need to be entirely a directed chain u m v displaystyle ucdots leftarrow mleftarrow cdots v or u m v displaystyle ucdots rightarrow mrightarrow cdots v such that the middle node m is in Z P contains a fork u m v displaystyle ucdots leftarrow mrightarrow cdots v such that the middle node m is in Z or P contains an inverted fork or collider u m v displaystyle ucdots rightarrow mleftarrow cdots v such that the middle node m is not in Z and no descendant of m is in Z The nodes u and v are d separated by Z if all trails between them are d separated If u and v are not dseparated they are dconnected X is a Bayesian network with respect to G if for any two nodes u v X u X v X Z displaystyle Xuperp perp Xvmid XZ where Z is a set which d separates u and v The Markov blanket is the minimal set of nodes which d separates node v from all other nodes Causal networks edit Although Bayesian networks are often used to represent causal relationships this need not be the case a directed edge from u to v does not require that X v be causally dependent on X u This is demonstrated by the fact that Bayesian networks on the graphs a b c and a b c displaystyle arightarrow brightarrow cqquad textandqquad aleftarrow bleftarrow c are equivalent that is they impose exactly the same conditional independence requirements A causal network is a Bayesian network with the requirement that the relationships be causal The additional semantics of causal networks specify that if a node X is actively caused to be in a given state x an action written as do X x then the probability density function changes to that of the network obtained by cutting the links from the parents of X to X and setting X to the caused value x 1 Using these semantics the impact of external interventions from data obtained prior to intervention can be predicted Inference complexity and approximation algorithms edit In 1990 while working at Stanford University on large bioinformatic applications Cooper proved that exact inference in Bayesian networks is NPhard 21 This result prompted research on approximation algorithms with the aim of developing a tractable approximation to probabilistic inference In 1993 Dagum and Luby proved two surprising results on the complexity of approximation of probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks 22 First they proved that no tractable deterministic algorithm can approximate probabilistic inference to within an absolute error ɛ 12 Second they proved that no tractable randomized algorithm can approximate probabilistic inference to within an absolute error ɛ 12 with confidence probability greater than 12 At about the same time Roth proved that exact inference in Bayesian networks is in fact Pcomplete and thus as hard as counting the number of satisfying assignments of a conjunctive normal form formula CNF and that approximate inference within a factor 2 n 1ɛ for every ɛ 0 even for Bayesian networks with restricted architecture is NPhard 23 24 In practical terms these complexity results suggested that while Bayesian networks were rich representations for AI and machine learning applications their use in large realworld applications would need to be tempered by either topological structural constraints such as naïve Bayes networks or by restrictions on the conditional probabilities The bounded variance algorithm 25 was the first provable fast approximation algorithm to efficiently approximate probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks with guarantees on the error approximation This powerful algorithm required the minor restriction on the conditional probabilities of the Bayesian network to be bounded away from zero and one by 1 p n where p n was any polynomial on the number of nodes in the network n Software edit Notable
