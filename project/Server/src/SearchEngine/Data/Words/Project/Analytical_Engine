mechanical generalpurpose computer designed by English mathematician and computer pioneer Charles Babbage 2 3 It was first described in 1837 as the successor to Babbages difference engine check spelling a design for a simpler mechanical computer 4 The Analytical Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops and integrated memory making it the first design for a generalpurpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turingcomplete 5 6 In other words the logical structure of the Analytical Engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era 3 The Analytical Engine is one of the most successful achievements of Charles Babbage Babbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding 7 8 It was not until 1941 that the first generalpurpose computer Z3 was actually built more than a century after Babbage had proposed the pioneering Analytical Engine in 1837 3 Contents 1 Design 2 Construction 3 Instruction set 4 Influence 41 Predicted influence 42 Computer science 5 Comparison to

instructions background variable cards for inputting data Babbages first attempt at a mechanical computing device the Difference Engine was a specialpurpose machine designed to tabulate logarithms and trigonometric functions by evaluating finite differences to create approximating polynomials Construction of this machine was never completed Babbage had conflicts with his chief engineer Joseph Clement and ultimately the British government withdrew its funding for the project 9 10 11 During this project he realised that a much more general design the Analytical Engine was possible 9 The work on the design of the Analytical Engine started in c 1833 12 4 The input consisting of programs formulae and data 13 9 was to be provided to the machine via punched cards a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom 14 For output the machine would have a printer a curve plotter and a bell 9 The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later It employed ordinary base10 fixedpoint arithmetic 9 There was to be a store that is a memory capable of holding 1000 numbers of 40 decimal digits 15 each ca 162 kB An arithmetic unit the mill would be able to perform all four arithmetic operations plus comparisons and optionally square roots 16 Initially 1838 it was conceived as a difference engine curved back upon itself in a generally circular layout with the long store exiting off to one side 17 Later drawings 1858 depict a regularised grid layout 18 Like the central processing unit CPU in a modern computer the mill would rely upon its own internal procedures to be stored in the form of pegs inserted into rotating drums called barrels to carry out some of the more complex instructions the users program might specify 7 The programming language to be employed by users was akin to modern day assembly languages Loops and conditional branching were possible and so the language as conceived would have been Turingcomplete as later defined by Alan Turing Three different types of punch cards were used one for arithmetical operations one for numerical constants and one for load and store operations transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back There were three separate readers for the three types of cards Babbage developed some two dozen programs for the Analytical Engine between 1837 and 1840 and one program later 14 19 These programs treat polynomials iterative formulas Gaussian elimination and Bernoulli numbers 14 20 In 1842 the Italian mathematician Luigi Federico Menabrea published a description of the engine based on a lecture by Babbage in French In 1843 the description was translated into English and extensively annotated by Ada Lovelace who had become interested in the engine eight years earlier In recognition of her additions to Menabreas paper which included a way to calculate Bernoulli numbers using the machine widely considered to be the first complete computer program she has been described as the first computer programmer Construction edit Henry Babbages Analytical Engine Mill built in 1910 21 in the Science Museum London Late in his life Babbage sought ways to build a simplified version of the machine and assembled a small part of it before his death in 1871 7 1 22 In 1878 a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science described the Analytical Engine as a marvel of mechanical ingenuity but recommended against constructing it The committee acknowledged the usefulness and value of the machine but could not estimate the cost of building it and were unsure whether the machine would function correctly after being built 23 24 Intermittently from 1880 to 1910 25 Babbages son Henry Prevost Babbage was constructing a part of the mill and the printing apparatus In 1910 it was able to calculate a faulty list of multiples of pi 26 This constituted only a small part of the whole engine it was not programmable and had no storage Popular images of this section have sometimes been mislabelled implying that it was the entire mill or even the entire engine Henry Babbages Analytical Engine Mill is on display at the Science Museum in London 21 Henry also proposed building a demonstration version of the full engine with a smaller storage capacity perhaps for a first machine ten columns would do with fifteen wheels in each 27 Such a version could manipulate 20numbers of 25digits each and what it could be told to do with those numbers could still be impressive It is only a question of cards and time wrote Henry Babbage in 1888 and there is no reason why twenty thousand cards should not be used if necessary in an Analytical Engine for the purposes of the mathematician 27 In 1991 the London Science Museum built a complete and working specimen of Babbages Difference Engine No 2 a design that incorporated refinements Babbage discovered during the development of the Analytical Engine 5 This machine was built using materials and engineering tolerances that would have been available to Babbage quelling the suggestion that Babbages designs could not have been produced using the manufacturing technology of his time 28 In October 2010 John GrahamCumming started a Plan 28 campaign to raise funds by public subscription to enable serious historical and academic study of Babbages plans with a view to then build and test a fully working virtual design which will then in turn enable construction of the physical Analytical Engine 29 30 As of May 2016 actual construction had not been attempted since no consistent understanding could yet be obtained from Babbages original design drawings In particular it was unclear whether it could handle the indexed variables which were required for Lovelaces Bernoulli program 31 By 2017 the Plan 28 effort reported that a searchable database of all catalogued material was available and an initial review of Babbages voluminous Scribbling Books had been completed 32 Instruction set edit Plan diagram of the Analytical Engine from 1840 Babbage is not known to have written down an explicit set of instructions for the engine in the manner of a modern processor manual Instead he showed his programs as lists of states during their execution showing what operator was run at each step with little indication of how the control flow would be guided Allan G Bromley has assumed that the card deck could be read in forwards and backwards directions as a function of conditional branching after testing for conditions which would make the engine Turingcomplete the cards could be ordered to move forward and reverse and hence to loop 14 The introduction for the first time in 1845 of user operations for a variety of service functions including most importantly an effective system for user control of looping in user programsThere is no indication how the direction of turning of the operation and variable cards is specified In the absence of other evidence I have had to adopt the minimal default assumption that both the operation and variable cards can only be turned backward as is necessary to implement the loops used in Babbages sample programs There would be no mechanical or microprogramming difficulty in placing the direction of motion under the control of the user 33 In their emulator of the engine Fourmilab say The Engines Card Reader is not constrained to simply process the cards in a chain one after another from start to finish It can in addition directed by the very cards it reads and advised by the whether the Mills runup lever is activated either advance the card chain forward skipping the intervening cards or backward causing previouslyread cards to be processed once again This emulator does provide a written symbolic instruction set though this has been constructed by its authors rather than based on Babbages original works For example a factorial program would be written as N0 6N1 1N2 1L1L0S1L0L2S0L2L0CB11 where the CB is the conditional branch instruction or combination card used to make the control flow jump in this case backwards by 11 cards Influence edit Predicted influence edit Babbage understood that the existence of an automatic computer would kindle interest in the field now known as algorithmic efficiency writing in his Passages from the Life of a Philosopher As soon as an Analytical Engine exists it will necessarily guide the future course of the science Whenever any result is sought by its aid the question will then ariseBy what course of calculation can these results be arrived at by the machine in the shortest time 34 Computer science edit From 1872 Henry continued diligently with his fathers work and then intermittently in retirement in 1875 35 Percy Ludgate wrote about the engine in 1914 36 and published his own design for an Analytical Engine in 1908 37 38 It was drawn up in detail but never built and the drawings have never been found Ludgates engine would be much smaller about 8 cubic feet 230 L than Babbages and hypothetically would be capable of multiplying two 20decimaldigit numbers in about six seconds 39 Torres y Quevedo wrote about Babbages engines in Essays on Automatics 1913 Book contains design for an electromechanical machine capable of calculating completely automatically the value of a function 39 Vannevar Bush s paper Instrumental Analysis 1936 included several references to Babbages work In the same year started Rapid Arithmetical Machine project to investigate the problems of constructing an electronic digital computer 39 Despite this groundwork Babbages work fell into historical obscurity and the Analytical Engine was unknown to builders of electromechanical and electronic computing machines in the 1930s and 1940s when they began their work resulting in the need to reinvent many of the architectural innovations Babbage had proposed Howard Aiken who built the quicklyobsoleted electromechanical calculator the Harvard Mark I between 1937 and 1945 praised Babbages work likely as a way of enhancing his own stature but knew nothing of the Analytical Engines architecture during the construction of the Mark I and considered his visit to the constructed portion of the Analytical Engine the greatest disappointment of my life 40 The Mark I showed no influence from the Analytical Engine and lacked the Analytical Engines most prescient architectural feature conditional branching 40 J Presper Eckert and John W Mauchly similarly were not aware of the details of Babbages Analytical Engine work prior to the completion of their design for the first electronic generalpurpose computer the ENIAC 41 42 Comparison to other early computers edit If the Analytical Engine had been built it would have been digital programmable and Turingcomplete It would however have been very slow Luigi Federico Menabrea reported in Sketch of the Analytical Engine Mr Babbage believes he can by his engine form the product of two numbers each containing twenty figures in three minutes 43 By comparison the Harvard Mark I could perform the same task in just six seconds A modern PC can do the same thing in well under a billionth of a second Further information History of computing hardware Early digital computer characteristics Name First operational Numeral system Computing mechanism

In popular culture edit This article may contain minor trivial or unrelated fictional references Trivia or references unimportant to the overall plot of a work of fiction should be edited to explain their importance or deleted August 2012 The cyberpunk novelists William Gibson and Bruce Sterling coauthored a steampunk novel of alternative history titled The Difference Engine in which Babbages Difference and Analytical Engines became available to Victorian society The novel explores the consequences and implications of the early introduction of computational technology There is also mention of the Analytical Engine or the Clockwork Ouroboros as it is also known there in The Book of the War a Faction Paradox anthology edited by Lawrence Miles This machine was used to calculate a way into the Eleven Day Empire Its use resulted in the destruction of the original Houses of Parliament In the novel Perdido Street Station by British author China Miéville engines similar to Babbages serve as brains for the robotic constructs of the city of New Crobuzon One such engine even develops sentient thought due to a recursive algorithmic loop The British Empire of The Peshawar Lancers by S M Stirling features a massive waterpowered analytical engine at Oxford used by two of the main characters It is noted that most of the engines run on steam and that an even larger one is under construction at the British Capital in Delhi In the Michael Flynn novel In the Country of the Blind a secret society calling itself the Babbage Society secretly financed the building of Babbage Engines in the mid19th century In the novel the Society uses the Babbage engines along with a statistical science called Cliology to predict and manipulate future history In the process they predict the rise of the Nazis and accidentally start the US Civil War In the Neal Stephenson novel The Diamond Age ubiquitous molecular nanotechnology is described to make use of rod logic similar to that imagined by Babbages design for the Analytical Engine Moriarty by Modem a short story by Jack Nimersheim describes an alternate history where Babbages Analytical Engine was indeed completed and had been deemed highly classified by the British government The characters of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty had in reality been a set of prototype programs written for the Analytical Engine This short story follows Holmes as his program is implemented on modern computers and he is forced to compete against his nemesis yet again in the modern counterparts of Babbages Analytical Engine 47 A similar setting is used by Sydney Padua in the webcomic The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage 48 49 It features an alternate history where Ada Lovelace and Babbage have built the Analytical Engine and use it to fight crime at Queen Victoria s request 50 The comic is based on thorough research on the biographies of and correspondence between Babbage and Lovelace which is then twisted for humorous effect Georgia on My Mind is a novelette by Charles Sheffield which involves two major themes being widowed and the quest for a legendary Babbage computer Hugh Cook s fantasy novels The Wishstone and the Wonderworkers and The Wazir and the Witch feature an Analytical Engine created by the scientist Ivan Petrov It is used to calculate income tax The Orions Arm online project features the Machina Babbagenseii fully sentient Babbage inspired mechanical computers Each is the size of a large asteroid only capable surviving in microgravity conditions and processes data at 05 the speed of a human brain 51 The flying ships in the anime Last Exile are seen to have analytical engines inside of them Although some have more advanced technology the common ships use analytical engines and even some of the advanced ships are seen to have clockwork mechanisms as well A working version of the Analytical Engine created by fictional inventor Ernest Harding and based on the Babbage concept
