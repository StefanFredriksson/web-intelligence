Program machine A program is a set of instructions used to control the behavior of a machine software Examples of programs include The sequence of cards used by a Jacquard loom to produce a given pattern within weaved cloth Invented in 1801 it used holes in punched cards to represent sewing loom arm movements in order to generate decorative patterns automatically A computer program list of instructions to be executed by a computer Barrels punched cards and music rolls encoding music to be played by player pianos fairground organs barrel organs and music boxes A music sequencer is a programmable musical instrument It was the earliest type of programmable machine The first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers described in their Book of Ingenious Devices in the 9th century 1 2 In 1206 the Arab inventor AlJazari in the Turkish Artuqid Sultnate invented programmable automata which incorporated the first programmable drum machine 3 The execution of a program is a series of actions following the instructions it contains Each instruction produces effects that alter the state of the machine according to its predefined meaning While some machines are called programmable for example a programmable thermostat or a musical synthesizer they are in fact just devices which allow their users to select among a fixed set of a variety of options rather than being controlled by programs written in a language be it textual visual or otherwise References edit Koetsier Teun 2001 On the prehistory of programmable machines musical automata looms calculators Mechanism and Machine Theory Elsevier 36 5 589603 doi 101016S0094114X01000052 mwparseroutput citecitationfontstyleinheritmwparseroutput citation qquotesmwparseroutput citation cs1lockfree abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb665Lockgreensvg9pxLockgreensvgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput citation cs1locklimited amwparseroutput citation cs1lockregistration abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbdd6Lockgrayalt2svg9pxLockgrayalt2svgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput citation cs1locksubscription abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbaaaLockredalt2svg9pxLockredalt2svgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput cs1subscriptionmwparseroutput cs1registrationcolor555mwparseroutput cs1subscription spanmwparseroutput cs1registration spanborderbottom1px dottedcursorhelpmwparseroutput cs1wsicon abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb44cWikisourcelogosvg12pxWikisourcelogosvgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput codecs1codecolorinheritbackgroundinheritborderinheritpaddinginheritmwparseroutput cs1hiddenerrordisplaynonefontsize100mwparseroutput cs1visibleerrorfontsize100mwparseroutput cs1maintdisplaynonecolor33aa33marginleft03emmwparseroutput cs1subscriptionmwparseroutput cs1registrationmwparseroutput cs1formatfontsize95mwparseroutput cs1kernleftmwparseroutput cs1kernwlleftpaddingleft02emmwparseroutput cs1kernrightmwparseroutput cs1kernwlrightpaddingright02em Kapur Ajay Carnegie Dale Murphy Jim Long Jason 2017 Loudspeakers Optional A history of nonloudspeakerbased electroacoustic music Organised Sound Cambridge University Press 22 2 195205 doi 101017S1355771817000103 ISSN 13557718 Professor Noel Sharkey A 13th Century Programmable Robot Archive University of Sheffield 2007 This computing article is a stub You can help Wikipedia by expanding it v t e
