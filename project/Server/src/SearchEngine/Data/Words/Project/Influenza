flu Influenza virus magnified approximately 100000 times Specialty Infectious disease Symptoms Fever runny nose sore throat muscle and joint pain headache coughing feeling tired 1 Usual onset One to four days after exposure 1 Duration 1 week 1 Causes Influenza viruses 2 Prevention Hand washing influenza vaccine surgical masks 1 3 Medication Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir 1 Frequency 35 million severe cases per year 1 Deaths Up to 650000 respiratory deaths per year 4 1 Influenza commonly known as the flu is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus 1 Symptoms can be mild to severe 5 The most common symptoms include high fever runny nose sore throat muscle and joint pain headache coughing and feeling tired 1 These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week 1 The cough however may last for more than two weeks 1 In children there may be diarrhea and vomiting but these are not common in adults 6 Diarrhea and vomiting occur more commonly in gastroenteritis which is an unrelated disease and sometimes inaccurately referred to as stomach flu or the 24hour flu 6 Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia secondary bacterial pneumonia sinus infections and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure 2 5 Three of the four types of influenza viruses affect humans Type A Type B and Type C 2 7 Type D has not been known to infect humans but is believed to have the potential to do so 7 8 Usually the virus is spread through the air from coughs or sneezes 1 This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances 9 It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes 5 9 A person may be infectious to others both before and during the time they are showing symptoms 5 The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat sputum or nose for the virus 2 A number of rapid tests are available however people may still have the infection even if the results are negative 2 A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the viruss RNA is more accurate 2 Frequent hand washing reduces the risk of viral spread 3 Wearing a surgical mask is also useful 3 Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization WHO for those at high risk 1 and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC for those six months of age and older 10 The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza 1 It is usually welltolerated 11 A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year since the virus evolves rapidly 1 Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir among others have been used to treat influenza 1 The benefit of antiviral drugs in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than their risks 12 No benefit has been found in those with other health problems 12 13 Influenza spreads around the world in yearly outbreaks resulting in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 290000 to 650000 deaths 4 1 About 20 of unvaccinated children and 10 of unvaccinated adults are infected each year 14 In the northern and southern parts of the world outbreaks occur mainly in the winter while around the equator outbreaks may occur at any time of the year 11 Death occurs mostly in high risk groupsthe young the old and those with other health problems 1 Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent 2 In the 20th century three influenza pandemics occurred Spanish influenza in 1918 4050 million deaths Asian influenza in 1957 two million deaths and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 one million deaths 15 The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza AH1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009 16 Influenza may also affect other animals including pigs horses and birds 17 Play media Video summary script mwparseroutput toclimit2 toclevel1

with fever and cough the most common symptoms 18 Approximately 33 of people with influenza are asymptomatic 21 22 Symptoms of influenza can start quite suddenly one to two days after infection Usually the first symptoms are chills and body aches but fever is also common early in the infection with body temperatures ranging from 38 to 39 C approximately 100 to 103 F 23 Many people are so ill that they are confined to bed for several days with aches and pains throughout their bodies which are worse in their backs and legs 24 Symptoms of influenza Fever and chills Cough Nasal congestion Runny nose Sore throat Hoarseness Earache Muscle pains Fatigue Headache Irritated watering eyes Reddened eyes skin especially face mouth throat and nose Petechial rash 25 In children gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting diarrhea and abdominal pain 26 27 may be severe in children with influenza B 28 It can be difficult to distinguish between the common cold and influenza in the early stages of these infections 29 Influenza symptoms are a mixture of symptoms of common cold and pneumonia body ache headache and fatigue Diarrhea is not usually a symptom of influenza in adults 18 although it has been seen in some human cases of the H5N1 bird flu 30 and can be a symptom in children 26 The symptoms most reliably seen in influenza are shown in the adjacent table 18 The specific combination of fever and cough has been found to be the best predictor diagnostic accuracy increases with a body temperature above 38C 1004F 31 Two decision analysis studies 32 33 suggest that during local outbreaks of influenza the prevalence will be over 70 33 Even in the absence of a local outbreak diagnosis may be justified in the elderly during the influenza season as long as the prevalence is over 15 33 The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC maintains an uptodate summary of available laboratory tests 34 According to the CDC rapid diagnostic tests have a sensitivity of 5075 and specificity of 9095 when compared with viral culture 35 Occasionally influenza can cause severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia 36 37 The obvious symptom is trouble breathing In addition if a child or presumably an adult seems to be getting better and then relapses with a high fever that is a danger sign since this relapse can be bacterial pneumonia 38 Sometimes influenza may have abnormal presentations like confusion in the elderly and a sepsislike syndrome in the young 39 Emergency warning signs Shortness of breath Chest pain Dizziness Confusion Extreme vomiting Flu symptoms that improve but then relapse with a high fever and severe cough can be bacterial pneumonia Cyanosis High fever and a rash Inability to drink fluids Signs of dehydration in infants Far fewer wet diapers than usual 40 Cannot keep down fluids in infants No tears when crying Virology Types of virus Structure of the influenza virion The hemagglutinin HA and neuraminidase NA proteins are shown on the surface of the particle The viral RNAs that make up the genome are shown as red coils inside the particle and bound to ribonuclearproteins RNP In virus classification influenza viruses are RNA viruses that make up four of the seven genera of the family Orthomyxoviridae 41 Influenzavirus A Influenzavirus B Influenzavirus C Influenzavirus D These viruses are only distantly related to the human parainfluenza viruses which are RNA viruses belonging to the paramyxovirus family that are a common cause of respiratory infections in children such as croup 42 but can also cause a disease similar to influenza in adults 43 A fourth family of influenza viruses was identified in 2016 Influenza D 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 The type species for this family is Influenza D virus which was first isolated in 2011 8 Influenzavirus A This genus has one species influenza A virus Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a large variety of influenza A 51 Occasionally viruses are transmitted to other species and may then cause devastating outbreaks in domestic poultry or give rise to human influenza pandemics 51 The influenza A virus can be subdivided into different serotypes based on the antibody response to these viruses 52 The serotypes that have been confirmed in humans are H1N1 which caused Spanish flu in 1918 and Swine Flu in 2009 H2N2 which caused Asian Flu in 1957 H3N2 which caused Hong Kong Flu in 1968 H5N1 which caused Bird Flu in 2004 53 54 H7N7 which has unusual zoonotic potential 55 H1N2 endemic in humans pigs and birds H9N2 H7N2 H7N3 H10N7 H7N9 rated in 2018 as having the greatest pandemic potential among the Type A subtypes 56 H6N1 which only infected one person who recovered 57 Influenzavirus B Influenza virus nomenclature for a Fujian flu virus This genus has one species influenza B virus Influenza B almost exclusively infects humans 52 and is less common than influenza A The only other animals known to be susceptible to influenza B infection are the seal 58 and the ferret 59 This type of influenza mutates at a rate 23 times slower than type A 60 and consequently is less genetically diverse with only one influenza B serotype 52 As a result of this lack of antigenic diversity a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age However influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible 61 This reduced rate of antigenic change combined with its limited host range inhibiting cross species antigenic shift ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur 62 Influenzavirus C This genus has one species influenza C virus which infects humans dogs and pigs sometimes causing both severe illness and local epidemics 63 64 However influenza C is less common than the other types and usually only causes mild disease in children 65 66 Influenzavirus D This genus has only one species influenza D virus which infects pigs and cattle The virus has the potential to infect humans although no such cases have been observed yet 8 Structure properties and subtype nomenclature Influenzaviruses A B C and D are very similar in overall structure 8 67 68 The virus particle also called the virion is 80120 nanometers in diameter such that the smallest virions adopt an elliptical shape 69 The length of each particle varies considerably owing to the fact that influenza is pleomorphic and can be in excess of many tens of micrometers producing filamentous virions 70 However despite these varied shapes the viral particles of all influenza viruses are similar in composition 71 These are made of a viral envelope containing two main types of glycoproteins wrapped around a central core The central core contains the viral RNA genome and other viral proteins that package and protect this RNA RNA tends to be single stranded but in special cases it is double 72 Unusually for a virus its genome is not a single piece of nucleic acid instead it contains seven or eight pieces of segmented negativesense RNA each piece of RNA containing either one or two genes which code for a gene product protein 71 For example the influenza A genome contains 11 genes on eight pieces of RNA encoding for 11 proteins hemagglutinin HA neuraminidase NA nucleoprotein NP M1 matrix 1 protein M2 NS1 nonstructural protein 1 NS2 other name is NEP nuclear export protein PA PB1 polymerase basic 1 PB1F2 and PB2 73 Hemagglutinin HA and neuraminidase NA are the two large glycoproteins on the outside of the viral particles HA is a lectin that mediates binding of the virus to target cells and entry of the viral genome into the target cell while NA is involved in the release of progeny virus from infected cells by cleaving sugars that bind the mature viral particles 74 Thus these proteins are targets for antiviral drugs 75 Furthermore they are antigens to which antibodies can be raised Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on antibody responses to HA and NA These different types of HA and NA form the basis of the H and N distinctions in for example H5N1 76 There are 18 H and 11 N subtypes known but only H 1 2 and 3 and N 1 and 2 are commonly found in humans 77 78 Replication Host cell invasion and replication by the influenza virus The steps in this process are discussed in the text Viruses can replicate only in living cells 79 Influenza infection and replication is a multistep process First the virus has to bind to and enter the cell then deliver its genome to a site where it can produce new copies of viral proteins and RNA assemble these components into new viral particles and last exit the host cell 71 Influenza viruses bind through hemagglutinin onto sialic acid sugars on the surfaces of epithelial cells typically in the nose throat and lungs of mammals and intestines of birds Stage 1 in infection figure 80 After the hemagglutinin is cleaved by a protease the cell imports the virus by endocytosis 81 The intracellular details are still being elucidated It is known that virions converge to the microtubule organizing center interact with acidic endosomes and finally enter the target endosomes for genome release 82 Once inside the cell the acidic conditions in the endosome cause two events to happen First part of the hemagglutinin protein fuses the viral envelope with the vacuoles membrane then the M2 ion channel allows protons to move through the viral envelope and acidify the core of the virus which causes the core to disassemble and release the viral RNA and core proteins 71 The viral RNA vRNA molecules accessory proteins and RNAdependent RNA polymerase are then released into the cytoplasm Stage 2 83 The M2 ion channel is blocked by amantadine drugs preventing infection 84 These core proteins and vRNA form a complex that is transported into the cell nucleus where the RNAdependent RNA polymerase begins transcribing complementary positivesense vRNA Steps 3a and b 85 The vRNA either is exported into the cytoplasm and translated step 4 or remains in the nucleus Newly synthesized viral proteins are either secreted through the Golgi apparatus onto the cell surface in the case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin step 5b or transported back into the nucleus to bind vRNA and form new viral genome particles step 5a Other viral proteins have multiple actions in the host cell including degrading cellular mRNA and using the released nucleotides for vRNA synthesis and also inhibiting translation of hostcell mRNAs 86 Negativesense vRNAs that form the genomes of future viruses RNAdependent RNA polymerase and other viral proteins are assembled into a virion Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules cluster into a bulge in the cell membrane The vRNA and viral core proteins leave the nucleus and enter this membrane protrusion step 6 The mature virus buds off from the cell in a sphere of host phospholipid membrane acquiring hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with this membrane coat step 7 87 As before the viruses adhere to the cell through hemagglutinin the mature viruses detach once their neuraminidase has cleaved sialic acid residues from the host cell 80 After the release of new influenza viruses the host cell dies Because of the absence of RNA proofreading enzymes the RNAdependent RNA polymerase that copies the viral genome makes an error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides which is the approximate length of the influenza vRNA Hence the majority of newly manufactured influenza viruses are mutants this causes antigenic drift which is a slow change in the antigens on the viral surface over time 88 The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing or reassortment of vRNAs if more than one type of influenza virus infects a single cell The resulting rapid change in viral genetics produces antigenic shifts which are sudden changes from one antigen to another These sudden large changes allow the virus to infect new host species and quickly overcome protective immunity 76 This is important in the emergence of pandemics as discussed below in the section on epidemiology Mechanism Transmission When an infected person sneezes or coughs more than half a million virus particles can be spread to those close by 89 In otherwise healthy adults influenza virus shedding the time during which a person might be infectious to another person increases sharply onehalf to one day after infection peaks on day 2 and persists for an average total duration of 5 daysbut can persist as long as 9 days 21 In those who develop symptoms from experimental infection only 67 of healthy experimentally infected individuals symptoms and viral shedding show a similar pattern but with viral shedding preceding illness by one day 21 Children are much more infectious than adults and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until two weeks after infection 90 In immunocompromised people viral shedding can continue for longer than two weeks 91 Influenza can be spread in three main ways 92 93 by direct transmission when an infected person sneezes mucus directly into the eyes nose or mouth of another person the airborne route when someone inhales the aerosols produced by an infected person coughing sneezing or spitting and through handtoeye handtonose or handtomouth transmission either from contaminated surfaces or from direct personal contact such as a handshake The relative importance of these three modes of transmission is unclear and they may all contribute to the spread of the virus 9 In the airborne route the droplets that are small enough for people to inhale are 05 to 5 μm in diameter and inhaling just one droplet might be enough to cause an infection 92 Although a single sneeze releases up to 40000 droplets 94 most of these droplets are quite large and will quickly settle out of the air 92 How long influenza survives in airborne droplets seems to be influenced by the levels of humidity and UV radiation with low humidity and a lack of sunlight in winter aiding its survival 92 As the influenza virus can persist outside of the body it can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces such as banknotes 95 doorknobs light switches and other household items 24 The length of time the virus will persist on a surface varies with the virus surviving for one to two days on hard nonporous surfaces such as plastic or metal for about fifteen minutes on dry paper tissues and only five minutes on skin 96 However if the virus is present in mucus this can protect it for longer periods up to 17 days on banknotes 92 95 Avian influenza viruses can survive indefinitely when frozen 97 They are inactivated by heating to 56 C 133 F for a minimum of 60 minutes as well as by acids at pH 2 97 Pathophysiology The different sites of infection shown in red of seasonal H1N1 versus avian H5N1 This influences their lethality and ability to spread The mechanisms by which influenza infection causes symptoms in humans have been studied intensively One of the mechanisms is believed to be the inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH resulting in lowered cortisol levels 98 Knowing which genes are carried by a particular strain can help predict how well it will infect humans and how severe this infection will be that is predict the strains pathophysiology 64 99 For instance part of the process that allows influenza viruses to invade cells is the cleavage of the viral hemagglutinin protein by any one of several human proteases 81 In mild and avirulent viruses the structure of the hemagglutinin means that it can only be cleaved by proteases found in the throat and lungs so these viruses cannot infect other tissues However in highly virulent strains such as H5N1 the hemagglutinin can be cleaved by a wide variety of proteases allowing the virus to spread throughout the body 99 The viral hemagglutinin protein is responsible for determining both which species a strain can infect and where in the human respiratory tract a strain of influenza will bind 100 Strains that are easily transmitted between people have hemagglutinin proteins that bind to receptors in the upper part of the respiratory tract such as in the nose throat and mouth In contrast the highly lethal H5N1 strain binds to receptors that are mostly found deep in the lungs 101 This difference in the site of infection may be part of the reason why the H5N1 strain causes severe viral pneumonia in the lungs but is not easily transmitted by people coughing and sneezing 102 103 Common symptoms of the flu such as fever headaches and fatigue are the result of the huge amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interferon or tumor necrosis factor produced from influenzainfected cells 29 104 In contrast to the rhinovirus that causes the common cold influenza does cause tissue damage so symptoms are not entirely due to the inflammatory response 105 This massive immune response might produce a lifethreatening cytokine storm This effect has been proposed to be the cause of the unusual lethality of both the H5N1 avian influenza 106 and the 1918 pandemic strain 107 108 However another possibility is that these large amounts of cytokines are just a result of the massive levels of viral replication produced by these strains and the immune response does not itself contribute to the disease 109 Influenza appear to trigger programmed cell death apoptosis 110 Prevention Vaccination Main article Influenza vaccine Giving an influenza vaccination The influenza vaccine is recommended by the World Health Organization WHO for highrisk groups such as pregnant women children aged less than five years the elderly health care workers and people who have chronic illnesses such as HIVAIDS asthma diabetes heart disease or are immunocompromised among others 111 112 The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC recommends the influenza vaccine for those aged six months or older who do not have contraindications 113 10 In healthy adults it is modestly effective in decreasing the amount of influenzalike symptoms in a population 114 In healthy children over the age of two years the vaccine reduces the chances of getting influenza by around twothirds while it has not been well studied in children under two years 115 In those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease vaccination reduces exacerbations 116 it is not clear if it reduces asthma exacerbations 117 Evidence supports a lower rate of influenzalike illness in many groups who are immunocompromised such as those with HIVAIDS cancer and post organ transplant 118 In those at high risk immunization may reduce the risk of heart disease 119 Whether immunizing health care workers affects patient outcomes is controversial with some reviews finding insufficient evidence 120 121 and others finding tentative evidence 122 123 Due to the high mutation rate of the virus a particular influenza vaccine usually confers protection for no more than a few years Each year the World Health Organization predicts which strains of the virus are most likely to be circulating in the next year see Historical annual reformulations of the influenza vaccine allowing pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines that will provide the best immunity against these strains 124 The vaccine is reformulated each season for a few specific flu strains but does not include all the strains active in the world during that season It takes about six months for the manufacturers to formulate and produce the millions of doses required to deal with the seasonal epidemics occasionally a new or overlooked strain becomes prominent during that time 125 It is also possible to get infected just before vaccination and get sick with the strain that the vaccine is supposed to prevent as the vaccine takes about two weeks to become effective 126 Vaccines can cause the immune system to react as if the body were actually being infected and general infection symptoms many cold and flu symptoms are just general infection symptoms can appear though these symptoms are usually not as severe or longlasting as influenza The most dangerous adverse effect is a severe allergic reaction to either the virus material itself or residues from the hen eggs used to grow the influenza however these reactions are extremely rare 127 A 2018 Cochrane review of children in good general health found that the live immunization seemed to lower the risk of getting influenza for the season from 18 to 4 The inactivated vaccine seemed to lower the risk of getting flu for the season from 30 to 11 Not enough data was available to draw definite conclusions about serious complications such as pneumonia or hospitalization 115 For healthy adults a 2018 Cochrane review showed that vaccines reduced the incidence of labconfirmed influenza from 23 to 09 which constitutes a reduction of risk of approximately 60 However for influenzalike illness which is defined as the same symptoms of cough fever headache runny nose and bodily aches and pains vaccine reduced the risk from 215 to 181 This constitutes a much more modest reduction of risk of approximately 16 The difference is most probably explained by the fact that over 200 viruses cause the same or similar symptoms as the flu virus 114 Another review looked at the effect of short and long term exercise before the vaccine however no benefits or harms were recorded 128 The costeffectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings 129 It has generally been found to be a costeffective intervention especially in children 130 and the elderly 131 however the results of economic evaluations of influenza vaccination have often been found to be dependent on key assumptions 132 133 Infection control Further information Influenza prevention These are the main ways that influenza spreads by direct transmission when an infected person sneezes mucus directly into the eyes nose or mouth of another person the airborne route when someone inhales the aerosols produced by an infected person coughing sneezing or spitting through handtoeye handtonose or handtomouth transmission either from contaminated surfaces or from direct personal contact such as a handshake Reasonably effective ways to reduce the transmission of influenza include good personal health and hygiene habits such as not touching your eyes nose or mouth 134 frequent hand washing with soap and water or with alcoholbased hand rubs 135 covering coughs and sneezes avoiding close contact with sick people and staying home yourself if you are sick Avoiding spitting is also recommended 136 Although face masks might help prevent transmission when caring for the sick 137 138 there is mixed evidence on beneficial effects in the community 136 139 Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza as well as producing more severe disease symptoms 140 141 Since influenza spreads through both aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces surface sanitizing may help prevent some infections 142 Alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses while quaternary ammonium compounds can be used with alcohol so that the sanitizing effect lasts for longer 143 In hospitals quaternary ammonium compounds and bleach are used to sanitize rooms or equipment that have been occupied by people with influenza symptoms 143 At home this can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach 144 Social distancing strategies used during past pandemics such as closing schools churches and theaters slowed the spread of the virus but did not have a large effect on the overall death rate 145 146 It is uncertain if reducing public gatherings by for example closing schools and workplaces will reduce transmission since people with influenza may just be moved from one area to another such measures would also be difficult to enforce and might be unpopular 136 When small numbers of people are infected isolating the sick might reduce the risk of transmission 136 Diagnosis 29 yr old with H1N1 confirmed There are a number of rapid tests for the flu One is called a Rapid Molecular Assay when an upper respiratory tract specimen mucus is taken using a nasal swab or a nasopharyngeal swab 147 It should be done within 34 days of symptom onset as upper respiratory viral shedding takes a downward spiral after that 39 Treatment Main article Influenza treatment People with the flu are advised to get plenty of rest drink plenty of liquids avoid using alcohol and tobacco and if necessary take medications such as acetaminophen paracetamol to relieve the fever and muscle aches associated with the flu 148 149 In contrast there is not enough evidence to support corticosteroids as add on therapy for influenza 150 It is advised to avoid close contact with others to prevent spread of infection 148 149 Children and teenagers with flu symptoms particularly fever should avoid taking aspirin during an influenza infection especially influenza type B because doing so can lead to Reyes syndrome a rare but potentially fatal disease of the liver 151 Since influenza is caused by a virus antibiotics have no effect on the infection unless prescribed for secondary infections such as bacterial pneumonia Antiviral medication may be effective if given early within 48 hours to first symptoms but some strains of influenza can show resistance to the standard antiviral drugs and there is concern about the quality of the research 152 Highrisk individuals such as young children pregnant women the elderly and those with compromised immune systems should visit the doctor for antiviral drugs Those with the emergency warning signs should visit the emergency room at once 153 Antivirals The two classes of antiviral drugs used against influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir zanamivir laninamivir and peramivir and M2 protein inhibitors adamantane derivatives Neuraminidase inhibitors Overall the benefits of neuraminidase inhibitors in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than the risks 12 There does not appear to be any benefit in those with other health problems 12 In those believed to have the flu they decreased the length of time symptoms were present by slightly less than a day but did not appear to affect the risk of complications such as needing hospitalization or pneumonia 13 Increasingly prevalent resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has led to researchers to seek alternative antiviral drugs with different mechanisms of action 154 M2 inhibitors The antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine inhibit a viral ion channel M2 protein thus inhibiting replication of the influenza A virus 84 These drugs are sometimes effective against influenza A if given early in the infection but are ineffective against influenza B viruses which lack the M2 drug target 155 Measured resistance to amantadine and rimantadine in American isolates of H3N2 has increased to 91 in 2005 156 This high level of resistance may be due to the easy availability of amantadines as part of overthecounter cold remedies in countries such as China and Russia 157 and their use to prevent outbreaks of influenza in farmed poultry 158 159 The CDC recommended against using M2 inhibitors during the 200506 influenza season due to high levels of drug resistance 160 Prognosis Influenzas effects are much more severe and last longer than those of the common cold Most people will recover completely in about one to two weeks but others will develop lifethreatening complications such as pneumonia Thus influenza can be deadly especially for the weak young and old those with compromised immune systems or the chronically ill 76 People with a weak immune system such as people with advanced HIV infection or transplant recipients whose immune systems are medically suppressed to prevent transplant organ rejection suffer from particularly severe disease 161 Pregnant women and young children are also at a high risk for complications 162 The flu can worsen chronic health problems People with emphysema chronic bronchitis or asthma may experience shortness of breath while they have the flu and influenza may cause worsening of coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure 163 Smoking is another risk factor associated with more serious disease and increased mortality from influenza 140 According to the World Health Organization Every winter tens of millions of people get the flu Most are only ill and out of work for a week yet the elderly are at a higher risk of death from the illness We know the worldwide death toll exceeds a few hundred thousand people a year but even in developed countries the numbers are uncertain because medical authorities dont usually verify who actually died of influenza and who died of a flulike illness 164 Even healthy people can be affected and serious problems from influenza can happen at any age People over 65 years old pregnant women very young children and people of any age with chronic medical conditions are more likely to get complications from influenza such as pneumonia bronchitis sinus and ear infections 165 In some cases an autoimmune response to an influenza infection may contribute to the development of GuillainBarré syndrome 166 However as many other infections can increase the risk of this disease influenza may only be an important cause during epidemics 166 167 This syndrome has been believed to also be a rare side effect of influenza vaccines One review gives an incidence of about one case per million vaccinations 168 Getting infected by influenza itself increases both the risk of death up to 1 in 10000 and increases the risk of developing GBS to a much higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement approx 10 times higher by recent estimates 169 166 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Children of any age with neurologic conditions are more likely than other children to become very sick if they get the flu Flu complications may vary and for some children can include pneumonia and even death 170 Influenza encephalitis MRI Neurological conditions can include Disorders of the brain and spinal cord Cerebral palsy Epilepsy seizure disorders Stroke Intellectual disability Moderate to severe developmental delay Muscular dystrophy Spinal cord injury These conditions can impair coughing swallowing clearing the airways and in the worst cases breathing Therefore they worsen the flu symptoms 170 Epidemiology Seasonal variations Further information Flu season Seasonal risk areas for influenza NovemberApril blue AprilNovember red and yearround yellow Influenza reaches peak prevalence in winter and because the Northern and Southern Hemispheres have winter at different times of the year there are actually two different flu seasons each year This is why the World Health Organization assisted by the National Influenza Centers makes recommendations for two different vaccine formulations every year one for the Northern and one for the Southern Hemisphere 124 A longstanding puzzle has been why outbreaks of the flu occur seasonally rather than uniformly throughout the year One possible explanation is that because people are indoors more often during the winter they are in close contact more often and this promotes transmission from person to person Increased travel due to the Northern Hemisphere winter holiday season may also play a role 171 Another factor is that cold temperatures lead to drier air which may dehydrate mucus particles Dry particles are lighter and can thus remain airborne for a longer period The virus also survives longer on surfaces at colder temperatures and aerosol transmission of the virus is highest in cold environments less than 5 C with low relative humidity 172 The lower air humidity in winter seems to be the main cause of seasonal influenza transmission in temperate regions 173 174 However seasonal changes in infection rates also occur in tropical regions and in some countries these peaks of infection are seen mainly during the rainy season 175 Seasonal changes in contact rates from school terms which are a major factor in other childhood diseases such as measles and pertussis may also play a role in the flu A combination of these small seasonal effects may be amplified by dynamical resonance with the endogenous disease cycles 176 H5N1 exhibits seasonality in both humans and birds 177 178 An alternative hypothesis to explain seasonality in influenza infections is an effect of vitamin D levels on immunity to the virus 179 This idea was first proposed by Robert Edgar HopeSimpson in 1965 180 He proposed that the cause of influenza epidemics during winter may be connected to seasonal fluctuations of vitamin D which is produced in the skin under the influence of solar or artificial UV radiation This could explain why influenza occurs mostly in winter and during the tropical rainy season when people stay indoors away from the sun and their vitamin D levels fall Epidemic and pandemic spread Further information Flu pandemic As influenza is caused by a variety of species and strains of viruses in any given year some strains can die out while others create epidemics while yet another strain can cause a pandemic Typically in a years normal two flu seasons one per hemisphere there are between three and five million cases of severe illness and around 650000 deaths worldwide 4 1 181 which by some definitions is a yearly influenza epidemic 1 Although the incidence of influenza can vary widely between years approximately 36000 deaths and more than 200000 hospitalizations are directly associated with influenza every year in the United States 182 183 One method of calculating influenza mortality produced an estimate of 41400 average deaths per year in the United States between 1979 and 2001 184 Different methods in 2010 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC reported a range from a low of about 3300 deaths to a high of 49000 per year 185 Roughly three times per century a pandemic occurs which infects a large proportion of the worlds population and can kill tens of millions of people see pandemics section One study estimated that if a strain with similar virulence to the 1918 influenza emerged today it could kill between 50 and 80 million people 186 Antigenic shift or reassortment can result in novel and highly pathogenic strains of human influenza New influenza viruses are constantly evolving by mutation or by reassortment 52 Mutations can cause small changes in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens on the surface of the virus This is called antigenic drift which slowly creates an increasing variety of strains until one evolves that can infect people who are immune to the preexisting strains This new variant then replaces the older strains as it rapidly sweeps through the human population often causing an epidemic 187 However since the strains produced by drift will still be reasonably similar to the older strains some people will still be immune to them In contrast when influenza viruses reassort they acquire completely new antigensfor example by reassortment between avian strains and human strains this is called antigenic shift If a human influenza virus is produced that has entirely new antigens everybody will be susceptible and the novel influenza will spread uncontrollably causing a pandemic 188 In contrast to this model of pandemics based on antigenic drift and shift an alternative approach has been proposed where the periodic pandemics are produced by interactions of a fixed set of viral strains with a human population with a constantly changing set of immunities to different viral strains 189 The generation time for influenza the time from one infection to the next is very short only 2 days This explains why influenza epidemics start and finish in a short time scale of only a few months 190 From a public health point of view flu epidemics spread rapidly and are very difficult to control Most influenza virus strains are not very infectious and each infected individual will only go on to infect one or two other individuals the basic reproduction number for influenza is generally around 14 However the generation time for influenza is extremely short the time from a person becoming infected to when he infects the next person is only two days The short generation time means that influenza epidemics generally peak at around 2 months and burn out after 3 months the decision to intervene in an influenza epidemic therefore has to be taken early and the decision is therefore often made on the back of incomplete data Another problem is that individuals become infectious before they become symptomatic which means that putting people in quarantine after they become ill is not an effective public health intervention 190 For the average person viral shedding tends to peak on day two whereas symptoms peak on day three 21 History See also Timeline of influenza Etymology The word Influenza comes from the Italian language meaning influence and refers to the cause of the disease initially this ascribed illness to unfavorable astrological influences It was introduced into English in the mideighteenth century during a panEuropean epidemic 191 Archaic terms for influenza include epidemic catarrh la grippe from the French first used by Molyneaux in 1694 192 sweating sickness and Spanish fever particularly for the 1918 flu pandemic strain 193 Pandemics Further information Influenza pandemic Spanish flu and Hong Kong flu The difference between the influenza mortality age distributions of the 1918 epidemic and normal epidemics Deaths per 100000 persons in each age group United States for the interpandemic years 19111917 dashed line and the pandemic year 1918 solid line 194 Thermal imaging camera and screen photographed in an airport terminal in Greece during the 2009 flu pandemic Thermal imaging can detect elevated body temperature one of the signs of swine flu The symptoms of human influenza were clearly described by Hippocrates roughly 2400 years ago 195 196 Although the virus seems to have caused epidemics throughout human history historical data on influenza are difficult to interpret because the symptoms can be similar to those of other respiratory diseases 197 192 The disease may have spread from Europe to the Americas as early as the European colonization of the Americas since almost the entire indigenous population of the Antilles was killed by an epidemic resembling influenza that broke out in 1493 after the arrival of Christopher Columbus 198 199 The first convincing record of an influenza pandemic was of an outbreak in 1580 which began in Russia and spread to Europe via Africa In Rome over 8000 people were killed and several Spanish cities were almost wiped out Pandemics continued sporadically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries with the pandemic of 18301833 being particularly widespread it infected approximately a quarter of the people exposed 192 The most famous and lethal outbreak was the 1918 flu pandemic Spanish flu pandemic type A influenza H1N1 subtype which lasted from 1918 to 1919 It is not known exactly how many it killed but estimates range from 50 to 100 million people 194 200 201 This pandemic has been described as the greatest medical holocaust in history and may have killed as many people as the Black Death 192 This huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50 and the extreme severity of the symptoms suspected to be caused by cytokine storms 201 Symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue cholera or typhoid One observer wrote One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes especially from the nose stomach and intestine Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred 200 The majority of deaths were from bacterial pneumonia a secondary infection caused by influenza but the virus also killed people directly causing massive hemorrhages and edema in the lung 202 The 1918 flu pandemic was truly global spreading even to the Arctic and remote Pacific islands The unusually severe disease killed between two and twenty percent of those infected as opposed to the more usual flu epidemic mortality rate of 01 194 200 Another unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults with 99 of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65 and more than half in young adults 20 to 40 years old 203 This is unusual since influenza is normally most deadly to the very young under age 2 and the very old over age 70 The total mortality of the 19181919 pandemic is not known but it is estimated that 25 to 5 of the worlds population was killed As many as 25 million may have been killed in the first 25 weeks in contrast HIVAIDS has killed 25 million in its first 25 years 200 Later flu pandemics were not so devastating They included the 1957 Asian Flu type A H2N2 strain and the 1968 Hong Kong Flu type A H3N2 strain but even these smaller outbreaks killed millions of people In later pandemics antibiotics were available to control secondary infections and this may have helped reduce mortality compared to the Spanish flu of 1918 194 Known flu pandemics 15 76 192 Name of pandemic Date Deaths Case fatality rate Subtype involved Pandemic Severity Index

virus to be isolated was from poultry when in 1901 the agent causing a disease called fowl plague was passed through Chamberland filters which have pores that are too small for bacteria to pass through 208 The etiological cause of influenza the virus family Orthomyxoviridae was first discovered in pigs by Richard Shope in 1931 209 This discovery was shortly followed by the isolation of the virus from humans by a group headed by Patrick Laidlaw at the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom in 1933 210 However it was not until Wendell Stanley first crystallized tobacco mosaic virus in 1935 that the noncellular nature of viruses was appreciated The main types of influenza viruses in humans Solid squares show the appearance of a new strain causing recurring influenza pandemics Broken lines indicate uncertain strain identifications 211 The first significant step towards preventing influenza was the development in 1944 of a killedvirus vaccine for influenza by Thomas Francis Jr This built on work by Australian Frank Macfarlane Burnet who showed that the virus lost virulence when it was cultured in fertilized hens eggs 212 Application of this observation by Francis allowed his group of researchers at the University of Michigan to develop the first influenza vaccine with support from the US Army 213 The Army was deeply involved in this research due to its experience of influenza in World War I when thousands of troops were killed by the virus in a matter of months 200 In comparison to vaccines the development of antiinfluenza drugs has been slower with amantadine being licensed in 1966 and almost thirty years later the next class of drugs the neuraminidase inhibitors being developed 214 Society and culture Further information Social impact of H5N1 Influenza produces direct costs due to lost productivity and associated medical treatment as well as indirect costs of preventative measures In the United States seasonal influenza is estimated to result in a total average annual economic cost of over 11billion with direct medical costs estimated to be over 3 billion annually 215 It has been estimated that a future pandemic could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs 216 However the economic impacts of past pandemics have not been intensively studied and some authors have suggested that the Spanish influenza actually had a positive longterm effect on percapita income growth despite a large reduction in the working population and severe shortterm depressive effects 217 Other studies have attempted to predict the costs of a pandemic as serious as the 1918 Spanish flu on the US economy where 30 of all workers became ill and 25 were killed A 30 sickness rate and a threeweek length of illness would decrease the gross domestic product by 5 Additional costs would come from medical treatment of 18 million to 45 million people and total economic costs would be approximately 700 billion 218 Preventative costs are also high Governments worldwide have spent billions of US dollars preparing and planning for a potential H5N1 avian influenza pandemic with costs associated with purchasing drugs and vaccines as well as developing disaster drills and strategies for improved border controls 219 On 1 November 2005 United States President George W Bush unveiled the National Strategy to Safeguard Against the Danger of Pandemic Influenza 216 backed by a request to Congress for 71 billion to begin implementing the plan 220 Internationally on 18 January 2006 donor nations pledged US2 billion to combat bird flu at the twoday International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Influenza held in China 221 222 In an assessment of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic on selected countries in the Southern Hemisphere data suggest that all countries experienced some timelimited andor geographically isolated socioeconomic effects and a temporary decrease in tourism most likely due to fear of 2009 H1N1 disease It is still too early to determine whether the H1N1 pandemic has caused any longterm economic impacts 223 Research Further information Influenza research Dr Terrence Tumpey examining a laboratorygrown reconstruction of the 1918 Spanish flu virus in a biosafety level 3 environment Research on influenza includes studies on molecular virology how the virus produces disease pathogenesis host immune responses viral genomics and how the virus spreads epidemiology These studies help in developing influenza countermeasures for example a better understanding of the bodys immune system response helps vaccine development and a detailed picture of how influenza invades cells aids the development of antiviral drugs One important basic research program is the Influenza Genome Sequencing Project which was initiated in 2004 to create a library of influenza sequences and help clarify which factors make one strain more lethal than another which genes most affect immunogenicity and how the virus evolves over time 224 The sequencing of the influenza genome and recombinant DNA technology may accelerate the generation of new vaccine strains by allowing scientists to substitute new antigens into a previously developed vaccine strain 225 Growing viruses in cell culture also promises higher yields less cost better quality and surge capacity 226 Research on a universal influenza A vaccine targeted against the external domain of the transmembrane viral M2 protein M2e is being done at the University of Ghent by Walter Fiers Xavier Saelens and their team 227 228 229 and has now successfully concluded Phase I clinical trials There has been some research success towards a universal flu vaccine that produces antibodies against proteins on the viral coat which mutate less rapidly and thus a single shot could potentially provide longerlasting protection 230 231 232 A number of biologics therapeutic vaccines and immunobiologics are also being investigated for treatment of infection caused by viruses Therapeutic biologics are designed to activate the immune response to virus or antigens Typically biologics do not target metabolic pathways like antiviral drugs but stimulate immune cells such as lymphocytes macrophages andor antigen presenting cells in an effort to drive an immune response towards a cytotoxic effect against the virus Influenza models such as murine influenza are convenient models to test the effects of prophylactic and therapeutic biologics For example Lymphocyte TCell Immune Modulator inhibits viral growth in the murine model of influenza 233 Other animals H5N1 Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 Genetic structure Infection Human mortality Global spread in 2004 in 2005 in 2006 in 2007 Social impact Pandemic Vaccine v t e Further information Influenzavirus A H5N1 and Transmission and infection of H5N1 Influenza infects many animal species and transfer of viral strains between species can occur Birds are thought to be the main animal reservoirs of influenza viruses 234 Most influenza strains are believed to have originated after humans began their intensive domestication of animals about 10000 years ago 235 Sixteen forms of hemagglutinin and nine forms of neuraminidase have been identified All known subtypes HxNy are found in birds but many subtypes are endemic in humans dogs horses and pigs populations of camels ferrets cats seals mink and whales also show evidence of prior infection or exposure to influenza 61 Variants of flu virus are sometimes named according to the species the strain is endemic in or adapted to The main variants named using this convention are bird flu human flu swine flu horse flu and dog flu Cat flu generally refers to feline viral rhinotracheitis or feline calicivirus and not infection from an influenza virus In pigs horses and dogs influenza symptoms are similar to humans with cough fever and loss of appetite 61 The frequency of animal diseases are not as wellstudied as human infection but an outbreak of influenza in harbor seals caused approximately 500 seal deaths off the New England coast in 19791980 236 However outbreaks in pigs are common and do not cause severe mortality 61 Vaccines have also been developed to protect poultry from avian influenza These vaccines can be effective against multiple strains and are used either as part of a preventative strategy or combined with culling in attempts to eradicate outbreaks 237 Bird flu Flu symptoms in birds are variable and can be unspecific 238 The symptoms following infection with lowpathogenicity avian influenza may be as mild as ruffled feathers a small reduction in egg production or weight loss combined with minor respiratory disease 239 Since these mild symptoms can make diagnosis in the field difficult tracking the spread of avian influenza requires laboratory testing of samples from infected birds Some strains such as Asian H9N2 are highly virulent to poultry and may cause more extreme symptoms and significant mortality 240 In its most highly pathogenic form influenza in chickens and turkeys produces a sudden appearance of severe symptoms and almost 100 mortality within two days 241 As the virus spreads rapidly in the crowded conditions seen in the intensive farming of chickens and turkeys these outbreaks can cause large economic losses to poultry farmers An avianadapted highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 called HPAI AH5N1 for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1 causes H5N1 flu commonly known as avian influenza or simply bird flu and is endemic in many bird populations especially in Southeast Asia This Asian lineage strain of HPAI AH5N1 is spreading globally It is epizootic an epidemic in nonhumans and panzootic a disease affecting animals of many species especially over a wide area killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the culling of hundreds of millions of other birds in an attempt to control its spread Most references in the media to bird flu and most references to H5N1 are about this specific strain 242 243 HPAI AH5N1 is an avian disease and there is no evidence suggesting efficient humantohuman transmission of HPAI AH5N1 In almost all cases those infected have had extensive physical contact with infected birds 244 H5N1 may mutate or reassort into a strain capable of efficient humantohuman transmission The exact changes that are required for this to happen are not well understood 245 Due to the high lethality and virulence of H5N1 its endemic presence and its large and increasing biological host reservoir the H5N1 virus was the worlds pandemic threat in the 200607 flu season and billions of dollars are being raised and spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential influenza pandemic 219 Chinese inspectors on an airplane checking passengers for fevers a common symptom of swine flu In March 2013 the Chinese government reported three cases of H7N9 influenza infections in humans Two of whom had died and the third was critically ill Although the strain of the virus is not thought to spread efficiently between humans 246 247 by midApril at least 82 persons had become ill from H7N9 of which 17 had died These cases include three small family clusters in Shanghai and one cluster between a neighboring girl and boy in Beijing raising at least the possibility of humantohuman transmission WHO points out that one cluster did not have two of the cases lab confirmed and further points out as a matter of baseline information that some viruses are able to cause limited humantohuman transmission under conditions of close contact but are not transmissible enough to cause large community outbreaks 248 249 250 Swine flu In pigs swine influenza produces fever lethargy sneezing coughing difficulty breathing and decreased appetite 251 In some cases the infection can cause abortion Although mortality is usually low the virus can produce weight loss and poor growth causing economic loss to farmers 251 Infected pigs can lose up to 12 pounds of body weight over a 3 to 4week period 251 Direct transmission of an influenza virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible this is called zoonotic swine flu In all 50 human cases are known to have occurred since the virus was identified in the mid20th century which have resulted in six deaths 252 In 2009 a swineorigin H1N1 virus strain commonly referred to as swine flu caused the 2009 flu pandemic but there is no evidence that it is endemic to pigs ie actually a swine flu or of transmission from pigs to people instead the virus spreads from person to person 253 254 This strain is a reassortment of several strains of H1N1 that are usually found separately in humans birds and pigs 255 References a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t
