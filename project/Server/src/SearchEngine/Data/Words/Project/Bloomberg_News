Bloomberg and Matthew Winkler in 1990 to deliver financial news reporting to Bloomberg Terminal subscribers 3 The agency was established in 1990 with a team of six people 4 Winkler was first editorinchief 5 In 2010 Bloomberg News included more than 2300 editors and reporters in 72 countries and 146 news bureaus worldwide 6 7 Beginnings 19901995 edit Bloomberg Business News was conceived as a way of expanding the services offered through the terminals According to Matthew Winkler then a writer for The Wall Street Journal Michael Bloomberg telephoned him in November 1989 and asked What would it take to get into the news business Knowing that Bloomberg had no experience in journalism Winkler presented him with a hypothetical ethical dilemma You have just published a story that says the chairmanand I mean chairmanof your biggest customer has taken 5 million from the corporate till He is with his secretary at a Rio de Janeiro resort and the secretarys spurned boyfriend calls to tip you off You get an independent verification that the story is true Then the phone rings The customers publicrelations person says Kill the story or we will return all the terminals we currently rent from you What would you do Winkler asked Go with the story Bloomberg replied Our lawyers will love the fees you generate 8 Winkler recalls this as his deciding moment the time at which he became willing to help Bloomberg build his news organization 8 The purpose of the service was to provide uptotheminute financial news communicated in a concise and intelligent way 9 As a fledgeling company in 1990 Bloomberg hoped that the news service would spread the company name sell more Bloomberg Terminals and end Bloombergs reliance on the Dow Jones News Services a valuable subscriber service for the Terminal 3 The creation of Bloomberg Business News required Winkler to open a Bloomberg office in Washington DC in order to report about political effects on the business world However the Standing Committee of Correspondents SCC in Washington required Bloomberg News be formally accredited to act as a legitimate news source a title that Bloomberg Business News only accomplished after agreeing to provide free terminals to major newspapers in exchange for news space in the publications 3 This accreditation led to an annual growth over 35 until 1995 3 During this growth period Bloomberg News opened a small television station in New York purchased New York Radio Station WNEW launched fifteenminute weekday business news programs for broadcast on PBS and opened offices in Hong Kong and Frankfurt Germany 3 By 1995 Bloomberg News had 335 reporters in 56 locations 10 19952000 edit The initial goal of Bloomberg Business News to increase terminal sales was adequately met by the midnineties and refocused the scope to their news service in order to rival the profitability of other media groups such as Reuters and Dow Jones This led to the creation of Bloombergs magazine Bloomberg Personal in 1995 which would be carried in the Sunday edition of 18 US papers 10 Also in 1995 Bloomberg launched a 24hour financial news service through Bloomberg Information Television and began wiring its terminals through DirecTV This simultaneously occurred with the launch of a web site to provide the audio feed of radio broadcasts 3 Bloomberg Business News was renamed Bloomberg News in 1997 By this time Bloomberg News content was carried in over 800 newspapers worldwide and was syndicated through Bloomberg Television and 40 international affiliates 10 20002014 edit In 2009 Bloomberg News partnered with The Washington Post to launch a global news service known as The Washington Post News Service with Bloomberg News Hosting content from both news sources the service hopes to pair the political experience of The Washington Post with the global financial economic news of Bloomberg News 11 In April 2014 Bloomberg News launched a new section Bloomberg Luxury which focuses on luxury living According to an internal memo obtained by WWD Chris Rovzar the former digital editor of Vanity Fair will help Bloomberg build its editorial vision for luxury 12 The sections content provides information on topics including travel wine news dining auto news gadgets and more Review of technology and highend autos are published weekly It also highlights content from Bloombergs quarterly lifestyle and luxury magazine Pursuits Bloomberg television has been criticized from overseas media claiming that Bloomberg attempts to hire young and pretty people especially women showing their bodies in a grotesque manner to increase ratings 2015 refocus edit A 2015 leaked internal memo by editorinchief John Micklethwait indicated an intent to refocus the agency to better target their core audience the clever customer who is short of time and better achieve the goal of being the definitive chronicle of capitalism This change would lead to a reduction in reporting on general interest topics eg sports in favor of business and economics topics 2 2018 redesign and paywall edit In 2018 John Micklethwait editorinchief of Bloomberg News announced a new design for the digital offerings of Bloomberg News Bloomberg started to charge visitors for its content with a metered paywall limiting users to view 10 articles per month and 30 minutes of Bloomberg Television Users who subscribe to Bloombergcom can access the whole site and receive subscriberonly digital content 13 14 Michael Bloomberg presidential campaign edit In November 2019 as Michael Bloomberg announced his presidential campaign editorinchief John Micklethwait ordered his staff not to investigate their boss nor any other Democratic candidates while investigations into Donald Trump would continue as the government of the day 15 Following Bloombergs announcement the Houston Chronicle dropped Bloomberg as a source for the 2020 Presidential campaign saying that journalists should not choose targets based on their political affiliation 16 Former Bloomberg News DC Bureau Chief Megan Murphy also criticized the decision saying it bars talented reporters and editors from covering massive crucial aspects of one of the defining elections of our time and calling the decision to avoid coverage not journalism 17 Responding to the controversy Michael Bloomberg told CBS News We just have to learn to live with some things He added that his reporters get a paycheck But with your paycheck comes some restrictions and responsibilities 18 Controversy edit China coverage edit Bloomberg News received a 2012 George Polk Award for its series of stories about Chinas political elite Revolution to Riches 19 20 One story in the series focused on the family wealth of Chinese leader Xi Jinping 21 Journalist and author Howard W French reported in the MayJune 2014 issue of the Columbia Journalism Review that prior to publication of the Xi story highlevel Bloomberg officials met with Chinese diplomats twice without informing the journalists who were working on the story 22 The first meeting was between Winkler and Zhang Yesui the Chinese ambassador to the United States Zhang is said to have told Winkler If Bloomberg publishes this story bad things will happen for Bloomberg in China If Bloomberg does not publish the story good things will happen for Bloomberg The second meeting occurred shortly after in New York and included Bloomberg Chairman Peter Grauer the companys then Chief Executive Daniel Doctoroff and an unnamed Chinese diplomat Around the time of the second meeting during a lengthy conference call with Bloomberg reporters and editors Doctoroff insisted on changes in the story that softened its impact by revising the language used to describe the Xi familys assets 22 After the Xi story appeared terminal sales in China slowed because government officials ordered state enterprises not to subscribe The Bloomberg News website was also blocked on Chinese servers and the company was unable to get visas for journalists it wanted to send to China 23 In 2014 Grauer told the staff at the Bloomberg Hong Kong bureau that the companys sales team had done a heroic job of mending relations with Chinese officials who had indicated their displeasure about the publication of the Xi revelations He also warned that if Bloomberg were to do anything like the Xi story again the company would be straight back in the shitbox 22 On October 29 2013 during a conference call Winkler told four Bloomberg journalists in Hong Kong that the findings of their major investigation into the hidden financial ties between one of the wealthiest men in China and the families of top Chinese leaders would not be published Less than a week later a second planned article about the children of senior Chinese officials employed by foreign banks was also killed according to Bloomberg employees 24 Unnamed Bloomberg employees quoted by The New York Times said the decision not to publish was made by the companys top editors led by Winkler According to one employee Winkler said If we run the story well be kicked out of China 24 When contacted by the Times Winkler said in an email that neither story had been killed What you have is untrue he wrote The stories are active and not spiked Laurie Hays the senior editor on the articles echoed his statement Winkler declined to discuss the conference call 24 The Winkler and Hays denials appeared in a story published by the Times on November 8 2013 At a mayoral news conference four days later Michael Bloomberg also denied the accusation He insisted that Bloomberg News did not do that the editors said that was just not the case Noting Winklers response to the Times he added No one thinks that we are wusses and not willing to stand up and write stories that are of interest to the public and that are factually correct He also said that because he was mayor of New York he was not involved in the operations of the news agency Ive recused myself from anything to do with the company he said 25 Three journalists left the company after news reports about the decision appeared reporter Michael Forsythe editor and reporter Amanda Bennett and Ben Richardson an editor at large for Asia news 26 27 Forsythe was the lead writer on the Xi Jinping story 22 Richardson said I left Bloomberg because of the way the story was mishandled and because of how the company made misleading statements in the global press and senior executives disparaged the team that worked so hard to execute an incredibly demanding story He also said that the company has threatened the journalists who worked on the story with legal action if they discuss the incident publicly 28 Taiwanbased Next Media Animation produced an animated cartoon ridiculing Winkler and Michael Bloomberg 29 According to French Bloombergs handling of the episode has tainted its corporate identity and journalism brand to a degree that could last for years 22 Fake News edit On December 16 2019 Frances financial markets watchdog the Autorité des marchés financiers AMF fined Bloomberg 5000000 for a report based on a fake news release that triggered a plunge in the shares of French construction giant Vinci and wiped billions off its market value 30 The AMF said Bloomberg distributed information that it should have known was false and that Bloomberg did not respect journalistic ethics as no verification of the information was undertaken before publication Bloomberg Businessweek edit See also Bloomberg Businessweek Bloomberg LP bought weekly business magazine
