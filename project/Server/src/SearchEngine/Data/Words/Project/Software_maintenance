engineering v t e Software maintenance in software engineering is the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults to improve performance or other attributes 1 A common perception of maintenance is that it merely involves fixing defects However one study indicated that over 80 of maintenance effort is used for noncorrective actions 2 This perception is perpetuated by users submitting problem reports that in reality are functionality enhancements to the system citation needed More recent studies put the bugfixing proportion closer to 21 3 Contents 1 History 2

Lehmans Laws Lehman 1997 Key findings of his research conclude that maintenance is really evolutionary development and that maintenance decisions are aided by understanding what happens to systems and software over time Lehman demonstrated that systems continue to evolve over time As they evolve they grow more complex unless some action such as code refactoring is taken to reduce the complexity In the late 1970s a famous and widely cited survey study by Lientz and Swanson exposed the very high fraction of lifecycle costs that were being expended on maintenance They categorized maintenance activities into four classes Adaptive modifying the system to cope with changes in the software environment DBMS OS 4 Perfective implementing new or changed user requirements which concern functional enhancements to the software Corrective diagnosing and fixing errors possibly ones found by users 4 Preventive increasing software maintainability or reliability to prevent problems in the future 4 The survey showed that around 75 of the maintenance effort was on the first two types and error correction consumed about 21 Many subsequent studies suggest a similar problem magnitude Studies show that contribution of end users is crucial during the new requirement data gathering and analysis This is the main cause of any problem during software evolution and maintenance Software maintenance is important because it consumes a large part of the overall lifecycle costs and also the inability to change software quickly and reliably means that business opportunities are lost 5 6 7 Importance of software maintenance edit The key software maintenance issues are both managerial and technical Key management issues are alignment with customer priorities staffing which organization does maintenance estimating costs Key technical issues are limited understanding impact analysis testing maintainability measurement Software maintenance is a very broad activity that includes error correction enhancements of capabilities deletion of obsolete capabilities and optimization Because change is inevitable mechanisms must be developed for evaluation controlling and making modifications So any work done to change the software after it is in operation is considered to be maintenance workThe purpose is to preserve the value of software over the time The value can be enhanced by expanding the customer base meeting additional requirements becoming easier to use more efficient and employing newer technology Maintenance may span for 20 years citation needed whereas development may be 12 years citation needed Software maintenance planning edit An integral part of software is the maintenance one which requires an accurate maintenance plan to be prepared during the software development It should specify how users will request modifications or report problems The budget should include resource and cost estimates A new decision should be addressed for the developing of every new system feature and its quality objectives The software maintenance which can last for 56 years or even decades after the development process calls for an effective plan which can address the scope of software maintenance the tailoring of the post deliverydeployment process the designation of who will provide maintenance and an estimate of the lifecycle costs The selection of proper enforcement of standards is the challenging task right from early stage of software engineering which has not got definite importance by the concerned stakeholders Software maintenance processes edit This section describes the six software maintenance processes as The implementation process contains software preparation and transition activities such as the conception and creation of the maintenance plan the preparation for handling problems identified during development and the followup on product configuration management The problem and modification analysis process which is executed once the application has become the responsibility of the maintenance group The maintenance programmer must analyze each request confirm it by reproducing the situation and check its validity investigate it and propose a solution document the request and the solution proposal and finally obtain all the required authorizations to apply the modifications The process considering the implementation of the modification itself The process acceptance of the modification by confirming the modified work with the individual who submitted the request in order to make sure the modification provided a solution The migration process platform migration for example is exceptional and is not part of daily maintenance tasks If the software must be ported to another platform without any change in functionality this process will be used and a maintenance project team is likely to be assigned to this task Finally the last maintenance process also an event which does not occur on a daily basis is the retirement of a piece of software There are a number of processes activities and practices that are unique to maintainers for example Transition a controlled and coordinated sequence of activities during which a system is transferred progressively from the developer to the maintainer Service Level Agreements SLAs and specialized domainspecific maintenance contracts negotiated by maintainers Modification Request and Problem Report Help Desk a problemhandling process used by maintainers to prioritize documents and route the requests they receive Categories of maintenance in ISOIEC 14764 edit EB Swanson initially identified three categories of maintenance corrective adaptive and perfective 8 The IEEE 1219 standard was superseded in June 2010 by P14764 9 These have since been updated and ISOIEC 14764 presents Corrective maintenance Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems Adaptive maintenance Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment Perfective maintenance Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability Preventive maintenance Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults There is also a notion of predeliveryprerelease maintenance which is all the good things you do to lower the total cost of ownership of the software Things like compliance with coding standards that includes software maintainability goals The management of coupling and cohesion of the software The attainment of software supportability goals SAE JA1004 JA1005 and JA1006 for example Note also that some academic institutions who are carrying out research to quantify the cost to ongoing software maintenance due to the lack of resources such as design documents and systemsoftware comprehension training and resources multiply costs by approx 1520 where there is no design data available Maintenance Factors edit Impact of key adjustment factors on maintenance
