intelligence Related articles List of datasets for machinelearning research Outline of machine learning v t e Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning statistics and database systems 1 Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information with intelligent methods from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use 1 2 3 4 Data mining is the analysis step of the knowledge discovery in databases process or KDD 5 Aside from the raw analysis step it also involves database and data management aspects data preprocessing model and inference considerations interestingness metrics complexity considerations postprocessing of discovered structures visualization and online updating 1 The term data mining is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data not the extraction mining of data itself 6 It also is a buzzword 7 and is frequently applied to any form of largescale data or information processing collection extraction warehousing analysis and statistics as well as any application of computer decision support system including artificial intelligence eg machine learning and business intelligence The book Data mining Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java 8 which covers mostly machine learning material was originally to be named just Practical machine learning and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons 9 Often the more general terms large scale data analysis and analytics or when referring to actual methods artificial intelligence and machine learning are more appropriate The actual data mining task is the semiautomatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown interesting patterns such as groups of data records cluster analysis unusual records anomaly detection and dependencies association rule mining sequential pattern mining This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data and may be used in further analysis or for example in machine learning and predictive analytics For example the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system Neither the data collection data preparation nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step but do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset eg analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign regardless of the amount of data in contrast data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data 10 The related terms data dredging data fishing and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are or may be too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered These methods can however be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations Contents 1 Etymology 2 Background 3 Process 31 Preprocessing 32 Data mining 33 Results validation 4 Research 5 Standards 6 Notable uses 7 Privacy

like data fishing or data dredging to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an apriori hypothesis The term data mining was used in a similarly critical way by economist Michael Lovell in an article published in the Review of Economic Studies in 1983 11 12 Lovell indicates that the practice masquerades under a variety of aliases ranging from experimentation positive to fishing or snooping negative The term data mining appeared around 1990 in the database community generally with positive connotations For a short time in 1980s a phrase database mining was used but since it was trademarked by HNC a San Diegobased company to pitch their Database Mining Workstation 13 researchers consequently turned to data mining Other terms used include data archaeology information harvesting information discovery knowledge extraction etc Gregory PiatetskyShapiro coined the term knowledge discovery in databases for the first workshop on the same topic KDD1989 and this term became more popular in AI and machine learning community However the term data mining became more popular in the business and press communities 14 Currently the terms data mining and knowledge discovery are used interchangeably In the academic community the major forums for research started in 1995 when the First International Conference on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery KDD95 was started in Montreal under AAAI sponsorship It was cochaired by Usama Fayyad and Ramasamy Uthurusamy A year later in 1996 Usama Fayyad launched the journal by Kluwer called Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery as its founding editorinchief Later he started the SIGKDD Newsletter SIGKDD Explorations 15 The KDD International conference became the primary highest quality conference in data mining with an acceptance rate of research paper submissions below 18 The journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery is the primary research journal of the field Background edit The manual extraction of patterns from data has occurred for centuries Early methods of identifying patterns in data include Bayes theorem 1700s and regression analysis 1800s The proliferation ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology have dramatically increased data collection storage and manipulation ability As data sets have grown in size and complexity direct handson data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect automated data processing aided by other discoveries in computer science specially in the field of machine learning such as neural networks cluster analysis genetic algorithms 1950s decision trees and decision rules 1960s and support vector machines 1990s Data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns 16 in large data sets It bridges the gap from applied statistics and artificial intelligence which usually provide the mathematical background to database management by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently allowing such methods to be applied to everlarger data sets Process edit The knowledge discovery in databases KDD process is commonly defined with the stages Selection Preprocessing Transformation Data mining Interpretationevaluation 5 It exists however in many variations on this theme such as the Crossindustry standard process for data mining CRISPDM which defines six phases Business understanding Data understanding Data preparation Modeling Evaluation Deployment or a simplified process such as 1 Preprocessing 2 Data Mining and 3 Results Validation Polls conducted in 2002 2004 2007 and 2014 show that the CRISPDM methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners 17 The only other data mining standard named in these polls was SEMMA However 34 times as many people reported using CRISPDM Several teams of researchers have published reviews of data mining process models 18 and Azevedo and Santos conducted a comparison of CRISPDM and SEMMA in 2008 19 Preprocessing edit Before data mining algorithms can be used a target data set must be assembled As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit A common source for data is a data mart or data warehouse Preprocessing is essential to analyze the multivariate data sets before data mining The target set is then cleaned Data cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing data Data mining edit Data mining involves six common classes of tasks 5 Anomaly detection outlierchangedeviation detection The identification of unusual data records that might be interesting or data errors that require further investigation Association rule learning dependency modeling Searches for relationships between variables For example a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits Using association rule learning the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes This is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis Clustering is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another similar without using known structures in the data Classification is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data For example an email program might attempt to classify an email as legitimate or as spam Regression attempts to find a function that models the data with the least error that is for estimating the relationships among data or datasets Summarization providing a more compact representation of the data set including visualization and report generation Results validation edit An example of data produced by data dredging through a bot operated by statistician Tyler Vigen apparently showing a close link between the best word winning a spelling bee competition and the number of people in the United States killed by venomous spiders The similarity in trends is obviously a coincidence Data mining can unintentionally be misused and can then produce results that appear to be significant but which do not actually predict future behavior and cannot be reproduced on a new sample of data and bear little use Often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper statistical hypothesis testing A simple version of this problem in machine learning is known as overfitting but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a traintest splitwhen applicable at allmay not be sufficient to prevent this from happening 20 This section is missing information about nonclassification tasks in data mining It only covers machine learning Please expand the section to include this information Further details may exist on the talk page September 2011 The final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set Not all patterns found by data mining algorithms are necessarily valid It is common for data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set This is called overfitting To overcome this the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained The learned patterns are applied to this test set and the resulting output is compared to the desired output For example a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish spam from legitimate emails would be trained on a training set of sample emails Once trained the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of emails on which it had not been trained The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many emails they correctly classify Several statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm such as ROC curves If the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards subsequently it is necessary to reevaluate and change the preprocessing and data mining steps If the learned patterns do meet the desired standards then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge Research edit The premier professional body in the field is the Association for Computing Machinery s ACM Special Interest Group SIG on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining SIGKDD 21 22 Since 1989 this ACM SIG has hosted an annual international conference and published its proceedings 23 and since 1999 it has published a biannual academic journal titled SIGKDD Explorations 24 Computer science conferences on data mining include CIKM Conference ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases KDD Conference ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Data mining topics are also present on many data managementdatabase conferences such as the ICDE Conference SIGMOD Conference and International Conference on Very Large Data Bases Standards edit There have been some efforts to define standards for the data mining process for example the 1999 European Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining CRISPDM 10 and the 2004 Java Data Mining standard JDM 10 Development on successors to these processes CRISPDM 20 and JDM 20 was active in 2006 but has stalled since JDM 20 was withdrawn without reaching a final draft For exchanging the extracted models in particular for use in predictive analytics the key standard is the Predictive Model Markup Language PMML which is an XML based language developed by the Data Mining Group DMG and supported as exchange format by many data mining applications As the name suggests it only covers prediction models a particular data mining task of high importance to business applications However extensions to cover for example subspace clustering have been proposed independently of the DMG 25 Notable uses edit Main article Examples of data mining See also CategoryApplied data mining Data mining is used wherever there is digital data available today Notable examples of data mining can be found throughout business medicine science and surveillance Privacy concerns and ethics edit While the term data mining itself may have no ethical implications it is often associated with the mining of information in relation to peoples behavior ethical and otherwise 26 The ways in which data mining can be used can in some cases and contexts raise questions regarding privacy legality and ethics 27 In particular data mining government or commercial data sets for national security or law enforcement purposes such as in the Total Information Awareness Program or in ADVISE has raised privacy concerns 28 29 Data mining requires data preparation which uncovers information or patterns which compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations A common way for this to occur is through data aggregation Data aggregation involves combining data together possibly from various sources in a way that facilitates analysis but that also might make identification of private individuallevel data deducible or otherwise apparent 30 This is not data mining per se but a result of the preparation of data before and for the purposes of the analysis The threat to an individuals privacy comes into play when the data once compiled cause the data miner or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set to be able to identify specific individuals especially when the data were originally anonymous 31 32 33 It is recommended according to whom to be aware of the following before data are collected 30 the purpose of the data collection and any known data mining projects how the data will be used who will be able to mine the data and use the data and their derivatives the status of security surrounding access to the data how collected data can be updated Data may also be modified so as to become anonymous so that individuals may not readily be identified 30 However even anonymized data sets can potentially contain enough information to allow identification of individuals as occurred when journalists were able to find several individuals based on a set of search histories that were inadvertently released by AOL 34 The inadvertent revelation of personally identifiable information leading to the provider violates Fair Information Practices This indiscretion can cause financialemotional or bodily harm to the indicated individual In one instance of privacy violation the patrons of Walgreens filed a lawsuit against the company in 2011 for sellingprescription information to data mining companies who in turn provided the datato pharmaceutical companies 35 Situation in Europe edit Europe has rather strong privacy laws and efforts are underway to further strengthen the rights of the consumers However the USEU Safe Harbor Principles currently effectively expose European users to privacy exploitation by US companies As a consequence of Edward Snowden s global surveillance disclosure there has been increased discussion to revoke this agreement as in particular the data will be fully exposed to the National Security Agency and attempts to reach an agreement have failed citation needed Situation in the United States edit In the United States privacy concerns have been addressed by the US Congress via the passage of regulatory controls such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA The HIPAA requires individuals to give their informed consent regarding information they provide and its intended present and future uses According to an article in Biotech Business Week in practice HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena says the AAHC More importantly the rules goal of protection through informed consent is approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individuals 36 This underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices US information privacy legislation such as HIPAA and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act FERPA applies only to the specific areas that each such law addresses The use of data mining by the majority of businesses in the US is not controlled by any legislation Copyright law edit Situation in Europe edit Under European copyright and database laws the mining of incopyright works such as by web mining without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal Where a database is pure data in Europe it may be that there is no copyright but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject to intellectual property owners rights that are protected by the Database Directive On the recommendation of the Hargreaves review this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014 to allow content mining as a limitation and exception 37 The UK was the second country in the world to do so after Japan which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining However due to the restriction of the Information Society Directive 2001 the UK exception only allows content mining for noncommercial purposes UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions The European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013 under the title of Licences for Europe 38 The focus on the solution to this legal issue such as licensing rather than limitations and exceptions led to representatives of universities researchers libraries civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013 39 Situation in the United States edit US copyright law and in particular its provision for fair use means that content mining in America as well as other fair use countries such as Israel Taiwan and South Korea is viewed as being legal As content mining is transformative that is it does not supplant the original work it is viewed as being lawful under fair use For example as part of the Google Book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that Googles digitisation project of incopyright books was lawful in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed one being text and data mining 40 Software edit See also CategoryData mining and machine learning software Free opensource data mining software and
