guidance of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University in Prague In 1997 Roman Staněk formed a company around the project and produced commercial versions of the NetBeans IDE until it was bought by Sun Microsystems in 1999 Sun opensourced the NetBeans IDE in June of the following year Since then the NetBeans community has continued to grow 8 In 2010 Sun and thus NetBeans was acquired by Oracle Corporation Under Oracle NetBeans competed with JDeveloper a freeware IDE that has historically been a product of the company In September 2016 Oracle submitted a proposal to donate the NetBeans project to the Apache Software Foundation stating that it was opening up the NetBeans governance model to give NetBeans constituents a greater voice in the projects direction and future success through the upcoming release of Java 9 and NetBeans 9 and beyond The move was endorsed by Java creator James Gosling 9 The project entered the Apache Incubator in October 2016 10 NetBeans IDE

in November 2008 extended the existing Java EE features including Java Persistence support EJB 3 and JAXWS Additionally the NetBeans Enterprise Pack supports the development of Java EE 5 enterprise applications including SOA visual design tools XML schema tools web services orchestration for BPEL and UML modeling The NetBeans IDE Bundle for CC supports CC and FORTRAN development NetBeans IDE 68 is the first IDE to provide complete support of Java EE 6 and the GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Developers hosting their opensource projects on kenaicom additionally benefit from instant messaging and issue tracking integration and navigation right in the IDE support for web application development with PHP 53 and the Symfony framework and improved code completion layouts hints and navigation in JavaFX projects NetBeans IDE 69 released in June 2010 added support for OSGi Spring Framework 30 Java EE dependency injection JSR299 Zend Framework for PHP and easier code navigation such as Is OverriddenImplemented annotations formatting hints and refactoring across several languages NetBeans IDE 70 was released in April 2011 On August 1 2011 the NetBeans Team released NetBeans IDE 701

NetBeans 110 was released on 4 April 2019 NetBeans 111 was released on 22 July 2019 NetBeans platform edit The NetBeans Platform is a framework for simplifying the development of Swing desktop applications The NetBeans IDE bundle for Java SE contains what is needed to start developing NetBeans plugins and NetBeans Platform based applications no additional SDK is required Applications can install modules dynamically Any application can include the Update Center module to allow users of the application to download digitally signed upgrades and new features directly into the running application Reinstalling an upgrade or a new release does not force users to download the entire application again The platform offers reusable services common to desktop applications allowing developers to focus on the logic specific to their application Among the features of the platform are User interface management eg menus and toolbars User settings management Storage management carries out efficient storage Window management Wizard framework supports stepbystep dialogs NetBeans Visual Library Integrated development tools A showcase of applications developed on top of NetBeans Platform is available at httpsnetbeansorgfeaturesplatformshowcasehtml NetBeans IDE edit NetBeans IDE is an opensource integrated development environment NetBeans IDE supports development of all Java application types Java SE including JavaFX Java ME web EJB and mobile applications out of the box Among other features are an Ant based project system Maven support refactorings version control supporting CVS Subversion Git Mercurial and Clearcase Modularity All the functions of the IDE are provided by modules Each module provides a welldefined function such as support for the Java language editing or support for the CVS versioning system and SVN NetBeans contains all the modules needed for Java development in a single download allowing the user to start working immediately Modules also allow NetBeans to be extended New features such as support for other programming languages can be added by installing additional modules For instance Sun Studio Sun Java Studio Enterprise and Sun Java Studio Creator from Sun Microsystems are all based on the NetBeans IDE License The IDE is licensed under the Apache License 20 Previously from July 2006 through 2007 NetBeans IDE was licensed under Suns Common Development and Distribution License CDDL a license based on the Mozilla Public License MPL In October 2007 Sun announced that NetBeans would henceforth be offered under a dual license of the CDDL and the GPL version 2 licenses with the GPL linking exception for GNU Classpath 16 Oracle has donated NetBeans Platform and IDE to the Apache Foundation where it underwent incubation and graduated as a top level project in April 2019 17 Other products edit In an October 2016 interview with Gabriela Motroc Oracle Vice President Bill Pataky stated that Oracle has a number of products that depend on NetBeans 18 Oracle Developer Studio a commercial C C Fortran and Java development environment is 100 based on NetBeans 18 Oracle JDeveloper an endtoend development for Oracles technology stack takes major subsystems from NetBeans 18 Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit a modular open source toolkit based on modern JavaScript CSS3 and HTML5 design and development principles uses NetBeans as its preferred IDE 18 Alternative distributions edit CoolBeans edit In 2018 while NetBeans was still in the Apache incubator an alternative NetBeans distribution called CoolBeans 19 was independently launched 20 CoolBeans offered an installer for Windows native application for macOS included a Java Development Kit native modules for system notifications as well as some Java Enterprise modules Integrated Modules edit These modules are part of the NetBeans IDE NetBeans Profiler edit The NetBeans Profiler 21 is a tool for the monitoring of Java applications It helps developers find memory leaks and optimize speed Formerly downloaded separately it is integrated into the core IDE since version 60The Profiler is based on a Sun Laboratories research project that was named JFluid That research uncovered specific techniques that can be used to lower the overhead of profiling a Java application One of those techniques is dynamic bytecode instrumentation which is particularly useful for profiling large Java applications Using dynamic bytecode instrumentation and additional algorithms the NetBeans Profiler is able to obtain runtime information on applications that are too large or complex for other profilers NetBeans also support Profiling Points that let you profile precise points of execution and measure execution time GUI design tool edit NetBeans GUI Builder Formerly known as project Matisse the GUI designtool enables developers to prototype and design Swing GUIs by dragging and positioning GUI components 22 The GUI builder has builtin support for JSR 295 Beans Binding technology but the support for JSR 296 Swing Application Framework was removed in 71 NetBeans JavaScript editor edit The NetBeans JavaScript editor provides extended support for JavaScript Ajax and CSS 23 24 JavaScript editor features comprise syntax highlighting refactoring code completion for native objects and functions generation of JavaScript class skeletons generation of Ajax callbacks from a template and automatic browser compatibility checks CSS editor features comprise code completion for styles names quick navigation through the navigator panel displaying the CSS rule declaration in a List View and file structure in a Tree View sorting the outline view by name type or declaration order List Tree creating rule declarations Tree only refactoring a part of a rule name Tree only The NetBeans 74 and later uses the new Nashorn JavaScript engine developed by Oracle NetBeans IDE Download Bundles edit Users can choose to download NetBeans IDE bundles tailored to specific development needs Users can also download and install all other features at a later date directly through the NetBeans IDE NetBeans IDE Bundle for Web and
