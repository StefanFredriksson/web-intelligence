edit Draughts is played by two opponents on opposite sides of the gameboard One player has the dark pieces the other has the light pieces Players alternate turns A player may not move an opponents piece A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square If the adjacent square contains an opponents piece and the square immediately beyond it is vacant the piece may be captured and removed from the game by jumping over it Only the dark squares of the checkered board are used A piece may move only diagonally into an unoccupied square When presented capturing is mandatory in most official rules although some rule variations make capturing optional 3 In almost all variants the player without pieces remaining or who cannot move due to being blocked loses the game Men edit Uncrowned pieces men move one step diagonally forwards and capture an opponents piece by moving two consecutive steps in the same line jumping over the piece on the first step Multiple enemy pieces can be captured in a single turn provided this is done by successive jumps made by a single piece the jumps do not need to be in the same line and may zigzag change diagonal direction In English draughts men can jump only forwards in international draughts and Russian draughts men can jump both forwards and backwards Kings edit A game in international draughts featuring a flying king When a man reaches the kings row also called crownhead the farthest row forward it becomes a king and is marked by placing an additional piece on top of the first man and acquires additional powers including the ability to move backwards and in variants where they cannot already do so capture backwards Like men a king can make successive jumps in a single turn provided that each jump captures an enemy man or king In international draughts kings also called flying kings move any distance along unblocked diagonals and may capture an opposing man any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it Because jumped pieces remain on the board until the turn is complete it is possible to reach a position in a multijump move where the flying king is blocked from capturing further by a piece already jumped Flying kings are not used in English draughts a kings only advantage over a man is the ability to move and capture backwards as well as forwards Naming edit In most nonEnglish languages except those that acquired the game from English speakers draughts is called dame dames damas or a similar term that refers to ladies The pieces are usually called men stones peón pawn or a similar term men promoted to kings are called dames or ladies In these languages the queen in chess or in card games is usually called by the same term as the kings in draughts A case in point includes the Greek terminology in which draughts is called ντάμα dama which is also one term for the queen in chess National and regional variants edit Starting position in

since the beginning of the XIX century in which the game is played according to the usual rules of draughts but with the difference that the beaten draught is not removed from the playing field and is captured under the beating figure draught or tower The resulting towers move around the Board as a whole obeying the upper draught When taking the tower only the upper draught is removed from it If on the top there is a draught of other color than removed as a result of fight the tower becomes a tower of the rival Rules of moves of draughts and kings correspond to the rules of Russian draughts

checkers History edit Ancient games edit A similar game has been played for millennia 2 A board resembling a draughts board was found in Ur dating from 3000 BC 5 In the British Museum are specimens of ancient Egyptian checkerboards found with their pieces in burial chambers and the game was played by Queen Hatasu 2 6 Plato mentioned a game πεττεία or petteia as being of Egyptian origin 6 and Homer also mentions it 6 The method of capture was placing two pieces on either side of the opponents piece It was said to have been played during the Trojan War 7 8 The Romans played a derivation of petteia called latrunculi or the game of the Little Soldiers The pieces and sporadically the game itself were called calculi pebbles 6 9 Alquerque edit Main article Alquerque Alquerque board and setup An Arabic game called Quirkat or alqirq with similar play to modern draughts was played on a 55 board It is mentioned in the 10thcentury work Kitab alAghani 5 Al qirq was also the name for the game that is now called nine mens morris 10 Al qirq was brought to Spain by the Moors 11 where it became known as Alquerque the Spanish derivation of the Arabic name The rules are given in the 13thcentury book Libro de los juegos 5 In about 1100 probably in the south of France the game of Alquerque was adapted using backgammon pieces on a chessboard 12 Each piece was called a fers the same name as the chess queen as the move of the two pieces was the same at the time 13 Crowning edit Men in medieval clothing playing draughts The rule of crowning was used by the 13th century as it is mentioned in the Philip Mouskats Chronique in 1243 5 when the game was known as Fierges the name used for the chess queen derived from the Persian ferz meaning royal counsellor or vizier The pieces became known as dames when that name was also adopted for the chess queen 13 The rule forcing players to take whenever possible was introduced in France in around 1535 at which point the game became known as Jeu forcé identical to modern English draughts 5 12 The game without forced capture became known as Le jeu plaisant de dames the precursor of international draughts The 18thcentury English author Samuel Johnson wrote a foreword to a 1756 book about draughts by William Payne the earliest book in English about the game 6 Computer draughts edit Further information English draughts Computer players and International draughts Computers English draughts American 88 checkers has been the arena for several notable advances in game artificial intelligence In the 1950s Arthur Samuel created one of the first board gameplaying programs of any kind More recently in 2007 scientists at the University of Alberta 14 developed their Chinook program to the point where it is unbeatable A brute force approach that took hundreds of computers working nearly two decades was used to solve the game 15 showing that a game of draughts will always end in a draw if neither player makes a mistake 16 17 The solution is for the draughts variation called goasyouplease GAYP checkers and not for the variation called threemove restriction checkers As of December 2007 this makes English draughts the most complex game ever solved Computational complexity edit Generalized Checkers is played on an N N board It is PSPACEhard to determine whether a specified player has a winning strategy And if a polynomial bound is placed on the number of moves that are allowed in between jumps which is a reasonable generalization of the drawing rule in standard Checkers then the problem is in PSPACE thus it is PSPACEcomplete 18 However without this bound Checkers is EXPTIMEcomplete 19 However other problems have only polynomial complexity 18 Can one player remove all the other players pieces in one move by several jumps Can one player king a piece in one move See also edit Fanorona List of draughts players List of Draughts World Championship winners List of Draughts64 World Championship winners List of womens Draughts
