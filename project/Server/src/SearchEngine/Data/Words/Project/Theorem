Theorem Not to be confused with Teorema Theorema or Theory In mathematics a statement that has been proved The Pythagorean theorem has at least 370 known proofs 1 In mathematics a theorem is a nonselfevident statement that has been proven to be true either on the basis of generally accepted statements such as axioms or on the basis previously established statements such as other theorems 2 3 4 A theorem is hence a logical consequence of the axioms with a proof of the theorem being a logical argument which establishes its truth through the inference rules of a deductive system As a result the proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement In light of the requirement that theorems be proved the concept of a theorem is fundamentally deductive in contrast to the notion of a scientific law which is experimental 5 6 Many mathematical theorems are conditional statements whose proof deduces the conclusion from conditions known as hypotheses or premises In light of the interpretation of proof as justification of truth the conclusion is often viewed as a necessary consequence of the hypotheses Namely that the conclusion is true in case the hypotheses are truewithout any further assumptions However the conditional could also be interpreted differently in certain deductive systems depending on the meanings assigned to the derivation rules and the conditional symbol eg nonclassical logic Although theorems can be written in a completely symbolic form eg as propositions in propositional calculus they are often expressed informally in a natural language such as English for better readability The same is true of proofs which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed In addition to the better readability informal arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic onesindeed many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem but also explains in some way why it is obviously true In some cases one might even be able to substantiate a theorem by using a picture as its proof Because theorems lie at the core of mathematics they are also central to its aesthetics Theorems are often described as being trivial or difficult or deep or even beautiful These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person but also with time and culture for example as a proof is obtained simplified or better understood a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial 7 On the other hand a deep theorem may be stated simply but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics Fermats Last Theorem is a particularly wellknown example of such a theorem 8 Contents 1 Informal account of theorems 2 Provability and theoremhood 3 Relation with scientific theories 4 Terminology 5 Layout 6 Lore 7 Theorems in logic 71 Syntax and semantics 72 Derivation of a theorem 73 Interpretation of a formal theorem 74 Theorems and theories 8 See also 9 Notes 10 References 11 External links Informal account of theorems edit Logically many theorems are of the form of an indicative conditional if A then B Such a theorem does not assert B only that B is a necessary consequence of A In this case A is called the hypothesis of the theorem hypothesis here means something very different from a conjecture and B the conclusion of the theorem Alternatively A and B can be also termed the antecedent and the consequent respectively 9 The theorem If n is an even natural number then n 2 is a natural number is a typical example in which the hypothesis is n is an even natural number and the conclusion is n 2 is also a natural number In order for a theorem be proved it must be in principle expressible as a precise formal statement However theorems are usually expressed in natural language rather than in a completely symbolic formwith the presumption that a formal statement can be derived from the informal one It is common in mathematics to choose a number of hypotheses within a given language and declare that the theory consists of all statements provable from these hypotheses These hypotheses form the foundational basis of the theory and are called axioms or postulates The field of mathematics known as proof theory studies formal languages axioms and the structure of proofs A planar map with five colors such that no two regions with the same color meet It can actually be colored in this way with only four colors The four color theorem states that such colorings are possible for any planar map but every known proof involves a computational search that is too long to check by hand Some theorems are trivial in the sense that they follow from definitions axioms and other theorems in obvious ways and do not contain any surprising insights 10 Some on the other hand may be called deep because their proofs may be long and difficult involve areas of mathematics superficially distinct from the statement of the theorem itself or show surprising connections between disparate areas of mathematics 11 A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep An excellent example is Fermats Last Theorem 8 and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in number theory and combinatorics among other areas Other theorems have a known proof that cannot easily be written down The most prominent examples are the four color theorem and the Kepler conjecture Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search that is then verified by a computer program Initially many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof but it has become more widely accepted The mathematician Doron Zeilberger has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved 12 Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation including polynomial identities trigonometric identities 13 and hypergeometric identities 14 pageneeded Provability and theoremhood edit To establish a mathematical statement as a theorem a proof is required That is a valid line of reasoning from the axioms and other alreadyestablished theorems to the given statement must be demonstrated In general the proof is considered to be separate from the theorem statement itself This is in part because while more than one proof may be known for a single theorem only one proof is required to establish the status of a statement as a theorem The Pythagorean theorem and the law of quadratic reciprocity are contenders for the title of theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs 15 16 Relation with scientific theories edit This section does not cite any sources

how and when to remove this template message Theorems in mathematics and theories in science are fundamentally different in their epistemology A scientific theory cannot be proved its key attribute is that it is falsifiable that is it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable by experiments Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity Mathematical theorems on the other hand are purely abstract formal statements the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories 5 The Collatz conjecture one way to illustrate its complexity is to extend the iteration from the natural numbers to the complex numbers The result is a fractal which in accordance with universality resembles the Mandelbrot set Nonetheless there is some degree of empiricism and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems By establishing a pattern sometimes with the use of a powerful computer mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof For example the Collatz conjecture has been verified for start values up to about 28810 18 The Riemann hypothesis has been verified for the first 10 trillion zeroes of the zeta function Neither of these statements is considered proved Such evidence does not constitute proof For example the Mertens conjecture is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false but no explicit counterexample ie a natural number n for which the Mertens function M n equals or exceeds the square root of n is known all numbers less than 10 14 have the Mertens property and the smallest number that does not have this property is only known to be less than the exponential of 15910 40 which is approximately 10 to the power 4310 39 Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 a googol there is no hope to find an explicit counterexample by exhaustive search The word theory also exists in mathematics to denote a body of mathematical axioms definitions and theorems as in for example group theory see mathematical theory There are also theorems in science particularly physics and in engineering but they often have statements and proofs in which physical assumptions and intuition play an important role the physical axioms on which such theorems are based are themselves falsifiable Terminology edit A number of different terms for mathematical statements exist these terms indicate the role statements play in a particular subject The distinction between different terms is sometimes rather arbitrary and the usage of some terms has evolved over time An axiom or postulate is a statement that is accepted without proof and regarded as fundamental to a subject Historically these have been regarded as selfevident but more recently they are considered assumptions that characterize the subject of study In classical geometry axioms are general statements while postulates are statements about geometrical objects 17 A definition is yet another form of statement that is also accepted without proofsince it simply gives the meaning of a word or phrase in terms of known concepts An unproved statement that is believed true is called a conjecture or sometimes a hypothesis but with a different meaning from the one discussed above To be considered a conjecture a statement must usually be proposed publicly at which point the name of the proponent may be attached to the conjecture as with Goldbachs conjecture Other famous conjectures include the Collatz conjecture and the Riemann hypothesis On the other hand Fermats Last Theorem has always been known by that name even before it was proved it was never known as Fermats conjecture A proposition is a theorem of lesser importance This term sometimes connotes a statement with a simple proof while the term theorem is usually reserved for the most important results or those with long or difficult proofs Some authors never use proposition while some others use theorem only for fundamental results In classical geometry this term was used differently In Euclids Elements c 300 BCE all theorems and geometric constructions were called propositions regardless of their importance A lemma is a helping theorem a proposition with little applicability except that it forms part of the proof of a larger theorem In some cases as the relative importance of different theorems becomes more clear what was once considered a lemma is now considered a theorem though the word lemma remains in the name Examples include Gausss lemma Zorns lemma and the fundamental lemma A corollary is a proposition that follows with little proof from another theorem or definition 18 Also a corollary can be a theorem restated for a more restricted special case For example the theorem that all angles in a rectangle are right angles has as corollary that all angles in a square a special case of a rectangle are right angles A converse of a theorem is a statement formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and what is to be proved For example the isosceles triangle theorem states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two angles are equal In the converse the given that two sides are equal and what is to be proved that two angles are equal are swapped so the converse is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then two sides are equal In this example the converse can be proved as another theorem but this is often not the case For example the converse to the theorem that two right angles are equal angles is the statement that two equal angles must be right angles and this is clearly not always the case 19 A generalization is a theorem which includes a previously proved theorem as a special case and hence as a corollary There are other terms less commonly used that are conventionally attached to proved statements so that certain theorems are referred to by historical or customary names For example An identity is an equality contained in a theorem between two mathematical expressions that holds regardless of the values being used for any variables or parameters appearing in the expressions as long as they are within the range of validity 20 Examples include Eulers formula and Vandermondes identity A rule is a theorem such as Bayes rule and Cramers rule that establishes a useful formula A law or a principle is a theorem that applies in a wide range of circumstances Examples include the law of large numbers the law of cosines Kolmogorovs zeroone law Harnacks principle the leastupperbound principle and the pigeonhole principle 21 A few wellknown theorems have even more idiosyncratic names The division algorithm see Euclidean division is a theorem expressing the outcome of division in the natural numbers and more general rings Bézouts identity is a theorem asserting that the greatest common divisor of two numbers may be written as a linear combination of these numbers The BanachTarski paradox is a theorem in measure theory that is paradoxical in the sense that it contradicts common intuitions about volume in threedimensional space Layout edit A theorem and its proof are typically laid out as follows Theorem name of the person who proved it along with year of discovery or publication of the proof Statement of theorem sometimes called the proposition Proof Description of proof End The end of the proof may be signaled by the letters QED quod erat demonstrandum or by one of the tombstone marks or meaning End of Proof introduced by Paul Halmos following their usage in magazine articles 22 The exact style depends on the author or publication Many publications provide instructions or macros for typesetting in the house style It is common for a theorem to be preceded by definitions describing the exact meaning of the terms used in the theorem It is also common for a theorem to be preceded by a number of propositions or lemmas which are then used in the proof However lemmas are sometimes embedded in the proof of a theorem either with nested proofs or with their proofs presented after the proof of the theorem Corollaries to a theorem are either presented between the theorem and the proof or directly after the proof Sometimes corollaries have proofs of their own that explain why they follow from the theorem Lore edit It has been estimated that over a quarter of a million theorems are proved every year 23 The wellknown aphorism A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems is probably due to Alfréd Rényi although it is often attributed to Rényis colleague Paul Erdős and Rényi may have been thinking of Erdős who was famous for the many theorems he produced the number of his collaborations and his coffee drinking 24 The classification of finite simple groups is regarded by some to be the longest proof of a theorem It comprises tens of thousands of pages in 500 journal articles by some 100 authors These papers are together believed to give a complete proof and several ongoing projects hope to shorten and simplify this proof 25 Another theorem of this type is the four color theorem whose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read It is certainly among one of the longest known proofs of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman Theorems in logic edit This section needs

books scholar JSTOR October 2010 Learn how and when to remove this template message Logic especially in the field of proof theory considers theorems as statements called formulas or well formed formulas of a formal language The statements of the language are strings of symbols and may be broadly divided into nonsense and wellformed formulas A set of deduction rules also called transformation rules or rules of inference must be provided These deduction rules tell exactly when a formula can be derived from a set of premises The set of wellformed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and nontheorems However according to Hofstadter a formal system often simply defines all its wellformed formula as theorems 26 pageneeded Different sets of derivation rules give rise to different interpretations of what it means for an expression to be a theorem Some derivation rules and formal languages are intended to capture mathematical reasoning the most common examples use firstorder logic Other deductive systems describe term rewriting such as the reduction rules for λ calculus The definition of theorems as elements of a formal language allows for results in proof theory that study the structure of formal proofs and the structure of provable formulas The most famous result is Gödels incompleteness theorems by representing theorems about basic number theory as expressions in a formal language and then representing this language within number theory itself Gödel constructed examples of statements that are neither provable nor disprovable from axiomatizations of number theory This diagram shows the syntactic entities that can be constructed from formal languages The symbols and strings of symbols may be broadly divided into nonsense and wellformed formulas A formal language can be thought of as identical to the set of its wellformed formulas The set of wellformed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and nontheorems A theorem may be expressed in a formal language or formalized A formal theorem is the purely formal analogue of a theorem In general a formal theorem is a type of wellformed formula that satisfies certain logical and syntactic conditions The notation displaystyle vdash S displaystyle S is often used to indicate that S displaystyle S is a theorem Formal theorems consist of formulas of a formal language and the transformation rules of a formal system Specifically a formal theorem is always the last formula of a derivation in some formal system each formula of which is a logical consequence of the formulas that came before it in the derivation The initiallyaccepted formulas in the derivation are called its axioms and are the basis on which the theorem is derived A set of theorems is called a theory What makes formal theorems useful and interesting is that they can be interpreted as true propositions and their derivations may be interpreted as a proof of the truth of the resulting expression A set of formal theorems may be referred to as a formal theory A theorem whose interpretation is a true statement about a formal system as opposed to of a formal system is called a metatheorem Syntax and semantics edit Main articles Syntax logic and Formal semantics logic The concept of a formal theorem is fundamentally syntactic in contrast to the notion of a true proposition which introduces semantics Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules ie belief justification or other modalities The soundness of a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also validities A validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation for example in classical propositional logic validities are tautologies A formal system is considered semantically complete when all of its theorems are also tautologies Derivation of a theorem edit Main article Formal proof The notion of a theorem is very closely connected to its formal proof also called a derivation As an illustration consider a very simplified formal system F S displaystyle mathcal FS whose alphabet consists of only two symbols A B and whose formation rule for formulas is Any string of symbols of F S displaystyle mathcal FS that is at least three symbols long and is not infinitely long is a formula Nothing else is a formula The single axiom of F S displaystyle mathcal FS is ABBA The only rule of inference transformation rule for F S displaystyle mathcal FS is Any occurrence of A in a theorem may be replaced by an occurrence of the string AB and the result is a theorem Theorems in F S displaystyle mathcal FS are defined as those formulas that have a derivation ending with it For example ABBA Given as axiom ABBBA by applying the transformation rule ABBBAB by applying the transformation rule is a derivation Therefore ABBBAB is a theorem of F S displaystyle mathcal FS The notion of truth or falsity cannot be applied to the formula ABBBAB until an interpretation is given to its symbols Thus in this example the formula does not yet represent a proposition but is merely an empty abstraction Two metatheorems of F S displaystyle mathcal FS
