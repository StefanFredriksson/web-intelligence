of personalization is the increasing prevalence of open data on the Web Many companies make their data available on the Web via APIs web services and open data standards One such example is Ordnance Survey Open Data 1 Data made available in this way is structured to allow it to be interconnected and reused by third parties 2 Data available from a users personal social graph can be accessed by

rarely simply accommodation of the user but a relationship between the user and the desires of the site designers in driving specific actions to achieve objectives eg Increase sales conversion on a page The term customization is often used when the site only uses explicit data such as product ratings or user preferences Technically web personalization can be achieved by associating a visitor segment with a predefined action Customizing the user experience based on behavioural contextual and technical data is proven to have a positive impact on conversion rate optimization efforts Associated actions can range from changing the content of a webpage presenting a modal display presenting interstitials triggering a personalized email or even automating a phone call to the user

personalization as well as web and email recommendation systems that are based on personalization or anonymouslycollected user behaviours 3 There are many categories of web personalization including Behavioral Contextual Technical Historic data Collaboratively filtered There are several camps in defining and executing web personalization A few broad methods for web personalization may include Implicit Explicit Hybrid With implicit personalization the web personalization is performed based on the different categories mentioned above It can also be learned from direct interactions with the user based on implicit data such as items purchased or pages viewed 4 With explicit personalization the web page or information system is changed by the user using the features provided by the system Hybrid personalization combines the above two approaches to leverage the best of both worlds Web personalization is can be linked to the notion of Adaptive hypermedia AH The main difference is that the former would usually work on what is considered an open corpus hypermedia whilst the latter would traditionally work on closed corpus hypermedia However recent research directions in the AH domain take both closed and open corpus into account Thus the two fields are closely interrelated Personalization is also being considered for use in less overtly commercial applications to improve the user experience online 5 Internet activist Eli Pariser has documented that search engines like Google and Yahoo News give different results to different people even when logged out He also points out social media site Facebook changes users friend feeds based on what it thinks they want to see Pariser warns that these algorithms can create a filter bubble that prevents people from encountering a diversity of viewpoints beyond their own or which only presents facts which confirm their existing views On an intranet or B2E Enterprise Web portals personalization is often based on user attributes

merchandise edit Main article Mail merge In print media ranging from magazines to promotional publications personalization uses databases of individual recipients information Not only does the written document address itself by name to the reader but the advertising is targeted to the recipients demographics or interests using fields within the database such as first name last name company etc The term personalization should not be confused with variable data which is a much more granular method of marketing that leverages both images and text with the medium not just fields within a database

suggestions January 2011 Learn how and when to remove this template message Mass personalization is defined as custom tailoring by a company in accordance with its end users tastes and preferences 12 From collaborative engineering perspective mass customization can be viewed as collaborative efforts between customers and manufacturers who have different sets of priorities and need to jointly search for solutions that best match customers individual specific needs with manufacturers customization capabilities 13 14 The main difference between mass customization and mass personalization is that customization is the ability for a company to give its customers an opportunity to create and choose product to certain specifications but does have limits 15 One example of mass personalization A website knowing a users location and buying habits will offer suggestions tailored to that users demographics Each user is classified by some relevant trait location age and so forth and then given personalization aimed at that group This means that the personalization is not individual to that singular user it only pinpoints a specific trait that matches them up with a larger group of people 16 Behavioral targeting represents a concept that is similar to mass personalization Predictive personalization edit Predictive personalization is defined as the ability to predict customer behavior needs or wants and tailor offers and communications very precisely 17 Social data is one source of providing this predictive analysis particularly social data that is structured Predictive
