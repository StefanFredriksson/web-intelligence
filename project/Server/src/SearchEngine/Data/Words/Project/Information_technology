used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies 2 IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology ICT An information technology system IT system is generally an information system a communications system or more specifically speaking a computer system including all hardware software and peripheral equipment operated by a limited group of users Humans have been storing retrieving manipulating and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000BC 3 but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review authors Harold J Leavitt and Thomas L Whisler commented that the new technology does not yet have a single established name We shall call it information technology IT Their definition consists of three categories techniques for processing the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decisionmaking and the simulation of higherorder thinking through computer programs 4 The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology including computer hardware software electronics semiconductors internet telecom equipment and ecommerce 5 a Based on the storage and processing technologies employed it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development premechanical 3000BC 1450AD mechanical 14501840 electromechanical 18401940 and electronic 1940present 3 This article focuses on the most recent period electronic Contents 1 History

display at Deutsches Museum in Munich The Zuse Z3 is the first programmable computer Main article History of computing hardware Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years probably initially in the form of a tally stick 7 The Antikythera mechanism dating from about the beginning of the first century BC is generally considered to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer and the earliest known geared mechanism 8 Comparable geared devices did not emerge in Europe until the 16th century and it was not until 1645 that the first mechanical calculator capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed 9 Electronic computers using either relays or valves began to appear in the early 1940s The electromechanical Zuse Z3 completed in 1941 was the worlds first programmable computer and by modern standards one of the first machines that could be considered a complete computing machine Colossus developed during the Second World War to decrypt German messages was the first electronic digital computer Although it was programmable it was not generalpurpose being designed to perform only a single task It also lacked the ability to store its program in memory programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring 10 The first recognisably modern electronic digital storedprogram computer was the Manchester Baby which ran its first program on 21 June 1948 11 The development of transistors in the late 1940s at Bell Laboratories allowed a new generation of computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption The first commercially available storedprogram computer the Ferranti Mark I contained 4050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts By comparison the first transistorised computer developed at the University of Manchester and operational by November 1953 consumed only 150 watts in its final version 12 Several later breakthroughs in semiconductor technology include the integrated circuit IC invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959 the metaloxidesemiconductor fieldeffect transistor MOSFET invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Laboratories in 1959 and the microprocessor invented by Ted Hoff Federico Faggin Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel in 1971 These important inventions led to the development of the personal computer PC in the 1970s and the emergence of information and communications technology ICT 13 Electronic data processing edit Main article Electronic data processing Data storage edit Punched tapes were used in early computers to represent data Main article Data storage device Early electronic computers such as Colossus made use of punched tape a long strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes a technology now obsolete 14 Electronic data storage which is used in modern computers dates from World War II when a form of delay line memory was developed to remove the clutter from radar signals the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line 15 The first randomaccess digital storage device was the Williams tube based on a standard cathode ray tube 16 but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed and thus was lost once power was removed The earliest form of nonvolatile computer storage was the magnetic drum invented in 1932 17 and used in the Ferranti Mark 1 the worlds first commercially available generalpurpose electronic computer 18 IBM introduced the first hard disk drive in 1956 as a component of their 305 RAMAC computer system 19 6 Most digital data today is still stored magnetically on hard disks or optically on media such as CDROMs 20 45 Until 2002 most information was stored on analog devices but that year digital storage capacity exceeded analog for the first time As of 2007 almost 94 of the data stored worldwide was held digitally 21 52 on hard disks 28 on optical devices and 11 on digital magnetic tape It has been estimated that the worldwide capacity to store information on electronic devices grew from less than 3 exabytes in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007 22 doubling roughly every 3 years 23 Databases edit Main article Database Database Management Systems DMS emerged in the 1960s to address the problem of storing and retrieving large amounts of data accurately and quickly An early such systems was IBM s Information Management System IMS 24 which is still widely deployed more than 50 years later 25 IMS stores data hierarchically 24 but in the 1970s Ted Codd proposed an alternative relational storage model based on set theory and predicate logic and the familiar concepts of tables rows and columns In 1981 the first commercially available relational database management system RDBMS was released by Oracle 26 All DMS consist of components they allow the data they store to be accessed simultaneously by many users while maintaining its integrity 27 All databases are common in one point that the structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the data itself in a database schema 24 In recent years the extensible markup language XML has become a popular format for data representation Although XML data can be stored in normal file systems it is commonly held in relational databases to take advantage of their robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical effort 28 As an evolution of the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML XMLs textbased structure offers the advantage of being both machine and humanreadable 29 Data retrieval edit The relational database model introduced a programminglanguage independent Structured Query Language SQL based on relational algebra The terms data and information are not synonymous Anything stored is data but it only becomes information when it is organized and presented meaningfully 30 19 Most of the worlds digital data is unstructured and stored in a variety of different physical formats 31 b even within a single organization Data warehouses began to be developed in the 1980s to integrate these disparate stores They typically contain data extracted from various sources including external sources such as the Internet organized in such a way as to facilitate decision support systems DSS 32 46 Data transmission edit Data transmission has three aspects transmission propagation and reception 33 It can be broadly categorized as broadcasting in which information is transmitted unidirectionally downstream or telecommunications with bidirectional upstream and downstream channels 22 XML has been increasingly employed as a means of data interchange since the early 2000s 34 particularly for machineoriented interactions such as those involved in weboriented protocols such as SOAP 29 describing dataintransit rather than dataatrest 34 Data manipulation edit Hilbert and Lopez identify the exponential pace of technological change a kind of Moores law machines applicationspecific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and 2007 the per capita capacity of the worlds generalpurpose computers doubled every 18 months during the same two decades the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months the worlds storage capacity per capita required roughly 40 months to double every 3 years and per capita broadcast information has doubled every 123 years 22 Massive amounts of data are stored worldwide every day but unless it can be analysed and presented effectively it essentially resides in what have been called data tombs data archives that are seldom visited 35 To address that issue the field of data mining the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data 36 emerged in the late 1980s 37 Perspectives edit Academic perspective edit In an academic context the Association for Computing Machinery defines IT as undergraduate degree programs that prepare students to meet the computer technology needs of business government healthcare schools and other kinds of organizations IT specialists assume responsibility for selecting hardware and software products appropriate for an organization integrating those products with organizational needs and infrastructure and installing customizing and maintaining those applications for the organizations computer users 38 Commercial and employment perspective edit Companies in the information technology field are often discussed as a group as the tech sector or the tech industry 39 40 41 Many companies now have IT departments for managing the computers networks and other technical areas of their businesses In a business context the Information Technology Association of America has defined information technology as the study design development application implementation support or management of computerbased information systems 42 pageneeded The responsibilities of those working in the field include network administration software development and installation and the planning and management of an organizations technology life cycle by which hardware and software are maintained upgraded and replaced US Employment distribution of computer systems design and related services 2011

ethical issues associated with the use of information technology include 45 2021 Breaches of copyright by those downloading files stored without the permission of the copyright holders Employers

application of the term IT Keary comments In its original application information technology was appropriate to describe the convergence of technologies with application in the broad field of data storage retrieval processing and dissemination This useful conceptual term has since been converted to what purports to be concrete use but without the reinforcement of definition the term IT lacks substance when applied to the name of any function discipline or position 6 Format refers to the physical characteristics of the stored data such as its encoding scheme structure describes the organisation of that data Citations edit Daintith John ed 2009 IT A Dictionary of Physics Oxford University Press ISBN 9780199233991 retrieved 1 August 2012 mwparseroutput
