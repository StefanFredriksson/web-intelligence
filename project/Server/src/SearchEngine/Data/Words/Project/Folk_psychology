Folk psychology In philosophy of mind and cognitive science folk psychology or commonsense psychology is a human capacity to explain and predict the behavior and mental state of other people 1 Processes and items encountered in daily life such as pain pleasure excitement and anxiety use common linguistic terms as opposed to technical or scientific jargon 2 Traditionally the study of folk psychology has focused on how everyday peoplethose without formal training in the various academic fields of sciencego about attributing mental states This domain has primarily been centred on intentional states reflective of an individuals beliefs and desires each described in terms of everyday language and concepts such as beliefs desires fear and hope 3 Eliminative materialism is the claim that folk psychology is false and should be discarded or eliminated Contents 1 Key folkconcepts 11 Intentionality 12 Comprehension and prediction 121 The Context Model 13 Explanation 131 Hiltons

edit Intentionality edit When perceiving explaining or criticizing human behaviour people distinguish between intentional and unintentional actions 4 An evaluation of an action as stemming from purposeful action or accidental circumstances is one of the key determinants in social interaction Others are the environmental conditions or precognitive matters For example a critical remark that is judged to be intentional on the part of the receiver of the message can be viewed as a hurtful insult Conversely if considered unintentional the same remark may be dismissed and forgiven The folk concept of intentionality is applied in the legal system to distinguish between murder and manslaughter It is also used to distinguish between intentional and unintentional behaviour in several sports where intentional fouls are punished more harshly than ones deemed to be unintentional The importance of this concept transcends almost all aspects of everyday life with empirical studies in social and developmental psychology exploring perceived intentionalitys role as a mediator for aggression relationship conflict judgments of responsibility blame or punishment 5 6 Recent empirical literature on folk psychology has shown that peoples theories regarding intentional actions involve four distinct factors beliefs desires causal histories and enabling factors 7 Here beliefs and desires represent the central variables responsible for the folk theories of intention Desires embody outcomes that an individual seeks including those that are impossible to achieve 8 The key difference between desires and intentions is that desires can be purely hypothetical whereas intentions specify an outcome that the individual is actually trying to bring to fruition 8 In terms of beliefs there are several types that are relevant to intentionsoutcome beliefs and ability beliefs Outcome beliefs are beliefs as to whether a given action will fulfill an intention as in purchasing a new watch will impress my friends 4 Ability consists of an actors conviction regarding his or her ability to perform an action as in I really can afford the new watch In light of this Heider postulated that ability beliefs could be attributed with causing individuals to form goals that would not otherwise have been entertained 9 Comprehension and prediction edit The Context Model edit Folk psychology is crucial to evaluating and ultimately understanding novel concepts and items Developed by Medin Altom and Murphy the Context Model 10 hypothesizes that as a result of mental models in the form of prototype and exemplar representations individuals are able to more accurately represent and comprehend the environment around them According to the model the overall similarity between the prototype and a given instance of a category is evaluated based on multiple dimensions eg shape size color A multiplicative function modeled after this phenomenon was created s P E i k s P E i k displaystyle sPEiprod ksPEik Here SPEi represents the similarity between the prototype and the i th exemplar k is the subscript for the dimensions k 1k and SPEik is the similarity between the prototype and the i th exemplar on the k th dimension Explanation edit Hiltons 1990 Conversational Model edit Given that folk psychology represents causal knowledge associated with the minds categorization processes citation needed it follows that folk psychology is actively employed in aiding the explanation of everyday actions Denis Hilton s 1990 Conversational Model was created with this causal explanation in mind with the model having the ability to generate specific predictions Hilton coined his model the conversational model because he argued that as a social activity unlike prediction explanation requires an audience to whom the individual explains the event or action 11 According to the model causal explanations follow two particular conversational maxims from Grices 1975 models of conversationthe manner maxim and the quantity maxim Grice indicated that the content of a conversation should be relevant informative and fitting of the audiences gap in knowledge 12 Cognizant of this the Conversational Model indicates that the explainer upon evaluation of his audience will modify his explanation to cater their needs In essence demonstrating the inherent need for mental comparison and in subsequent modification of behaviour in everyday explanations Application and functioning edit Beliefdesire model edit The beliefdesire model of psychology illustrates one method in which folk psychology is utilized in everyday life According to this model people perform an action if they want an outcome and believe that it can be obtained by performing the action However beliefs and desires are not responsible for immediate action intention acts as a mediator of beliefdesire and action 8 In other words consider a person who wants to achieve a goal G and believes action A will aid in attaining G this leads to an intention to perform A which is then carried out to produce action A A schematic representation of folk psychology of belief desire intention and action Schank Abelson 1977 described this inclusion of typical beliefs desires and intentions underlying an action as akin to a script whereby an individual is merely following an unconscious framework that leads to the ultimate decision of whether an action will be performed 13 Similarly Barsalou 1985 described the category of the mind as an ideal whereby if a desire a belief and an intention were all present they would rationally lead to a given action They coined this phenomenon the ideal of rational action 14 Goalintentional action model edit Existing literature has widely corroborated the fact that social behavior is greatly affected by the causes to which people attribute actions 9 In particular it has been shown that an individuals interpretation of the causes of behaviour reflects their preexisting beliefs regarding the actors mental state and motivation behind his or her actions 15 It follows that they draw on the assumed intentions of actors to guide their own responses to punish or reward the actor This concept is extended to cover instances in which behavioural evidence is lacking Under these circumstances it has been shown that the individual will again draw on assumed intentions in order to predict the actions of the third party 9 Although the two components are often used interchangeably in common parlance there is an important distinction between the goals and intentions This discrepancy lies in the fact that individuals with an intention to perform an action also foster the belief that it will be achieved whereas the same person with a goal may not necessarily believe that the action is able to be performed in spite of having a strong desire to do so Predicting goals and actions much like the BeliefDesire Model involves moderating variables that determine whether an action will be performed In the GoalIntentional Action Model the predictors of goals and actions are the actors beliefs about his or her abilities and their actual possession of preconditions required to carry out the action 16 Additionally preconditions consist of the various conditions necessary in order for realization of intentions This includes abilities and skills in addition to environmental variables that may come into play Schank Abelson raises the example of going to a restaurant where the preconditions include the ability to afford the bill and get to the correct venue in addition to the fact that the restaurant must be open for business 13 Traditionally people prefer to allude to preconditions to explain actions that have a high probability of being unattainable whereas goals tend to be described as a wide range of common actions Model of everyday inferences edit Models of everyday inferences capture folk psychology of human informal reasoning Many models of this nature have been developed They express and refine our folk psychological ways of understanding of how one makes inferences For example one model 17 describes human everyday reasoning as combinations of simple direct rules and similaritybased processes From the interaction of these simple mechanisms seemingly complex patterns of reasoning emerge The model has been used to account for a variety of reasoning data Controversy edit Further information Eliminative materialism Folk psychology remains the subject of much contention in academic circles with respect to its scope method and the significance of its contributions to the scientific community 18 failed verification A large part of this criticism stems from the prevailing impression that folk psychology is a primitive practice reserved for the uneducated and nonacademics in discussing their everyday lives 19 There is significant debate over whether folk psychology is useful for academic purposes specifically whether it can be relevant with regard to the scientific psychology domain It has been argued that a mechanism used for laypeoples understanding predicting and explaining each others actions is inapplicable with regards to the requirements of the scientific method 19 Conversely opponents have called for patience seeing the mechanism employed by laypeople for understanding each others actions as important in their formation of bases for future action when encountering similar situations Malle Knobe hailed this systematization of peoples everyday understanding of the mind as an inevitable progression towards a more comprehensive field of psychology 4 Medin et al provide another advantage of conceptualizing folk psychology with their Mixture Model of Categorization 20 it is advantageous as it helps predict action See also edit Common sense Intentional stance Theory of mind References edit Folk Psychology as a Theory Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Platostanfordedu Retrieved
