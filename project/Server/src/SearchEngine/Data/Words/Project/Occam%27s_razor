Occams razor Philosophical principle of selecting the solution with the fewest assumptions For the aerial theatre company see Ockhams Razor Theatre Company Manuscript illustration of William of Ockham Occams razor also Ockhams razor or Ochams razor Latin novacula Occami or law of parsimony Latin lex parsimoniae is the problemsolving principle that states that Entities should not be multiplied without necessity 1 2 The idea is attributed to English Franciscan friar William of Ockham c 12871347 a scholastic philosopher and theologian who used a preference for simplicity to defend the idea of divine miracles It is sometimes paraphrased by a statement like the simplest solution is most likely the right one but is the same as the Razor only if results match Occams razor says that when presented with competing hypotheses that make the same predictions one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions 3 and it is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions Similarly in science Occams razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models 4 5 In the scientific method Occams razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the falsifiability criterion For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon there may be an extremely large perhaps even incomprehensible number of possible and more complex alternatives Since one can always burden failing explanations with ad hoc hypotheses to prevent them from being falsified simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more testable 6 7 8 Contents 1 History 11

The phrase Occams razor did not appear until a few centuries after William of Ockham s death in 1347 Libert Froidmont in his On Christian Philosophy of the Soul takes credit for the phrase speaking of novacula occami 9 Ockham did not invent this principle but the razorand its association with himmay be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it 10 Ockham stated the principle in various ways but the most popular version Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate was formulated by the Irish Franciscan philosopher John Punch in his 1639 commentary on the works of Duns Scotus 11 Formulations before William of Ockham edit Part of a page from John Duns Scotus s book Commentaria oxoniensia ad IV libros magistri Sententiarus showing the words Pluralitas nonest ponenda sine necessitate ie Plurality is not to be posited without necessity The origins of what has come to be known as Occams razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as John Duns Scotus 12651308 Robert Grosseteste 11751253 Maimonides Moses benMaimon 11381204 and even Aristotle 384322BC 12 13 Aristotle writes in his Posterior Analytics We may assume the superiority ceteris paribus other things being equal of the demonstration which derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses Ptolemy c AD 90 c AD 168 stated We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible 14 Phrases such as It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer and A plurality is not to be posited without necessity were commonplace in 13thcentury scholastic writing 14 Robert Grosseteste in Commentary on Aristotles the Posterior Analytics Books Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros c 12171220 declares That is better and more valuable which requires fewer other circumstances being equal For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises Similarly in natural science in moral science and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer other circumstances being equal 15 The Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas 12251274 states that it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to Gods existence an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally cf quinque viae and specifically through an argument based on causality 16 Hence Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occams razor but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations cf also Correlation does not imply causation William of Ockham edit William of Ockham circa 12871347 was an English Franciscan friar and theologian an influential medieval philosopher and a nominalist His popular fame as a great logician rests chiefly on the maxim attributed to him and known as Occams razor The term razor refers to distinguishing between two hypotheses either by shaving away unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions While it has been claimed that Occams razor is not found in any of Williams writings 17 one can cite statements such as Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate William of Ockham Wikiquote Plurality must never be posited without necessity which occurs in his theological work on the Sentences of Peter Lombard Quaestiones et decisiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi ed Lugd 1495 i dist 27 qu 2 K Nevertheless the precise words sometimes attributed to William of Ockham Entia nonsunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity 18 are absent in his extant works 19 this particular phrasing comes from John Punch 20 who described the principle as a common axiom axioma vulgare of the Scholastics 11 William of Ockhams contribution seems to restrict the operation of this principle in matters pertaining to miracles and Gods power so in the Eucharist a plurality of miracles is possible simply because it pleases God 14 This principle is sometimes phrased as Pluralitas nonest ponenda sine necessitate Plurality should not be posited without necessity 21 In his Summa Totius Logicae i 12 William of Ockham cites the principle of economy Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora It is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer Thorburn 1918 pp35253 Kneale and Kneale 1962 p243 Later formulations edit To quote Isaac Newton We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances Therefore to the same natural effects we must as far as possible assign the same causes 22 23 Bertrand Russell offers a particular version of Occams razor Whenever possible substitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities 24 Around 1960 Ray Solomonoff founded the theory of universal inductive inference the theory of prediction based on observations for example predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols The only assumption is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution This theory is a mathematical formalization of Occams razor 25 26 27 Another technical approach to Occams razor is ontological parsimony 28 Parsimony means spareness and is also referred to as the Rule of Simplicity This is considered a strong version of Occams razor 29 30 A variation used in medicine is called the Zebra a doctor should reject an exotic medical diagnosis when a more commonplace explanation is more likely derived from Theodore Woodward s dictum When you hear hoofbeats think of horses not zebras 31 Ernst Mach formulated the stronger version of Occams razor into physics which he called the Principle of Economy stating Scientists must use the simplest means of arriving at their results and exclude everything not perceived by the senses 32 This principle goes back at least as far as Aristotle who wrote Nature operates in the shortest way possible 29 The idea of parsimony or simplicity in deciding between theories though not the intent of the original expression of Occams razor has been assimilated into our culture as the widespread laymans formulation that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one 29 Justifications edit Aesthetic edit Prior to the 20th century it was a commonly held belief that nature itself was simple and that simpler hypotheses about nature were thus more likely to be true This notion was deeply rooted in the aesthetic value that simplicity holds for human thought and the justifications presented for it often drew from theology Thomas Aquinas made this argument in the 13th century writing If a thing can be done adequately by means of one it is superfluous to do it by means of several for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments if one suffices 33 Beginning in the 20th century epistemological justifications based on induction logic pragmatism and especially probability theory have become more popular among philosophers who Empirical edit Occams razor has gained strong empirical support in helping to converge on better theories see Applications section below for some examples In the related concept of overfitting excessively complex models are affected by statistical noise a problem also known as the biasvariance tradeoff whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better predictive performance It is however often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise cf model selection test set minimum description length Bayesian inference etc Testing the razor edit The razors statement that other things being equal simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones is amenable to empirical testing Another interpretation of the razors statement would be that simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations If one accepts the first interpretation the validity of Occams razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones while the converse would lend support to its use If the latter interpretation is accepted the validity of Occams razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not Possible explanations can become needlessly complex It might be coherent for instance to add the involvement of leprechauns to any explanation but Occams razor would prevent such additions unless they were necessary Some increases in complexity are sometimes necessary so there remains a justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations To understand why consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon there is always an infinite number of possible more complex and ultimately incorrect alternatives This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an ad hoc hypothesis Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified Even other empirical criteria such as consilience can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition Each true explanation then may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable On a commonly accepted repeatability principle these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation clarification needed In addition one does not say an explanation is true if it has not withstood this principle Put another way any new and even more complex theory can still possibly be true For example if an individual makes supernatural claims that leprechauns were responsible for breaking a vase the simpler explanation would be that he is mistaken but ongoing ad hoc justifications eg and thats not me on the film they tampered with that too successfully prevent outright disproval This endless supply of elaborate competing explanations called saving hypotheses cannot be ruled out except by using Occams razor 34 35 36 A study of the predictive validity of Occams razor found 32 published papers that included 97 comparisons of economic forecasts from simple and complex forecasting methods None of the papers provided a balance of evidence that complexity of method improved forecast accuracy In the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons complexity increased forecast errors by an average of 27 percent 37 Practical considerations and pragmatism edit See also Pragmatism and Problem of Induction Mathematical edit Main article Akaike information criterion One justification of Occams razor is a direct result of basic probability theory By definition all assumptions introduce possibilities for error if an assumption does not improve the accuracy of a theory its only effect is to increase the probability that the overall theory is wrong There have also been other attempts to derive Occams razor from probability theory including notable attempts made by Harold Jeffreys and E T Jaynes The probabilistic Bayesian basis for Occams razor is elaborated by David J C MacKay in chapter 28 of his book Information Theory Inference and Learning Algorithms 38 where he emphasizes that a prior bias in favour of simpler models is not required William H Jefferys and James O Berger 1991 generalize and quantify the original formulations assumptions concept as the degree to which a proposition is unnecessarily accommodating to possible observable data 39 They state A hypothesis with fewer adjustable parameters will automatically have an enhanced posterior probability due to the fact that the predictions it makes are sharp 39 The model they propose balances the precision of a theorys predictions against their sharpness vague preferring theories that sharply vague make correct predictions over theories that accommodate a wide range of other possible results This again reflects the mathematical relationship between key concepts in Bayesian inference namely marginal probability conditional probability and posterior probability The biasvariance tradeoff is a framework that incorporates the Occams razor principal in its balance between overfitting ie variance minimization and underfitting ie bias minimization 40 Other philosophers edit Karl Popper edit Karl Popper argues that a preference for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its falsifiability criterion we prefer simpler theories to more complex ones because their empirical content is greater and because they are better testable Popper 1992 The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one and is thus more easily falsifiable This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well Elliott Sober edit The philosopher of science Elliott Sober once argued along the same lines as Popper tying simplicity with informativeness The simplest theory is the more informative in the sense that it requires less information to a question 41 He has since rejected this account of simplicity purportedly because it fails to provide an epistemic justification for simplicity He now believes that simplicity considerations and considerations of parsimony in particular do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental Philosophers he suggests may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity ie endowed it with a sui generis existence when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context Sober 1992 If we fail to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them we may have no noncircular justification Just as the question why be rational may have no noncircular answer the same may be true of the question why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses 42 Richard Swinburne edit Richard Swinburne argues for simplicity on logical grounds mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 the simplest hypothesis proposed as an explanation of phenomena is more likely to be the true one than is any other available hypothesis that its predictions are more likely to be true than those of any other available hypothesis and that it is an ultimate a priori epistemic principle that simplicity is evidence for truth Swinburne 1997 According to Swinburne since our choice of theory cannot be determined by data see Underdetermination and DuhemQuine thesis we must rely on some criterion to determine which theory to use Since it is absurd to have no logical method for settling on one hypothesis amongst an infinite number of equally datacompliant hypotheses we should choose the simplest theory Either science is irrational in the way it judges theories and predictions probable or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth Swinburne 1997 Michael Franiek edit Franiek argues for simplicity on the grounds of human nature Humans prefer the easiest choice when given multiple which is more often than not the most simple Ludwig Wittgenstein edit From the Tractatus LogicoPhilosophicus 3328 If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless That is the meaning of Occams Razor If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning then it has meaning 404 In the proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs which it represents They must both possess the same logical mathematical multiplicity cf Hertzs Mechanics on Dynamic Models 547321 Occams Razor is of course not an arbitrary rule nor one justified by its practical success It simply says that unnecessary elements in a symbolism mean nothing Signs which serve one purpose are logically equivalent signs which serve no purpose are logically meaningless and on the related concept of simplicity 6363 The procedure of induction consists in accepting as true the simplest law that can be reconciled with our experiences Applications edit Science and the scientific method edit Andreas Cellarius s illustration of the Copernican system from the Harmonia Macrocosmica 1660 Future positions of the sun moon and other solar system bodies can be calculated using a geocentric model the earth is at the centre or using a heliocentric model the sun is at the centre Both work but the geocentric model arrives at the same conclusions through a much more complex system of calculations than the heliocentric model This was pointed out in a preface to Copernicus first edition of De revolutionibus orbium coelestium In science Occams razor is used as a heuristic to guide scientists in developing theoretical models rather than as an arbiter between published models 4 5 In physics parsimony was an important heuristic in Albert Einstein s formulation of special relativity 43 44 in the development and application of the principle of least action by Pierre Louis Maupertuis and Leonhard Euler 45 and in the development of quantum mechanics by Max Planck Werner Heisenberg and Louis de Broglie 5 46 In chemistry Occams razor is often an important heuristic when developing a model of a reaction mechanism 47 48 Although it is useful as a heuristic in developing models of reaction mechanisms it has been shown to fail as a criterion for selecting among some selected published models 5 In this context Einstein himself expressed caution when he formulated Einsteins Constraint It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience An oftenquoted version of this constraint which cannot be verified as posited by Einstein himself 49 says Everything should be kept as simple as possible but not simpler In the scientific method parsimony is an epistemological metaphysical or heuristic preference not an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result 6 7 8 As a logical principle Occams razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data However science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data Science prefers the simplest explanation that is consistent with the data available at a given time but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available 4 7 That is science is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles 6 7 8 When scientists use the idea of parsimony it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem The reasonableness of parsimony in one research context may have nothing to do with its reasonableness in another It is a mistake to think that there is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter 8 It has been suggested that Occams razor is a widely accepted example of extraevidential consideration even though it is entirely a metaphysical assumption There is little empirical evidence that the world is actually simple or that simple accounts are more likely to be true than complex ones 50 Most of the time Occams razor is a conservative tool cutting out crazy complicated constructions and assuring that hypotheses are grounded in the science of the day thus yielding normal science models of explanation and prediction 5 There are however notable exceptions where Occams razor turns a conservative scientist into a reluctant revolutionary For example Max Planck interpolated between the Wien and Jeans radiation laws and used Occams razor logic to formulate the quantum hypothesis even resisting that hypothesis as it became more obvious that it was correct 5 Appeals to simplicity were used to argue against the phenomena of meteorites ball lightning continental drift and reverse transcriptase 51 One can argue for atomic building blocks for matter because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed reversibility of both mixing and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks At the time however the atomic theory was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles that had not been directly detected Ernst Mach and the logical positivists rejected John Dalton s atomic theory until the reality of atoms was more evident in Brownian motion as shown by Albert Einstein 52 In the same way postulating the aether is more complex than transmission of light through a vacuum At the time however all known waves propagated through a physical medium and it seemed simpler to postulate the existence of a medium than to theorize about wave propagation without a medium Likewise Newtons idea of light particles seemed simpler than Christiaan Huygenss idea of waves so many favored it In this case as it turned out neither the wavenor the particleexplanation alone suffices as light behaves like waves and like particles Three axioms presupposed by the scientific method are realism the existence of objective reality the existence of natural laws and the constancy of natural law Rather than depend on provability of these axioms science depends on the fact that they have not been objectively falsified Occams razor and parsimony support but do not prove these axioms of science The general principle of science is that theories or models of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations This ultimate arbiter selection criterion rests upon the axioms mentioned above 7 There are examples where Occams razor would have favored the wrong theory given the available data Simplicity principles are useful philosophical preferences for choosing a more likely theory from among several possibilities that are all consistent with available data A single instance of Occams razor favoring a wrong theory falsifies the razor as a general principle 7 Michael Lee and others 53 provide cases in which a parsimonious approach does not guarantee a correct conclusion and if based on incorrect working hypotheses or interpretations of incomplete data may even strongly support a false conclusion If multiple models of natural law make exactly the same testable predictions they are equivalent and there is no need for parsimony to choose a preferred one For example Newtonian Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent Physicists have no interest in using Occams razor to say the other two are wrong Likewise there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions 7 Biology edit Biologists or philosophers of biology use Occams razor in either of two contexts both in evolutionary biology the units of selection controversy and systematics George C Williams in his book Adaptation and Natural Selection 1966 argues that the best way to explain altruism among animals is based on lowlevel ie individual selection as opposed to highlevel group selection Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists eg R Alexander 1987 W D Hamilton 1964 as behavior that is beneficial to others or to the group at a cost to the individual and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms of the behaviors of individual organisms acting in their own selfinterest or in the interest of their genes via kin selection Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits eg D S Wilson E O Wilson 2007 The basis for Williams contention is that of the two individual selection is the more parsimonious theory In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occams razor known as Morgans Canon In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development Morgan 1903 However more recent biological analyses such as Richard Dawkins The Selfish Gene have contended that Morgans Canon is not the simplest and most basic explanation Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species ie natural selection turns out to select specific genes and this is really the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as emergent features of evolution Zoology provides an example Muskoxen when threatened by wolves form a circle with the males on the outside and the females and young on the inside This is an example of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory Another interpretation is kin selection if the males are protecting their offspring they are protecting copies of their own alleles Engaging in this behavior would be favored by individual selection if the cost to the male musk ox is less than half of the benefit received by his calf which could easily be the case if wolves have an easier time killing calves than adult males It could also be the case that male musk oxen would be individually less likely to be killed by wolves if they stood in a circle with their horns pointing out regardless of whether they were protecting the females and offspring That would be an example of regular natural selection a phenomenon called the selfish herd Systematics is the branch of biology that attempts to establish patterns of genealogical relationship among biological taxa It is also concerned with their classification There are three primary camps in systematics cladists pheneticists and evolutionary taxonomists The cladists hold that genealogy alone should determine classification pheneticists contend that overall similarity is the determining criterion while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification 54 It is among the cladists that Occams razor is to be found although their term for it is cladistic parsimony Cladistic parsimony or maximum parsimony is a method of phylogenetic inference in the construction of types of phylogenetic trees more specifically cladograms Cladograms are branching treelike structures used to represent hypotheses of relative degree of relationship based on shared derived character states Cladistic parsimony is used to select as the preferred hypothesis of relationships the cladogram that requires the fewest implied character state transformations Critics of the cladistic approach often observe that for some types of tree parsimony consistently produces the wrong results regardless of how much data is collected this is called statistical inconsistency or long branch attraction However this criticism is also potentially true for any type of phylogenetic inference unless the model used to estimate the tree reflects the way that evolution actually happened Because this information is not empirically accessible the criticism of statistical inconsistency against parsimony holds no force 55 For a booklength treatment of cladistic parsimony see Elliott Sober s Reconstructing the Past Parsimony Evolution and Inference 1988 For a discussion of both uses of Occams razor in biology see Sobers article Lets Razor Ockhams Razor 1990 Other methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more traditional way Likelihood methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters ie numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters Thus complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses Recent advances employ information theory a close cousin of likelihood which uses Occams razor in the same way Francis Crick has commented on potential limitations of Occams razor in biology He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of an ongoing natural selection the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense He cautions While Ockhams razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences it can be a very dangerous implement in biology It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research 56 In biogeography parsimony is used to infer ancient migrations of species or populations by observing the geographic distribution and relationships of existing organisms Given the phylogenetic tree ancestral migrations are inferred to be those that require the minimum amount of total movement Religion edit Main article Existence of God In the philosophy of religion Occams razor is sometimes applied to the existence of God William of Ockham himself was a Christian He believed in God and in the authority of Scripture he writes that nothing ought to be posited without a reason given unless it is selfevident literally known through itself or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture 57 Ockham believed that an explanation has no sufficient basis in reality when it does not harmonize with reason experience or the Bible However unlike many theologians of his time Ockham did not believe God could be logically proven with arguments To Ockham science was a matter of discovery but theology was a matter of revelation and faith He states only faith gives us access to theological truths The ways of God are not open to reason for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover 58 St Thomas Aquinas in the Summa Theologica uses a formulation of Occams razor to construct an objection to the idea that God exists which he refutes directly with a counterargument 59 Further it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles supposing God did not exist For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason or will Therefore there is no need to suppose Gods existence In turn Aquinas answers this with the quinque viae and addresses the particular objection above with the following answer Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God as to its first cause So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will since these can change or fail for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and selfnecessary first principle as was shown in the body of the Article Rather than argue for the necessity of a god some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of or prior to reason making Occams razor irrelevant This was the stance of Søren Kierkegaard who viewed belief in God as a leap of faith that sometimes directly opposed reason 60 This is also the doctrine of Gordon Clark s presuppositional apologetics with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason see also Fideism Various arguments in favor of God establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption Contrastingly some antitheists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity Schmitt 2005 eg the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit Another application of the principle is to be found in the work of George Berkeley 16851753 Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone He invoked Occams razor against materialism stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable One potential problem with this belief is that its possible given Berkeleys position to find solipsism itself more in line with the razor than a Godmediated world beyond a single thinker Occams razor may also be recognized in the apocryphal story about an exchange between PierreSimon Laplace and Napoleon It is said that in praising Laplace for one of his recent publications the emperor asked how it was that the name of God which featured so frequently in the writings of Lagrange appeared nowhere in Laplaces At that he is said to have replied Its because I had no need of that hypothesis 61 Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplaces atheism more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of methodological naturalism or even simply that the fewer logical premises one assumes the stronger is ones conclusion In his article Sensations and Brain Processes 1959 J J C Smart invoked Occams razor with the aim to justify his preference of the mindbrain identity theory over spiritbody dualism Dualists state that there are two kinds of substances in the universe physical including the body and spiritual which is nonphysical In contrast identity theorists state that everything is physical including consciousness and that there is nothing nonphysical Though it is impossible to appreciate the spiritual when limiting oneself to the physical Smart maintained that identity theory explains all phenomena by assuming only a physical reality Subsequently Smart has been severely criticized for his use or misuse of Occams razor and ultimately retracted his advocacy of it in this context Paul Churchland 1984 states that by itself Occams razor is inconclusive regarding duality In a similar way Dale Jacquette 1994 stated that Occams razor has been used in attempts to justify eliminativism and reductionism in the philosophy of mind Eliminativism is the thesis that the ontology of folk psychology including such entities as pain joy desire fear etc are eliminable in favor of an ontology of a completed neuroscience Penal ethics edit In penal theory and the philosophy of punishment parsimony refers specifically to taking care in the distribution of punishment in order to avoid excessive punishment In the utilitarian approach to the philosophy of punishment Jeremy Bentham s parsimony principle states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of proportionality Parsimony is a key consideration of the modern restorative justice and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment as well as the prison abolition movement Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the sensibility of the individualan individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminals relative sensitivity to specific punishments 62 Probability theory and statistics edit Marcus Hutters universal artificial intelligence builds upon Solomonoffs mathematical formalization of the razor to calculate the expected value of an action There are various papers in scholarly journals deriving formal versions of Occams razor from probability theory applying it in statistical inference and using it to come up with criteria for penalizing complexity in statistical inference Papers 63 64 have suggested a connection between Occams razor and Kolmogorov complexity 65 One of the problems with the original formulation of the razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power ie it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison which is based on Bayes factors and can be used to compare models that dont fit the observations equally well These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model Generally the exact Occam factor is intractable but approximations such as Akaike information criterion Bayesian information criterion Variational Bayesian methods false discovery rate and Laplaces method are used Many artificial intelligence researchers are now employing such techniques for instance through work on Occam Learning or more generally on the Free energy principle Statistical versions of Occams razor have a more rigorous formulation than what philosophical discussions produce In particular they must have a specific definition of the term simplicity and that definition can vary For example in the Kolmogorov Chaitin minimum description length approach the subject must pick a Turing machine whose operations describe the basic operations believed to represent simplicity by the subject However one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct ones entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor This has led to two opposing camps one that believes Occams razor is objective and one that believes it is subjective Objective razor edit The minimum instruction set of a universal Turing machine requires approximately the same length description across different formulations and is small compared to the Kolmogorov complexity of most practical theories Marcus Hutter has used this consistency to define a natural Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex instruction sets in the formulation of razors 66 Describing the program for the universal program as the hypothesis and the representation of the evidence as program data it has been formally proven under ZermeloFraenkel set theory that the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized 67 Interpreting this as minimising the total length of a twopart message encoding model followed by data given model gives us the minimum message length MML principle 63 64 One possible conclusion from mixing the concepts of Kolmogorov complexity and Occams razor is that an ideal data compressor would also be a scientific explanationformulation generator Some attempts have been made to rederive known laws from considerations of simplicity or compressibility 26 68 According to Jürgen Schmidhuber the appropriate mathematical theory of Occams razor already exists namely Solomonoffs theory of optimal inductive inference 69 and its extensions 70 See discussions in David L Dowes Foreword re C S Wallace 71 for the subtle distinctions between the algorithmic probability work of Solomonoff and the MML work of Chris Wallace and see Dowes MML hybrid Bayesian network graphical models statistical consistency invariance and uniqueness 72 both for such discussions and for in section 4 discussions of MML and Occams razor For a specific example of MML as Occams razor in the problem of decision tree induction see Dowe and Needhams Message Length as an Effective Ockhams Razor in Decision Tree Induction 73 Controversial aspects edit Occams razor is not an embargo against the positing of any kind of entity or a recommendation of the simplest theory come what may a Occams razor is used to adjudicate between theories that have already passed theoretical scrutiny tests and are equally wellsupported by evidence b Furthermore it may be used to prioritize empirical testing between two equally plausible but unequally testable hypotheses thereby minimizing costs and wastes while increasing chances of falsification of the simplertotest hypothesis Another contentious aspect of the razor is that a theory can become more complex in terms of its structure or syntax while its ontology or semantics becomes simpler or vice versa c Quine in a discussion on definition referred to these two perspectives as economy of practical expression and economy in grammar and vocabulary respectively 75 Galileo Galilei lampooned the misuse of Occams razor in his Dialogue The principle is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them Antirazors edit Occams razor has met some opposition from people who have considered it too extreme or rash Walter Chatton c 12901343 was a contemporary of William of Ockham c 12871347 who took exception to Occams razor and Ockhams use of it In response he devised his own antirazor If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things a fourth must be added and so on Although there have been a number of philosophers who have formulated similar antirazors since Chattons time no one antirazor has perpetuated in as much notability as Chattons antirazor although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution Se non è vero è ben trovato Even if it is not true it is well conceived when referred to a particularly artful explanation Antirazors have also been created by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz 16461716 Immanuel Kant 17241804 and Karl Menger 19021985 Leibnizs version took the form of a principle of plenitude as Arthur Lovejoy has called it the idea being that God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds Kant felt a need to moderate the effects of Occams razor and thus created his own counterrazor The variety of beings should not rashly be diminished 76 Karl Menger found mathematicians to be too parsimonious with regard to variables so he formulated his Law Against Miserliness which took one of two forms Entities must not be reduced to the point of inadequacy and It is vain to do with fewer what requires more A less serious but some who might say even more extremist antirazor is Pataphysics the science of imaginary solutions developed by Alfred Jarry 18731907 Perhaps the ultimate in antireductionism Pataphysics seeks no less than to view each event in the universe as completely unique subject to no laws but its own Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges in his storymockessay Tlön Uqbar Orbis Tertius There is also Crabtrees Bludgeon which cynically states that no set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation

view explaining systems in terms of smaller parts Regress argument Scientific method Interplay between observation experiment and theory in science Scientific skepticism Simplicity Sparse matrix Spherical cow A humorous metaphor for highly simplified scientific models of complex real life phenomena Notes edit Ockhams razor does not say that the more simple a hypothesis the better 74 Today we think of the principle of parsimony as a heuristic device We dont assume that the simpler theory is correct and the more complex one false We know from experience that more often than not the theory that requires more complicated machinations is wrong Until proved otherwise the more complex theory competing with a simpler explanation should be put on the back burner but not thrown onto the trash heap of history until proven false 74 While these two facets of simplicity are frequently conflated it is important to treat them as distinct One reason for doing so is that considerations of parsimony and of elegance typically pull in different directions Postulating extra entities may allow a theory to be formulated more simply while reducing the ontology of a theory may only be possible at the price of making it syntactically more complex 6 References edit Who sharpened Occams Razor Jonathan Schaffer 2015 What Not to Multiply Without Necessity Australasian Journal of Philosophy 934
