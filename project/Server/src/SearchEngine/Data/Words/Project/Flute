Yueqin China Zhongruan China Zhu China Zither Percussion Keyboards v t e The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening According to the instrument classification of HornbostelSachs flutes are categorized as edgeblown aerophones 1 failed verification A musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player flautist flutist or less commonly fluter or flutenist Flutes are the earliest extant musical instruments as paleolithic instruments with handbored holes have been found A number of flutes dating to about 43000 to 35000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Jura region of presentday Germany These flutes demonstrate that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe 2 3 Contents 1 Etymology and terminology 2 History 3 Acoustics 4

Sodina and suling 46 Sring 5 See also 6 References 7 Bibliography 8 External links Etymology and terminology Chinese flute store The word flute first entered the English language during the Middle English period as floute 4 or else flowte floyte 5 possibly from Old French flaute and from Old Provençal flaüt 4 or else from Old French fleüte flaüte flahute via Middle High German floite or Dutch fluit The English verb flout has the same linguistic root and the modern Dutch verb fluiten still shares the two meanings 6 Attempts to trace the word back to the Latin flare to blow inflate have been pronounced phonologically impossible or inadmissable 5 The first known use of the word flute was in the 14th century 7 According to the Oxford English Dictionary this was in Geoffrey Chaucer s The Hous of Fame c1380 5 Today a musician who plays any instrument in the flute family can be called a flutist pronounced FLEWtist most common in the US 8 or flautist pronounced FLAWtist most common in the UK 9 or simply a flute player more neutrally Flutist dates back to at least 1603 the earliest quotation cited by the Oxford English Dictionary Flautist was used in 1860 by Nathaniel Hawthorne in The Marble Faun after being adopted during the 18th century from Italy flautista itself from flauto like many musical terms in England since the Italian Renaissance Other English terms now virtually obsolete are fluter 15th19th centuries 10 11 12 and flutenist 17th18th centuries 6 13 History Further information Paleolithic flutes and Prehistoric music Chinese women playing flutes from the 12thcentury Song dynasty remake of the Night Revels of Han Xizai originally by Gu Hongzhong 10th century The oldest flute ever discovered may be a fragment of the femur of a juvenile cave bear with two to four holes found at Divje Babe in Slovenia and dated to about 43000 years ago However this has been disputed 14 15 In 2008 another flute dated back to at least 35000 years ago was discovered in Hohle Fels cave near Ulm Germany 16 The fiveholed flute has a Vshaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone The researchers involved in the discovery officially published their findings in the journal Nature in August 2009 17 The discovery was also the oldest confirmed find of any musical instrument in history 18 until a redating of flutes found in Geißenklösterle cave revealed them to be even older with an age of 42000 to 43000 years 3 The flute one of several found was found in the Hohle Fels cavern next to the Venus of Hohle Fels and a short distance from the oldest known human carving 19 failed verification On announcing the discovery scientists suggested that the finds demonstrate the presence of a wellestablished musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized Europe 20 Scientists have also suggested that the discovery of the flute may help to explain the probable behavioural and cognitive gulf between Neanderthals and early modern human 18 A threeholed flute 187cm long made from a mammoth tusk from the Geißenklösterle cave near Ulm in the southern German Swabian Alb and dated to 30000 to 37000 years ago 21 was discovered in 2004 and two flutes made from swan bones excavated a decade earlier from the same cave in Germany dated to circa 36000 years ago are among the oldest known musical instruments Panflute players Cantigas de Santa Maria mid13th century Spain Statue of Krishna playing a flute A playable 9000yearold Gudi literally bone flute was excavated from a tomb in Jiahu along with 29 defunct twins 22 made from the wing bones of redcrowned cranes with five to eight holes each in the Central Chinese province of Henan 23 The earliest extant Chinese transverse flute is a chi 篪 flute discovered in the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng at the Suizhou site Hubei province China It dates from 433 BC of the later Zhou Dynasty 24 It is fashioned of lacquered bamboo with closed ends and has five stops that are at the flutes side instead of the top Chi flutes are mentioned in Shi Jing compiled and edited by Confucius according to tradition The earliest written reference to a flute is from a Sumerian language cuneiform tablet dated to c 26002700 BCE 25 Flutes are also mentioned in a recently translated tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh an epic poem whose development spanned the period of approximately 2100600 BCE 26 Additionally a set of cuneiform tablets knows as the musical texts provide precise tuning instructions for seven scale of a stringed instrument assumed to be a Babylonian lyre One of those scales is named embūbum which is an Akkadian word for flute 26 The Bible in Genesis 421 cites Jubal as being the father of all those who play the ugab and the kinnor The former Hebrew term is believed by some to refer to some wind instrument or wind instruments in general the latter to a stringed instrument or stringed instruments in general As such Jubal is regarded in the JudeoChristian tradition as the inventor of the flute a word used in some translations of this biblical passage 27 Elsewhere in the Bible the flute is referred to as chalil from the root word for hollow in particular in 1 Samuel 105 1 Kings 140 Isaiah 512 and 3029 and Jeremiah 4836 28 Archeological digs in the Holy Land have discovered flutes from both the Bronze Age c 40001200 BCE and the Iron Age 1200586 BCE the latter era witnessing the creation of the Israelite kingdom and its separation into the two kingdoms of Israel and Judea 27 Some early flutes were made out of tibias shin bones The flute has also always been an essential part of Indian culture and mythology 29 and the cross flute believed by several accounts to originate in India 30 31 as Indian literature from 1500 BCE has made vague references to the cross flute 32 Acoustics A flute produces sound when a stream of air directed across a hole in the instrument creates a vibration of air at the hole 33 34 The airstream creates a Bernoulli or siphon This excites the air contained in the usually cylindrical resonant cavity within the flute The flutist changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes in the body of the instrument thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency By varying the air pressure a flutist can also change the pitch by causing the air in the flute to resonate at a harmonic rather than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any holes 35 Head joint geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone 36 but there is no clear consensus on a particular shape amongst manufacturers Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter 37 Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include chimney length hole between lipplate and head tube chimney diameter and radii or curvature of the ends of the chimney and any designed restriction in the throat of the instrument such as that in the Japanese Nohkan Flute A study in which professional flutists were blindfolded could find no significant differences between flutes made from a variety of metals 38 In two different sets of blind listening no flute was correctly identified in a first listening and in a second only the silver flute was identified The study concluded that there was no evidence that the wall material has any appreciable effect on the sound color or dynamic range Categories Main article Fipple flutes Playing the zampoña a PreInca instrument and type of pan flute In its most basic form a flute is an open tube which is blown into After focused study and training players use controlled airdirection to create an airstream in which the air is aimed downward into the tone hole of the flutes headjoint There are several broad classes of flutes With most flutes the musician blows directly across the edge of the mouthpiece with 14 of their bottom lip covering the embouchure hole However some flutes such as the whistle gemshorn flageolet recorder tin whistle tonette fujara and ocarina have a duct that directs the air onto the edge an arrangement that is termed a fipple These are known as fipple flutes The fipple gives the instrument a distinct timbre which is different from nonfipple flutes and makes the instrument easier to play but takes a degree of control away from the musician Another division is between sideblown or transverse flutes such as the Western concert flute piccolo fife dizi and bansuri and endblown flutes such as the ney xiao kaval danso shakuhachi Anasazi flute and quena The player of a sideblown flute uses a hole on the side of the tube to produce a tone instead of blowing on an end of the tube Endblown flutes should not be confused with fipple flutes such as the recorder which are also played vertically but have an internal duct to direct the air flow across the edge of the tone hole Flutes may be open at one or both ends The ocarina xun pan pipes police whistle and bosuns whistle are closedended Openended flutes such as the concert flute and the recorder have more harmonics and thus more flexibility for the player and brighter timbres An organ pipe may be either open or closed depending on the sound desired Flutes may have any number of pipes or tubes though one is the most common number Flutes with multiple resonators may be played one resonator at a time as is typical with pan pipes or more than one at a time as is typical with double flutes Flutes can be played with several different air sources Conventional flutes are blown with the mouth although some cultures use nose flutes The flue pipes of organs which are acoustically similar to duct flutes are blown by bellows or fans Western transverse flutes Main article Western concert flute Western concert flute Wooden onekeyed transverse flute Usually in D wooden transverse flutes were played in European classical music mainly in the period from the early 18th century to the early 19th century As such the instrument is often indicated as baroque flute Gradually marginalized by the Western concert flute in the 19th century baroque flutes were again played from the late 20th century as part of the historically informed performance practice Western concert flute An illustration of a Western concert flute The Western concert flute a descendant of the medieval German flute is a transverse treble flute that is closed at the top An embouchure hole is positioned near the top across and into which the flutist blows The flute has circular tone holes larger than the finger holes of its baroque predecessors The size and placement of tone holes key mechanism and fingering system used to produce the notes in the flutes range were evolved from 1832 to 1847 by Theobald Boehm and greatly improved the instruments dynamic range and intonation over its predecessors 39 With some refinements and the rare exception of the Kingma system and other custom adapted fingering systems Western concert flutes typically conform to Boehms design known as the Boehm system Beginners flutes are made of nickel silver or brass that is silverplated while professionals use solid silver gold and sometimes platinum flutes There are also modern woodenbodied flutes usually with silver or gold keywork The wood is usually African Blackwood The standard concert flute is pitched in C and has a range of three octaves starting from middle C or one half step lower when a B foot is attached This means the concert flute is one of the highest common orchestra and concert band instruments Western concert flute variants Center Piccolo Right larger flute The piccolo plays an octave higher than the regular treble flute Lower members of the flute family include the G alto and C bass flutes that are used occasionally and are pitched a perfect fourth and an octave below the concert flute respectively The contrabass double contrabass and hyperbass are other rare forms of the flute pitched two three and four octaves below middle C respectively Other sizes of flutes and piccolos are used from time to time A rarer instrument of the modern pitching system is the treble G flute Instruments made according to an older pitch standard used principally in windband music include D piccolo soprano flute the primary instrument equivalent to todays concert C flute F alto flute and B bass flute Indian flutes Further information Bansuri and Venu A Carnatic eightholed bamboo flute An eightholed classical Indian bamboo flute The bamboo flute is an important instrument in Indian classical music and developed independently of the Western flute The Hindu God Lord Krishna is traditionally considered a master of the bamboo flute The Indian flutes are very simple compared to the Western counterparts they are made of bamboo and are keyless 40 Two main varieties of Indian flutes are currently used The first the Bansuri बसर has six finger holes and one embouchure hole and is used predominantly in the Hindustani music of Northern India The second the Venu or Pullanguzhal has eight finger holes and is played predominantly in the Carnatic music of Southern India Presently the eightholed flute with crossfingering technique is common among many Carnatic flutists Prior to this the South Indian flute had only seven finger holes with the fingering standard developed by Sharaba Shastri of the Palladam school at the beginning of the 20th century 41 Temple car carving of Krishna playing flute suchindram Tamil Nadu India The quality of the flutes sound depends somewhat on the specific bamboo used to make it and it is generally agreed that the best bamboo grows in the Nagercoil area of South India 42 Based on Bharata Natya Shastra Sarana Chatushtai Avinash Balkrishna Patwardhan in 1998 developed a methodology to produce perfectly tuned flutes for the ten thatas currently present in Indian Classical Music 43 In a regional dialect of Gujarati a flute is also called Pavo 44 Some people can also play pair of flutes Jodiyo Pavo simultaneously Chinese flutes Main article Chinese flutes In China there are many varieties of dizi 笛子 or Chinese flute with different sizes structures with or without a resonance membrane and number of holes from 6 to 11 and intonations different keys Most are made of bamboo but can come in wood jade bone and iron One peculiar feature of the Chinese flute is the use of a resonance membrane mounted on one of the holes that vibrates with the air column inside the tube This membrane is called a di mo which is usually a thin tissue paper It gives the flute a bright sound Commonly seen flutes in the modern Chinese orchestra are the bangdi 梆笛 qudi 曲笛 xindi 新笛 and dadi 大笛 The bamboo flute played vertically is called the xiao 簫 which is a different category of wind instrument in China Japanese flutes Main article Fue The Japanese flute called the fue 笛 hiragana ふえ encompasses a large number of musical flutes from Japan include the endblown shakuhachi and hotchiku as well as the transverse gakubue komabue ryūteki nōkan shinobue kagurabue and minteki Sodina and suling A sodina player in Madagascar The sodina is an endblown flute found throughout the island state of Madagascar located in the Indian Ocean off southeastern Africa One of the oldest instruments on the island it bears close resemblance to endblown flutes found in Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia where it is known as the suling suggesting the predecessor to the sodina was carried to Madagascar in outrigger canoes by the islands original settlers emigrating from Borneo 45 An image of the most celebrated contemporary sodina flutist Rakoto Frah d 2001 was featured on the local currency 46 Sring The sring also called blul is a relatively small endblown flute with a nasal tone quality 47 found in the Caucasus region of Eastern Armenia It is made of wood or cane usually with seven finger holes and one thumb hole 47 producing a diatonic scale One Armenian musicologist believes the sring to be the most characteristic of national Armenian instruments 48 See also Bansuri Flute method Diple Frula Hand flute Irish flute Jazz flute Native American flute Palendag Pipe and
