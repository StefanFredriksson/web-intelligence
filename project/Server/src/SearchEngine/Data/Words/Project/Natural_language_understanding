Naturallanguage understanding Naturallanguage understanding NLU or naturallanguage interpretation NLI 1 is a subtopic of naturallanguage processing in artificial intelligence that deals with machine reading comprehension Naturallanguage understanding is considered an AIhard problem 2 There is considerable commercial interest in the field because of its application to automated reasoning 3 machine

6 7 8 9 10 Eight years after John McCarthy coined the term artificial intelligence Bobrows dissertation titled Natural Language Input for a Computer Problem Solving System showed how a computer could understand simple natural language input to solve algebra word problems A year later in 1965 Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT wrote ELIZA an interactive program that carried on a dialogue in English on any topic the most popular being psychotherapy ELIZA worked by simple parsing and substitution of key words into canned phrases and Weizenbaum sidestepped the problem of giving the program a database of realworld knowledge or a rich lexicon Yet ELIZA gained surprising popularity as a toy project and can be seen as a very early precursor to current commercial systems such as those used by Askcom 11 In 1969 Roger Schank at Stanford University introduced the conceptual dependency theory for naturallanguage understanding 12 This model partially influenced by the work of Sydney Lamb was extensively used by Schanks students at Yale University such as Robert Wilensky Wendy Lehnert and Janet Kolodner In 1970 William A Woods introduced the augmented transition network ATN to represent natural language input 13 Instead of phrase structure rules ATNs used an equivalent set of finite state automata that were called recursively ATNs and their more general format called generalized ATNs continued to be used for a number of years In 1971 Terry Winograd finished writing SHRDLU for his PhD thesis at MIT SHRDLU could understand simple English sentences in a restricted world of childrens blocks to direct a robotic arm to move items The successful demonstration of SHRDLU provided significant momentum for continued research in the field 14 15 Winograd continued to be a major influence in the field with the publication of his book Language as a Cognitive Process 16 At Stanford Winograd would later be the adviser for Larry Page who cofounded Google In the 1970s and 1980s the natural language processing group at SRI International continued research and development in the field A number of commercial efforts based on the research were undertaken eg in 1982 Gary Hendrix formed Symantec Corporation originally as a company for developing a natural language interface for database queries on personal computers However with the advent of mouse driven graphic user interfaces Symantec changed direction A number of other commercial efforts were started around the same time eg Larry R Harris at the Artificial Intelligence Corporation and Roger Schank and his students at Cognitive Systems corp 17 18 In 1983 Michael Dyer developed the BORIS system at Yale which bore similarities to the work of Roger Schank and W G Lehnert 19 The third millennium saw the introduction of systems using machine learning for text classification such as the IBM Watson However it is debated how much understanding such systems demonstrate eg according to John Searle Watson did not even understand the questions 20 John Ball cognitive scientist and inventor of Patom Theory supports this assessment Natural language processing has made inroads for applications to support human productivity in service and ecommerce but this has largely been made possible by narrowing the scope of the application There are thousands of ways to request something in a human language which still defies conventional natural language processing To have a meaningful conversation with machines is only possible when we match every word to the correct meaning based on the meanings of the other words in the sentence just like a 3yearold does without guesswork Patom Theory Scope and context edit The umbrella term naturallanguage understanding can be applied to a diverse set of computer applications ranging from small relatively simple tasks such as short commands issued to robots to highly complex endeavors such as the full comprehension of newspaper articles or poetry passages Many real world applications fall between the two extremes for instance text classification for the automatic analysis of emails and their routing to a suitable department in a corporation does not require in depth understanding of the text 21 but needs to deal with a much larger vocabulary and more diverse syntax than the management of simple queries to database tables with fixed schemata Throughout the years various attempts at processing natural language or Englishlike sentences presented to computers have taken place at varying degrees of complexity Some attempts have not resulted in systems with deep understanding but have helped overall system usability For example Wayne Ratliff originally developed the Vulcan program with an Englishlike syntax to mimic the English speaking computer in Star Trek Vulcan later became the dBase system whose easytouse syntax effectively launched the personal computer database industry 22 23 Systems with an easy to use or English like syntax are however quite distinct from systems that use a rich lexicon and include an internal representation often as first order logic of the semantics of natural language sentences Hence the breadth and depth of understanding aimed at by a system determine both the complexity of the system and the implied challenges and the types of applications it can deal with The breadth of a system is measured by the sizes of its vocabulary and grammar The depth is measured by the degree to which its understanding approximates that of a fluent native speaker At the narrowest and shallowest Englishlike command interpreters require minimal complexity but have a small range of applications Narrow but deep systems explore and model mechanisms of understanding 24 but they still have limited application Systems that attempt to understand the contents of a document such as a news release beyond simple keyword matching and to judge its suitability for a user are broader and require significant complexity 25 but they are still somewhat shallow Systems that are both very broad and very deep are beyond the current state of the art Components and architecture edit Regardless of the approach used most naturallanguageunderstanding systems share some common components The system needs a lexicon of the language and a parser and grammar rules to break sentences into an internal representation The construction of a rich lexicon with a suitable ontology requires significant effort eg the Wordnet lexicon required many personyears of effort 26 The system also needs theory from semantics to guide the comprehension The interpretation capabilities of a languageunderstanding system depend on the semantic theory it uses Competing semantic theories of language have specific tradeoffs in their suitability as the basis of computerautomated semantic interpretation 27 These range from naive semantics or stochastic semantic analysis to the use of pragmatics to derive meaning from context 28 29 30 Semantic parsers convert naturallanguage texts into formal meaning representations 31 Advanced applications of naturallanguage understanding also attempt to incorporate logical inference within their framework This is generally achieved by mapping the derived meaning into a set of assertions in predicate logic then using logical deduction to arrive at conclusions Therefore systems based on functional languages such as Lisp need to include a subsystem to represent logical assertions while logicoriented systems such as those using the language Prolog generally rely on an extension of the builtin logical representation framework 32 33 The management of context in naturallanguage understanding can present special challenges A large variety of examples and counter examples have resulted in multiple approaches to the formal modeling of context each with specific strengths and weaknesses 34 35 See also edit Computational semantics Discourse representation theory Deep linguistic
