to Alfred Marshall from political economy to economics as a shorter term for economic science At that time it became more open to rigorous thinking and made increased use of mathematics which helped support efforts to have it accepted as a science and as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences a 16 17 18 There are a variety of modern definitions of economics some reflect evolving views of the subject or different views among economists 19 20 Scottish philosopher Adam Smith 1776 defined what was then called political economy as an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations in particular as mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator with the twofold objectives of providing a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people and to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the publick services 21 JeanBaptiste Say 1803 distinguishing the subject from its publicpolicy uses defines it as the science of production distribution and consumption of wealth 22 On the satirical side Thomas Carlyle 1849 coined the dismal science as an epithet for classical economics in this context commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of Malthus 1798 23 John Stuart Mill 1844 defines the subject in a social context as The science which traces the laws of such of the phenomena of society as arise from the combined operations of mankind for the production of wealth in so far as those phenomena are not modified by the pursuit of any other object 24 Alfred Marshall provides a still widely cited definition in his textbook Principles of Economics 1890 that extends analysis beyond wealth and from the societal to the microeconomic level Economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it Thus it is on the one side the study of wealth and on the other and more important side a part of the study of man 25 Lionel Robbins 1932 developed implications of what has been termed perhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject 20 Economics is a science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses 26 Robbins describes the definition as not classificatory in picking out certain kinds of behaviour but rather analytical in focusing attention on a particular aspect of behaviour the form imposed by the influence of scarcity 27 He affirmed that previous economists have usually centred their studies on the analysis of wealth how wealth is created production distributed and consumed and how wealth can grow 28 But he said that economics can be used to study other things such as war that are outside its usual focus This is because war has as the goal winning it as a sought after end generates both cost and benefits and resources human life and other costs are used to attain the goal If the war is not winnable or if the expected costs outweigh the benefits the deciding actors assuming they are rational may never go to war a decision but rather explore other alternatives We cannot define economics as the science that studies wealth war crime education and any other field economic analysis can be applied to but as the science that studies a particular common aspect of each of those subjects they all use scarce resources to attain a sought after end Some subsequent comments criticized the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets From the 1960s however such comments abated as the economic theory of maximizing behaviour and rationalchoice modelling expanded the domain of the subject to areas previously treated in other fields 29 There are other criticisms as well such as in scarcity not accounting for the macroeconomics of high unemployment 30 Gary Becker a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas describes the approach he favours as combining the assumptions of maximizing behaviour stable preferences and market equilibrium used relentlessly and unflinchingly 31 One commentary characterizes the remark as making economics an approach rather than a subject matter but with great specificity as to the choice process and the type of social interaction that such analysis involves The same source reviews a range of definitions included in principles of economics textbooks and concludes that the lack of agreement need not affect the subjectmatter that the texts treat Among economists more generally it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving or should evolve 20 History Main articles History of economic thought and History of macroeconomic thought Economic writings date from earlier Mesopotamian Greek Roman Indian subcontinent Chinese Persian and Arab civilizations Economic precepts occur throughout the writings of the Boeotian poet Hesiod and several economic historians have described Hesiod himself as the first economist 32 Other notable writers from Antiquity through to the Renaissance include Aristotle Xenophon Chanakya also known as Kautilya Qin Shi Huang Thomas Aquinas and Ibn Khaldun Joseph Schumpeter described Aquinas as coming nearer than any other group to being the founders of scientific economics as to monetary interest and value theory within a naturallaw perspective 33 failed verification A 1638 painting of a French seaport during the heyday of mercantilism Two groups later called mercantilists and physiocrats more directly influenced the subsequent development of the subject Both groups were associated with the rise of economic nationalism and modern capitalism in Europe Mercantilism was an economic doctrine that flourished from the 16th to 18th century in a prolific pamphlet literature whether of merchants or statesmen It held that a nations wealth depended on its accumulation of gold and silver Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver The doctrine called for importing cheap raw materials to be used in manufacturing goods which could be exported and for state regulation to impose protective tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit manufacturing in the colonies 34 Physiocrats a group of 18thcentury French thinkers and writers developed the idea of the economy as a circular flow of income and output Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth Thus they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture including import tariffs Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations the physiocrats advocated a policy of laissezfaire which called for minimal government intervention in the economy 35 Adam Smith 17231790 was an early economic theorist 36 Smith was harshly critical of the mercantilists but described the physiocratic system with all its imperfections as perhaps the purest approximation to the truth that has yet been published on the subject 37 Classical political economy Main article Classical economics The publication of Adam Smith s The Wealth of Nations in 1776 is considered to be the first formalisation of economic thought The publication of Adam Smiths The Wealth of Nations in 1776 has been described as the effective birth of economics as a separate discipline 38 The book identified land labour and capital as the three factors of production and the major contributors to a nations wealth as distinct from the physiocratic idea that only agriculture was productive Smith discusses potential benefits of specialization by division of labour including increased labour productivity and gains from trade whether between town and country or across countries 39 His theorem that the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market has been described as the core of a theory of the functions of firm and industry and a fundamental principle of economic organization 40 To Smith has also been ascribed the most important substantive proposition in all of economics and foundation of resourceallocation theory that under competition resource owners of labour land and capital seek their most profitable uses resulting in an equal rate of return for all uses in equilibrium adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training and unemployment 41 In an argument that includes one of the most famous passages in all economics 42 Smith represents every individual as trying to employ any capital they might command for their own advantage not that of the society b and for the sake of profit which is necessary at some level for employing capital in domestic industry and positively related to the value of produce 44 In this He generally indeed neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it 45 The Rev Thomas Robert Malthus 1798 used the concept of diminishing returns to explain low living standards Human population he argued tended to increase geometrically outstripping the production of food which increased arithmetically The force of a rapidly growing population against a limited amount of land meant diminishing returns to labour The result he claimed was chronically low wages which prevented the standard of living for most of the population from rising above the subsistence level 46 Economist Julian Lincoln Simon has criticized Malthuss conclusions 47 While Adam Smith emphasized the production of income David Ricardo 1817 focused on the distribution of income among landowners workers and capitalists Ricardo saw an inherent conflict between landowners on the one hand and labour and capital on the other He posited that the growth of population and capital pressing against a fixed supply of land pushes up rents and holds down wages and profits Ricardo was the first to state and prove the principle of comparative advantage according to which each country should specialize in producing and exporting goods in that it has a lower relative cost of production rather relying only on its own production 48 It has been termed a fundamental analytical explanation for gains from trade 49 Coming at the end of the classical tradition John Stuart Mill 1848 parted company with the earlier classical economists on the inevitability of the distribution of income produced by the market system Mill pointed to a distinct difference between the markets two roles allocation of resources and distribution of income The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income he wrote making it necessary for society to intervene 50 Value theory was important in classical theory Smith wrote that the real price of every thing is the toil and trouble of acquiring it Smith maintained that with rent and profit other costs besides wages also enter the price of a commodity 51 Other classical economists presented variations on Smith termed the labour theory of value Classical economics focused on the tendency of any market economy to settle in a final stationary state made up of a constant stock of physical wealth capital and a constant population size Marxism Main article Marxian economics The Marxist school of economic thought comes from the work of German economist Karl Marx Marxist later Marxian economics descends from classical economics and it derives from the work of Karl Marx The first volume of Marxs major work Das Kapital was published in German in 1867 In it Marx focused on the labour theory of value and the theory of surplus value which he believed explained the exploitation of labour by capital 52 The labour theory of value held that the value of an exchanged commodity was determined by the labour that went into its production and the theory of surplus value demonstrated how the workers only got paid a proportion of the value their work had created 53 Neoclassical economics Main article Neoclassical economics At the dawn as a social science economics was defined and discussed at length as the study of production distribution and consumption of wealth by JeanBaptiste Say in his Treatise on Political Economy or The Production Distribution and Consumption of Wealth 1803 These three items are considered by the science only in relation to the increase or diminution of wealth and not in reference to their processes of execution c Says definition has prevailed up to our time saved by substituting the word wealth for goods and services meaning that wealth may include nonmaterial objects as well One hundred and thirty years later Lionel Robbins noticed that this definition no longer sufficed d because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity In his Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science he proposed a definition of economics as a study of a particular aspect of human behaviour the one that falls under the influence of scarcity e which forces people to choose allocate scarce resources to competing ends and economize seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources For Robbins the insufficiency was solved and his definition allows us to proclaim with an easy conscience education economics safety and security economics health economics war economics and of course production distribution and consumption economics as valid subjects of the economic science Citing Robbins Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses 27 After discussing it for decades Robbins definition became widely accepted by mainstream economists and it has opened way into current textbooks 54 Although far from unanimous most mainstream economists would accept some version of Robbins definition even though many have raised serious objections to the scope and method of economics emanating from that definition 55 Due to the lack of strong consensus and that production distribution and consumption of goods and services is the prime area of study of economics the old definition still stands in many quarters A body of theory later termed neoclassical economics or marginalism formed from about 1870 to 1910 The term economics was popularized by such neoclassical economists as Alfred Marshall as a concise synonym for economic science and a substitute for the earlier political economy 17 18 This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences 56 Neoclassical economics systematized supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income It dispensed with the labour theory of value inherited from classical economics in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side 57 In the 20th century neoclassical theorists moved away from an earlier notion suggesting that total utility for a society could be measured in favour of ordinal utility which hypothesizes merely behaviourbased relations across persons 58 59 In microeconomics neoclassical economics represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping decision making An immediate example of this is the consumer theory of individual demand which isolates how prices as costs and income affect quantity demanded 58 In macroeconomics it is reflected in an early and lasting neoclassical synthesis with Keynesian macroeconomics 60 58 Neoclassical economics is occasionally referred as orthodox economics whether by its critics or sympathizers Modern mainstream economics builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalize earlier analysis such as econometrics game theory analysis of market failure and imperfect competition and the neoclassical model of economic growth for analysing longrun variables affecting national income Neoclassical economics studies the behaviour of individuals households and organizations called economic actors players or agents when they manage or use scarce resources which have alternative uses to achieve desired ends Agents are assumed to act rationally have multiple desirable ends in sight limited resources to obtain these ends a set of stable preferences a definite overall guiding objective and the capability of making a choice There exists an economic problem subject to study by economic science when a decision choice is made by one or more resourcecontrolling players to attain the best possible outcome under bounded rational conditions In other words resourcecontrolling agents maximize value subject to the constraints imposed by the information the agents have their cognitive limitations and the finite amount of time they have to make and execute a decision Economic science centres on the activities of the economic agents that comprise society 61 They are the focus of economic analysis f An approach to understanding these processes through the study of agent behaviour under scarcity may go as follows The continuous interplay exchange or trade done by economic actors in all markets sets the prices for all goods and services which in turn make the rational managing of scarce resources possible At the same time the decisions choices made by the same actors while they are pursuing their own interest determine the level of output production consumption savings and investment in an economy as well as the remuneration distribution paid to the owners of labour in the form of wages capital in the form of profits and land in the form of rent g Each period as if they were in a giant feedback system economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state equilibrium of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents the economy is a complex adaptive system h Keynesian economics Main articles Keynesian economics and PostKeynesian economics John Maynard Keynes right was a key theorist in economics Keynesian economics derives from John Maynard Keynes in particular his book The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money 1936 which ushered in contemporary macroeconomics as a distinct field 62 The book focused on determinants of national income in the short run when prices are relatively inflexible Keynes attempted to explain in broad theoretical detail why high labourmarket unemployment might not be selfcorrecting due to low effective demand and why even price flexibility and monetary policy might be unavailing The term revolutionary has been applied to the book in its impact on economic analysis 63 Keynesian economics has two successors PostKeynesian economics also concentrates on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes Research on micro foundations for their models is represented as based on reallife practices rather than simple optimizing models It is generally associated with the University of Cambridge and the work of Joan Robinson 64 NewKeynesian economics is also associated with developments in the Keynesian fashion Within this group researchers tend to share with other economists the emphasis on models employing micro foundations and optimizing behaviour but with a narrower focus on standard Keynesian themes such as price and wage rigidity These are usually made to be endogenous features of the models rather than simply assumed as in older Keynesianstyle ones Chicago school of economics Main article Chicago school of economics The Chicago School of economics is best known for its free market advocacy and monetarist ideas According to Milton Friedman and monetarists market economies are inherently stable if the money supply does not greatly expand or contract Ben Bernanke former Chairman of the Federal Reserve is among the economists today generally accepting Friedmans analysis of the causes of the Great Depression 65 Milton Friedman effectively took many of the basic principles set forth by Adam Smith and the classical economists and modernized them One example of this is his article in the 13 September 1970 issue of The New York Times Magazine in which he claims that the social responsibility of business should be to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits through open and free competition without deception or fraud 66 Other schools and approaches Main article Schools of economics Other wellknown schools or trends of thought referring to a particular style of economics practised at and disseminated from welldefined groups of academicians that have become known worldwide include the Austrian School the Freiburg School the School of Lausanne postKeynesian economics and the Stockholm school Contemporary mainstream economics is sometimes separated into the Saltwater approach of those universities along the Eastern and Western coasts of the US and the Freshwater or Chicagoschool approach Within macroeconomics there is in general order of their appearance in the literature classical economics Keynesian economics the neoclassical synthesis postKeynesian economics monetarism new classical economics and supplyside economics Alternative developments include ecological economics constitutional economics institutional economics evolutionary economics dependency theory structuralist economics world systems theory econophysics feminist economics and biophysical economics 67 Economic systems Main article Economic system Economic systems is the branch of economics that studies the methods and institutions by which societies determine the ownership direction and allocation of economic resources An economic system of a society is the unit of analysis Among contemporary systems at different ends of the organizational spectrum are socialist systems and capitalist systems in which most production occurs in respectively staterun and private enterprises In between are mixed economies A common element is the interaction of economic and political influences broadly described as political economy Comparative economic systems studies the relative performance and behaviour of different economies or systems 68 The US ExportImport Bank defines a MarxistLeninist state as having a centrally planned economy 53 They are now rare examples can still be seen in Cuba North Korea and Laos 69 needs update Theory Mainstream economic theory relies upon a priori quantitative economic models which employ a variety of concepts Theory typically proceeds with an assumption of ceteris paribus which means holding constant explanatory variables other than the one under consideration When creating theories the objective is to find ones which are at least as simple in information requirements more precise in predictions and more fruitful in generating additional research than prior theories 70 While neoclassical economic theory constitutes both the dominant or orthodox theoretical as well as methodological framework economic theory can also take the form of other schools of thought such as in heterodox economic theories In microeconomics principal concepts include supply and demand marginalism rational choice theory opportunity cost budget constraints utility and the theory of the firm 71 Early macroeconomic models focused on modelling the relationships between aggregate variables but as the relationships appeared to change over time macroeconomists including new Keynesians reformulated their models in microfoundations 72 The aforementioned microeconomic concepts play a major part in macroeconomic models for instance in monetary theory the quantity theory of money predicts that increases in the growth rate of the money supply increase inflation and inflation is assumed to be influenced by rational expectations In development economics slower growth in developed nations has been sometimes predicted because of the declining marginal returns of investment and capital and this has been observed in the Four Asian Tigers Sometimes an economic hypothesis is only qualitative not quantitative 73 Expositions of economic reasoning often use twodimensional graphs to illustrate theoretical relationships At a higher level of generality Paul Samuelson s treatise Foundations of Economic Analysis 1947 used mathematical methods beyond graphs to represent the theory particularly as to maximizing behavioural relations of agents reaching equilibrium The book focused on examining the class of statements called operationally meaningful theorems in economics which are theorems that can conceivably be refuted by empirical data 74 Branches of economics Microeconomics Main articles Microeconomics and Market economics Economists study trade production and consumption decisions such as those that occur in a traditional marketplace Electronic trading brings together buyers and sellers through an electronic trading platform and network to create virtual market places Pictured São Paulo Stock Exchange Brazil Microeconomics examines how entities forming a market structure interact within a market to create a market system These entities include private and public players with various classifications typically operating under scarcity of tradable units and light government regulation clarification needed The item traded may be a tangible product such as apples or a service such as repair services legal counsel or entertainment In theory in a free market the aggregates sum of of quantity demanded by buyers and quantity supplied by sellers may reach economic equilibrium over time in reaction to price changes in practice various issues may prevent equilibrium and any equilibrium reached may not necessarily be morally equitable For example if the supply of healthcare services is limited by external factors the equilibrium price may be unaffordable for many who desire it but cannot pay for it Various market structures exist In perfectly competitive markets no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product In other words every participant is a price taker as no participant influences the price of a product In the real world markets often experience imperfect competition Forms include monopoly in which there is only one seller of a good duopoly in which there are only two sellers of a good oligopoly in which there are few sellers of a good monopolistic competition in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods monopsony in which there is only one buyer of a good and oligopsony in which there are few buyers of a good Unlike perfect competition imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be price makers which means that by holding a disproportionately high share of market power they can influence the prices of their products Microeconomics studies individual markets by simplifying the economic system by assuming that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets This method of analysis is known as partialequilibrium analysis supply and demand This method aggregates the sum of all activity in only one market Generalequilibrium theory studies various markets and their behaviour It aggregates the sum of all activity across all markets This method studies both changes in markets and their interactions leading towards equilibrium 75 Production cost and efficiency Main articles Production economics Opportunity cost Economic efficiency and Productionpossibility frontier In microeconomics production is the conversion of inputs into outputs It is an economic process that uses inputs to create a commodity or a service for exchange or direct use Production is a flow and thus a rate of output per period of time Distinctions include such production alternatives as for consumption food haircuts etc vs investment goods new tractors buildings roads etc public goods national defence smallpox vaccinations etc or private goods new computers bananas etc and guns vs butter Opportunity cost is the economic cost of production the value of the next best opportunity foregone Choices must be made between desirable yet mutually exclusive actions It has been described as expressing the basic relationship between scarcity and choice 76 For example if a baker uses a sack of flour to make pretzels one morning then the baker cannot use either the flour or the morning to make bagels instead Part of the cost of making pretzels is that neither the flour nor the morning are available any longer for use in some other way The opportunity cost of an activity is an element in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently such that the cost is weighed against the value of that activity in deciding on more or less of it Opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs but could be measured by the real cost of output forgone leisure or anything else that provides the alternative benefit utility 77 Inputs used in the production process include such primary factors of production as labour services capital durable produced goods used in production such as an existing factory and land including natural resources Other inputs may include intermediate goods used in production of final goods such as the steel in a new car Economic efficiency measures how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available technology Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs or in other words the amount of waste is reduced A widely accepted general standard is Pareto efficiency which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making someone else worse off An example productionpossibility frontier with illustrative points marked The productionpossibility frontier PPF is an expository figure for representing scarcity cost and efficiency In the simplest case an economy can produce just two goods say guns and butter The PPF is a table or graph as at the right showing the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs which limit feasible total output Each point on the curve shows potential total output for the economy which is the maximum feasible output of one good given a feasible output quantity of the other good Scarcity is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume beyond the PPF such as at X and by the negative slope of the curve 78 If production of one good increases along the curve production of the other good decreases an inverse relationship This is because increasing output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good decreasing the latter The slope of the curve at a point on it gives the tradeoff between the two goods It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good an example of a real opportunity cost Thus if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter Along the PPF scarcity implies that choosing more of one good in the aggregate entails doing with less of the other good Still in a market economy movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents By construction each point on the curve shows productive efficiency in maximizing output for given total inputs A point inside the curve as at A is feasible but represents production inefficiency wasteful use of inputs in that output of one or both goods could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point on the curve Examples cited of such inefficiency include high unemployment during a businesscycle recession or economic organization of a country that discourages full use of resources Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy allocative efficiency also called Pareto efficiency if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points Much applied economics in public policy is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved Recognizing the reality of scarcity and then figuring out how to organize society for the most efficient use of resources has been described as the essence of economics where the subject makes its unique contribution 79 Specialization Main articles Division of labour Comparative advantage and Gains from trade A map showing the main trade routes for goods within late medieval Europe Specialization is considered key to economic efficiency based on theoretical and empirical considerations Different individuals or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production say from differences in stocks of human capital per worker or capital labour ratios According to theory this may give a comparative advantage in production of goods that make more intensive use of the relatively more abundant thus relatively cheaper input Even if one region has an absolute advantage as to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output it may still specialize in the output in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but has a comparative advantage in producing something else It has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs including highincome countries This has led to investigation of economies of scale and agglomeration to explain specialization in similar but differentiated product lines to the overall benefit of respective trading parties or regions 80 The general theory of specialization applies to trade among individuals farms manufacturers service providers and economies Among each of these production systems there may be a corresponding division of labour with different work groups specializing or correspondingly different types of capital equipment and differentiated land uses 81 An example that combines features above is a country that specializes in the production of hightech knowledge products as developed countries do and trades with developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is relatively cheap and plentiful resulting in different in opportunity costs of production More total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its own hightech and lowtech products Theory and observation set out the conditions such that market prices of outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage so that relatively lowcost inputs go to producing lowcost outputs In the process aggregate output may increase as a byproduct or by design 82 Such specialization of production creates opportunities for gains from trade whereby resource owners benefit from trade in the sale of one type of output for other more highly valued goods A measure of gains from trade is the increased income levels that trade may facilitate 83 Supply and demand Main article Supply and demand The supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand The graph depicts an increase that is rightshift in demand from D 1 to D 2 along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new equilibrium point on the supply curve S Prices and quantities have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy 84 The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed In microeconomics it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have pricesetting power For a given market of a commodity demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded as in the figure Demand theory describes individual consumers as rationally choosing the most preferred quantity of each good given income prices tastes etc A term for this is constrained utility maximization with income and wealth as the constraints on demand Here utility refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred The law of demand states that in general price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related That is the higher the price of a product the less of it people would be prepared to buy other things unchanged As the price of a commodity falls consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods the substitution effect In addition purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy the income effect Other factors can change demand for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a normal good outward relative to the origin as in the figure All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply Supply is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied Producers for example business firms are hypothesized to be profit maximizers meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity if other factors are unchanged That is the higher the price at which the good can be sold the more of it producers will supply as in the figure The higher price makes it profitable to increase production Just as on the demand side the position of the supply can shift say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement The Law of Supply states that in general a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply Here as well the determinants of supply such as price of substitutes cost of production technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply Market equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above At a price below equilibrium there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded This is posited to bid the price up At a price above equilibrium there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded This pushes the price down The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded Similarly demandandsupply theory predicts a new pricequantity combination from a shift in demand as to the figure or in supply Firms Main articles Theory of the firm Industrial organization Business economics and Managerial economics People frequently do not trade directly on markets Instead on the supply side they may work in and produce through firms The most obvious kinds of firms are corporations partnerships and trusts According to Ronald Coase people begin to organize their production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market 85 Firms combine labour and capital and can achieve far greater economies of scale when the average cost per unit declines as more units are produced than individual market trading In perfectly competitive markets studied in the theory of supply and demand there are many producers none of which significantly influence price Industrial organization generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behaviour of firms that do have significant control of price It considers the structure of such markets and their interactions Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition various forms of oligopoly and monopoly 86 Managerial economics applies microeconomic analysis to specific decisions in business firms or other management units It draws heavily from quantitative methods such as operations research and programming and from statistical methods such as regression analysis in the absence of certainty and perfect knowledge A unifying theme is the attempt to optimize business decisions including unitcost minimization and profit maximization given the firms objectives and constraints imposed by technology and market conditions 87 Uncertainty and game theory Main articles Information economics Game theory and Financial economics Uncertainty in economics is an unknown prospect of gain or loss whether quantifiable as risk or not Without it household behaviour would be unaffected by uncertain employment and income prospects financial and capital markets would reduce to exchange of a single instrument in each market period and there would be no communications industry 88 Given its different forms there are various ways of representing uncertainty and modelling economic agents responses to it 89 Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that considers strategic interactions between agents one kind of uncertainty It provides a mathematical foundation of industrial organization discussed above to model different types of firm behaviour for example in an solipsistic industry few sellers but equally applicable to wage negotiations bargaining contract design and any situation where individual agents are few enough to have perceptible effects on each other In behavioural economics it has been used to model the strategies agents choose when interacting with others whose interests are at least partially adverse to their own 90 In this it generalizes maximization approaches developed to analyse market actors such as in the supply and demand model and allows for incomplete information of actors The field dates from the 1944 classic Theory of Games and Economic Behavior by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern It has significant applications seemingly outside of economics in such diverse subjects as formulation of nuclear strategies ethics political science and evolutionary biology 91 Risk aversion may stimulate activity that in wellfunctioning markets smooths out risk and communicates information about risk as in markets for insurance commodity futures contracts and financial instruments Financial economics or simply finance describes the allocation of financial resources It also analyses the pricing of financial instruments the financial structure of companies the efficiency and fragility of financial markets 92 financial crises and related government policy or regulation 93 Some market organizations may give rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty Based on George Akerlof s Market for Lemons article the paradigm example is of a dodgy secondhand car market Customers without knowledge of whether a car is a lemon depress its price below what a quality secondhand car would be 94 Information asymmetry arises here if the seller has more relevant information than the buyer but no incentive to disclose it Related problems in insurance are adverse selection such that those at most risk are most likely to insure say reckless drivers and moral hazard such that insurance results in riskier behaviour say more reckless driving 95 Both problems may raise insurance costs and reduce efficiency by driving otherwise willing transactors from the market incomplete markets Moreover attempting to reduce one problem say adverse selection by mandating insurance may add to another say moral hazard Information economics which studies such problems has relevance in subjects such as insurance contract law mechanism design monetary economics and health care 95 Applied subjects include market and legal remedies to spread or reduce risk such as warranties governmentmandated partial insurance restructuring or bankruptcy law inspection and regulation for quality and information disclosure 96 97 Market failure Main articles Market failure Government failure Information economics Environmental economics and Agricultural economics Pollution can be a simple example of market failure If costs of production are not borne by producers but are by the environment accident victims or others then prices are distorted Environmental scientist sampling water The term market failure encompasses several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions Although economists categorize market failures differently the following categories emerge in the main texts i Information asymmetries and incomplete markets may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market legal and regulatory remedies as discussed above Natural monopoly or the overlapping concepts of practical and technical monopoly is an extreme case of failure of competition as a restraint on producers Extreme economies of scale are one possible cause Public goods are goods which are undersupplied in a typical market The defining features are that people can consume public goods without having to pay for them and that more than one person can consume the good at the same time Externalities occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices For example air pollution may generate a negative externality and education may generate a positive externality less crime etc Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities in an effort to correct the price distortions caused by these externalities 98 Elementary demandandsupply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply 99 In many areas some form of price stickiness is postulated to account for quantities rather than prices adjusting in the short run to changes on the demand side or the supply side This includes standard analysis of the business cycle in macroeconomics Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesized longrun equilibrium Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating from perfect competition Some specialized fields of economics deal in market failure more than others The economics of the public sector is one example Much environmental economics concerns externalities or public bads Policy options include regulations that reflect costbenefit analysis or market solutions that change incentives such as emission fees or redefinition of property rights 100 Public sector Main articles Economics of the public sector and Public finance See also Welfare economics Public finance is the field of economics that deals with budgeting the revenues and expenditures of a public sector entity usually government The subject addresses such matters as tax incidence who really pays a particular tax costbenefit analysis of government programmes effects on economic efficiency and income distribution of different kinds of spending and taxes and fiscal politics The latter an aspect of public choice theory models publicsector behaviour analogously to microeconomics involving interactions of selfinterested voters politicians and bureaucrats 101 Much of economics is positive seeking to describe and predict economic phenomena Normative economics seeks to identify what economies ought to be like Welfare economics is a normative branch of economics that uses microeconomic techniques to simultaneously determine the allocative efficiency within an economy and the income distribution associated with it It attempts to measure social welfare by examining the economic activities of the individuals that comprise society 102 Macroeconomics Main article Macroeconomics The circulation of money in an economy in a macroeconomic model Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole to explain broad aggregates and their interactions top down that is using a simplified form of generalequilibrium theory 103 Such aggregates include national income and output the unemployment rate and price inflation and subaggregates like total consumption and investment spending and their components It also studies effects of monetary policy and fiscal policy Since at least the 1960s macroeconomics has been characterized by further integration as to microbased modelling of sectors including rationality of players efficient use of market information and imperfect competition 104 This has addressed a longstanding concern about inconsistent developments of the same subject 105 Macroeconomic analysis also considers factors affecting the longterm level and growth of national income Such factors include capital accumulation technological change and labour force growth 106 Growth Main article Economic growth Growth economics studies factors that explain economic growth the increase in output per capita of a country over a long period of time The same factors are used to explain differences in the level of output per capita between countries in particular why some countries grow faster than others and whether countries converge at the same rates of growth Muchstudied factors include the rate of investment population growth and technological change These are represented in theoretical and empirical forms as in the neoclassical and endogenous growth models and in growth accounting 107 Business cycle Main article Business cycle See also Circular flow of income Aggregate supply Aggregate demand and Unemployment A basic illustration of economicbusiness cycles The economics of a depression were the spur for the creation of macroeconomics as a separate discipline During the Great Depression of the 1930s John Maynard Keynes authored a book entitled The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money outlining the key theories of Keynesian economics Keynes contended that aggregate demand for goods might be insufficient during economic downturns leading to unnecessarily high unemployment and losses of potential output He therefore advocated active policy responses by the public sector including monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government to stabilize output over the business cycle 108 Thus a central conclusion of Keynesian economics is that in some situations no strong automatic mechanism moves output and employment towards full employment levels John Hicks ISLM model has been the most influential interpretation of The General Theory Over the years understanding of the business cycle has branched into various research programmes mostly related to or distinct from Keynesianism The neoclassical synthesis refers to the reconciliation of Keynesian economics with neoclassical economics stating that Keynesianism is correct in the short run but qualified by neoclassicallike considerations in the intermediate and long run 60 New classical macroeconomics as distinct from the Keynesian view of the business cycle posits market clearing with imperfect information It includes Friedmans permanent income hypothesis on consumption and rational expectations theory 109 led by Robert Lucas and real business cycle theory 110 In contrast the new Keynesian approach retains the rational expectations assumption however it assumes a variety of market failures In particular New Keynesians assume prices and wages are sticky which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions 72 Thus the new classicals assume that prices and wages adjust automatically to attain full employment whereas the new Keynesians see full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run and hence government and centralbank policies are needed because the long run may be very long Unemployment Main article Unemployment The percentage of the US population employed 19952012 The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate the percentage of workers without jobs in the labour force The labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs People who are retired pursuing education or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are excluded from the labour force Unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes 111 Classical models of unemployment occurs when wages are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers Consistent with classical unemployment frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment 111 Structural unemployment covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers skills and the skills required for open jobs 112 Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills are no longer in demand Structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process 113 While some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy cyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates Okuns law represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth 114 The original version of Okuns law states that a 3 increase in output would lead to a 1 decrease in unemployment 115 Inflation and monetary policy Main articles Inflation and Monetary policy See also Money Quantity theory of money and History of money Money is a means of final payment for goods in most price system economies and is the unit of account in which prices are typically stated Money has general acceptability relative consistency in value divisibility durability portability elasticity in supply and longevity with mass public confidence It includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits It has been described as a social convention like language useful to one largely because it is useful to others In the words of Francis Amasa Walker a wellknown 19thcentury economist Money is what money does Money is that money does in the original 116 As a medium of exchange money facilitates trade It is essentially a measure of value and more importantly a store of value being a basis for credit creation Its economic function can be contrasted with barter nonmonetary exchange Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers barter may entail a hardtolocate double coincidence of wants as to what is exchanged say apples and a book Money can reduce the transaction cost of exchange because of its ready acceptability Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange rather than what the buyer produces 117 At the level of an economy theory and evidence are consistent with a positive relationship running from the total money supply to the nominal value of total output and to the general price level For this reason management of the money supply is a key aspect of monetary policy 118 Fiscal policy Main articles Fiscal policy Government spending and Taxation Governments implement fiscal policy to influence macroeconomic conditions by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter aggregate demand When aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy there is an output gap where some productive capacity is left unemployed Governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand Resources that have been idled can be used by the government For example unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways Tax cuts allow consumers to increase their spending which boosts aggregate demand Both tax cuts and spending have multiplier effects where the initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by crowding out When there is no output gap the economy is producing at full capacity and there are no excess productive resources If the government increases spending in this situation the government uses resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector so there is no increase in overall output Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed Sceptics of fiscal policy also make the argument of Ricardian equivalence They argue that an increase in debt will have to be paid for with future tax increases which will cause people to reduce their consumption and save money to pay for the future tax increase Under Ricardian equivalence any boost in demand from tax cuts will be offset by the increased saving intended to pay for future higher taxes International economics Main article International economics List of countries by GDP PPP per capita in 2014 International trade studies determinants of goodsandservices flows across international boundaries It also concerns the size and distribution of gains from trade Policy applications include estimating the effects of changing tariff rates and trade quotas International finance is a macroeconomic field which examines the flow of capital across international borders and the effects of these movements on exchange rates Increased trade in goods services and capital between countries is a major effect of contemporary globalization 119 Development economics Main article Development economics Development economics examines economic aspects of the economic development process in relatively lowincome countries focusing on structural change poverty and economic growth Approaches in development economics frequently incorporate social and political factors 120 Labor economics Main article Labor economics Labor economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labor Labor markets function through the interaction of workers and employers Labor economics looks at the suppliers of labor services workers the demands of labor services employers and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages employment and income In economics labor is a measure of the work done by human beings It is conventionally contrasted with such other factors of production as land and capital There are theories which have developed a concept called human capital referring to the skills that workers possess not necessarily their actual work although there are also counter posing macroeconomic system theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms Welfare economics Main article Welfare economics Welfare economics uses microeconomics techniques to evaluate wellbeing from allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy often relative to competitive general equilibrium 121 It analyzes social welfare however measured in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered Accordingly individuals with associated economic activities are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare whether of a group a community or a society and there is no social welfare apart from the welfare associated with its individual units Agreements This article may be unbalanced towards certain viewpoints Please improve the article by adding information on neglected viewpoints or discuss the issue on the talk page February 2017 According to various random and anonymous surveys of members of the American Economic Association economists have agreement about the following propositions by percentage 122 123 124 125 126 A ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available 93 agree Tariffs and import quotas usually reduce general economic welfare 93 agree Flexible and floating exchange rates offer an effective international monetary arrangement 90 agree Fiscal policy eg tax cut andor government expenditure increase has a significant stimulative impact on a less than fully employed economy 90 agree The United States should not restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries 90 agree Economic growth in developed countries like the United States leads to greater levels of wellbeing 88 agree The United States should eliminate agricultural subsidies 85 agree An appropriately designed fiscal policy can increase the longrun rate of capital formation 85 agree Local and state governments should eliminate subsidies to professional sports franchises 85 agree If the federal budget is to be balanced it should be done over the business cycle rather than yearly 85 agree The gap between Social Security funds and expenditures will become unsustainably large within the next fifty years if current policies remain unchanged 85 agree Cash payments increase the welfare of recipients to a greater degree than do transfersinkind of equal cash value 84 agree A large federal budget deficit has an adverse effect on the economy 83 agree The redistribution of income in the United States is a legitimate role for the government 83 agree Inflation is caused primarily by too much growth in the money supply 83 agree The United States should not ban genetically modified crops 82 agree A minimum wage increases unemployment among young and unskilled workers 79 agree The government should restructure the welfare system along the lines of a negative income tax 79 agree Effluent taxes and marketable pollution permits represent a better approach to pollution control than imposition of pollution ceilings 78 agree Government subsidies on ethanol in the United States should be reduced or eliminated 78 agree Criticisms General criticisms The dismal science is a derogatory alternative name for economics devised by the Victorian historian Thomas Carlyle in the 19th century It is often stated that Carlyle gave economics the nickname the dismal science as a response to the late 18th century writings of The Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus who grimly predicted that starvation would result as projected population growth exceeded the rate of increase in the food supply However the actual phrase was coined by Carlyle in the context of a debate with John Stuart Mill on slavery in which Carlyle argued for slavery while Mill opposed it 23 Some economists like John Stuart Mill or Léon Walras have maintained that the production of wealth should not be tied to its distribution 127 In The Wealth of Nations Adam Smith addressed many issues that are currently also the subject of debate and dispute Smith repeatedly attacks groups of politically aligned individuals who attempt to use their collective influence to manipulate a government into doing their bidding In Smiths day these were referred to as factions but are now more commonly called special interests a term which can comprise international bankers corporate conglomerations outright oligopolies monopolies trade unions and other groups j Economics per se as a social science is independent of the political acts of any government or other decisionmaking organization however many policymakers or individuals holding highly ranked positions that can influence other peoples lives are known for arbitrarily using a plethora of economic concepts and rhetoric as vehicles to legitimize agendas and value systems and do not limit their remarks to matters relevant to their responsibilities 128 The close relation of economic theory and practice with politics 129 is a focus of contention that may shade or distort the most unpretentious original tenets of economics and is often confused with specific social agendas and value systems 130 Notwithstanding economics legitimately has a role in informing government policy It is indeed in some ways an outgrowth of the older field of political economy Some academic economic journals have increased their efforts to gauge the consensus of economists regarding certain policy issues in hopes of effecting a more informed political environment Often there exists a low approval rate from professional economists regarding many public policies Policy issues featured in one survey of American Economic Association economists include trade restrictions social insurance for those put out of work by international competition genetically modified foods curbside recycling health insurance several questions medical malpractice barriers to entering the medical profession organ donations unhealthy foods mortgage deductions taxing internet sales WalMart casinos ethanol subsidies and inflation targeting 131 In Steady State Economics 1977 leading ecological economist and steadystate theorist Herman Daly argues that there exist logical inconsistencies between the emphasis placed on economic growth and the limited availability of natural resources 132 Issues like central bank independence central bank policies and rhetoric in central bank governors discourse or the premises of macroeconomic policies 133 monetary and fiscal policy of the state are focus of contention and criticism 134 Deirdre McCloskey has argued that many empirical economic studies are poorly reported and she and Stephen Ziliak argue that although her critique has been wellreceived practice has not improved 135 This latter contention is controversial 136 A 2002 International Monetary Fund study assessed the national economic growth predictions from Consensus Forecasts in the 1990s Of the 60 different national recessions that occurred only 2 3 were predicted a year in advance 137 Criticisms of assumptions Economics has been subject to criticism that it relies on unrealistic unverifiable or highly simplified assumptions in some cases because these assumptions simplify the proofs of desired conclusions Examples of such assumptions include perfect information profit maximization and rational choices 138 The field of information economics includes both mathematicaleconomical research and also behavioural economics akin to studies in behavioural psychology 139 Nevertheless prominent mainstream economists such as Keynes 140 and Joskow have observed that much of economics is conceptual rather than quantitative and difficult to model and formalize quantitatively In a discussion on oligopoly research Paul Joskow pointed out in 1975 that in practice serious students of actual economies tended to use informal models based upon qualitative factors specific to particular industries Joskow had a strong feeling that the important work in oligopoly was done through informal observations while formal models were trotted out ex post He argued that formal models were largely not important in the empirical work either and that the fundamental factor behind the theory of the firm behaviour was neglected 141 In recent years feminist critiques of neoclassical economic models gained prominence leading to the formation of feminist economics 142 Contrary to common conceptions of economics as a positive and objective science feminist economists call attention to the social construction of economics 143 and highlight the ways in which its models and methods reflect masculine preferences Primary criticisms focus on failures to account for the selfish nature of actors homo economicus exogenous tastes the impossibility of utility comparisons the exclusion of unpaid work and the exclusion of class and gender considerations Feminist economics developed to address these concerns and the field now includes critical examinations of many areas of economics including paid and unpaid work economic epistemology and history globalization household economics and the care economy In 1988 Marilyn Waring published the book If Women Counted in which she argues that the discipline of economics ignores womens unpaid work and the value of nature 144 according to Julie A Nelson If Women Counted showed exactly how the unpaid work traditionally done by women has been made invisible within national accounting systems and issued a wakeup call to issues of ecological sustainability 145 Bjørnholt and McKay argue that the financial crisis of 200708 and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession and call for a reshaping of both the economy economic theory and the economics profession They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet 146 Philip Mirowski observes that The imperatives of the orthodox research programme of economic science leave little room for maneuver and less room for originality These mandates Appropriate as many mathematical techniques and metaphorical expressions from contemporary respectable science primarily physics as possible Preserve to the maximum extent possible the attendant nineteenthcentury overtones of natural order Deny strenuously that neoclassical theory slavishly imitates physics Above all prevent all rival research programmes from encroaching by ridiculing all external attempts to appropriate twentieth century physics models All theorizing is in this way held hostage to nineteenthcentury concepts of energy 147 In a series of peerreviewed journal and conference papers and books published over a period of several decades John McMurtry has provided extensive criticism of what he terms the unexamined assumptions and implications of economics and their consequent cost to peoples lives 148 k Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Michael Perelman are two additional scholars who criticized conventional or mainstream economics Taleb opposes most economic theorizing which in his view suffers acutely from the problem of overuse of Platos Theory of Forms and calls for cancellation of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics saying that the damage from economic theories can be devastating 149 Michael Perelman provides extensive criticism of economics and its assumptions in all his books and especially his books published from 2000 to date papers and interviews Despite these concerns mainstream graduate programs have become increasingly technical and mathematical 150 Related subjects Main articles Law and economics Natural resource economics Philosophy and economics and Political economy Economics is one social science among several and has fields bordering on other areas including economic geography economic history public choice energy economics cultural economics family economics and institutional economics Law and economics or economic analysis of law is an approach to legal theory that applies methods of economics to law It includes the use of economic concepts to explain the effects of legal rules to assess which legal rules are economically efficient and to predict what the legal rules will be 151 A seminal article by Ronald Coase published in 1961 suggested that welldefined property rights could overcome the problems of externalities 152 Political economy is the interdisciplinary study that combines economics law and political science in explaining how political institutions the political environment and the economic system capitalist socialist mixed influence each other It studies questions such as how monopoly rentseeking behaviour and externalities should impact government policy 153 Historians have employed political economy to explore the ways in the past that persons and groups with common economic interests have used politics to effect changes beneficial to their interests 154 Energy economics is a broad scientific subject area which includes topics related to energy supply and energy demand GeorgescuRoegen reintroduced the concept of entropy in relation to economics and energy from thermodynamics as distinguished from what he viewed as the mechanistic foundation of neoclassical economics drawn from Newtonian physics His work contributed significantly to thermoeconomics and to ecological economics He also did foundational work which later developed into evolutionary economics 155 The sociological subfield of economic sociology arose primarily through the work of Émile Durkheim Max Weber and Georg Simmel as an approach to analysing the effects of economic phenomena in relation to the overarching social paradigm ie modernity 156 Classic works include Max Weber s The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism 1905 and Georg Simmel s The Philosophy of Money 1900 More recently the works of Mark Granovetter Peter Hedstrom and Richard Swedberg have been influential in this field Practice Main articles Economic methodology Mathematical economics and Schools of economics Contemporary economics uses mathematics Economists draw on the tools of calculus linear algebra statistics game theory and computer science 157 Professional economists are expected to be familiar with these tools while a minority specialize in econometrics and mathematical methods Empirical investigation Main articles Econometrics and Experimental economics Economic theories are frequently tested empirically largely through the use of econometrics using economic data 158 The controlled experiments common to the physical sciences are difficult and uncommon in economics 159 and instead broad data is observationally studied this type of testing is typically regarded as less rigorous than controlled experimentation and the conclusions typically more tentative However the field of experimental economics is growing and increasing use is being made of natural experiments Statistical methods such as regression analysis are common Practitioners use such methods to estimate the size economic significance and statistical significance signal strength of the hypothesized relations and to adjust for noise from other variables By such means a hypothesis may gain acceptance although in a probabilistic rather than certain sense Acceptance is dependent upon the falsifiable hypothesis surviving tests Use of commonly accepted methods need not produce a final conclusion or even a consensus on a particular question given different tests data sets and prior beliefs Criticisms based on professional standards and non replicability of results serve as further checks against bias errors and overgeneralization 160 161 although much economic research has been accused of being nonreplicable and prestigious journals have been accused of not facilitating replication through the provision of the code and data 162 Like theories uses of test statistics are themselves open to critical analysis 163 although critical commentary on papers in economics in prestigious journals such as the American Economic Review has declined precipitously in the past 40 years This has been attributed to journals incentives to maximize citations in order to rank higher on the Social Science Citation Index SSCI 164 In applied economics inputoutput models employing linear programming methods are quite common Large amounts of data are run through computer programs to analyse the impact of certain policies IMPLAN is one wellknown example Experimental economics has promoted the use of scientifically controlled experiments This has reduced the longnoted distinction of economics from natural sciences because it allows direct tests of what were previously taken as axioms 165 In some cases these have found that the axioms are not entirely correct for example the ultimatum game has revealed that people reject unequal offers In behavioural economics psychologist Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002 for his and Amos Tversky s empirical discovery of several cognitive biases and heuristics Similar empirical testing occurs in neuroeconomics Another example is the assumption of narrowly selfish preferences versus a model that tests for selfish altruistic and cooperative preferences 166 These techniques have led some to argue that economics is a genuine science 167 Profession Main article Economist The professionalization of economics reflected in the growth of graduate programmes on the subject has been described as the main change in economics since around 1900 168 Most major universities and many colleges have a major school or department in which academic degrees are awarded in the subject whether in the liberal arts business or for professional study In the private sector professional economists are employed as consultants and in industry including banking and finance Economists also work for various government departments and agencies for example the national treasury central bank or bureau of statistics There are dozens of prizes awarded to economists each year for outstanding intellectual contributions to the field the most prominent of which is the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences though it is not a Nobel Prize See also Business portal Business ethics Economics terminology that differs from common usage Economic ideology Economic policy Economic union Free trade List of multilateral free trade

economics articles Outline of economics Notes The term economics is derived from economic science and the word economic is perhaps shortened from economical or derived from the French word économique or directly from the Latin word oeconomicus of domestic economy This in turn comes from the Ancient Greek οἰκονομικός oikonomikos practiced in the management of a household or family and therefore frugal thrifty which in turn comes from οἰκονομία oikonomia household management which in turn comes from οἶκος oikos house and νόμος nomos custom or law 15 Capital in Smiths usage includes fixed capital and circulating capital The latter includes wages and labour maintenance money and inputs from land mines and fisheries associated with production 43 This science indicates the cases in which commerce is truly productive where whatever is gained by one is lost by another and where it is profitable to all it also teaches us to appreciate its several processes but simply in their results at which it stops Besides this knowledge the merchant must also understand the processes of his art He must be acquainted with the commodities in which he deals their qualities and defects the countries from which they are derived their markets the means of their transportation the values to be given for them in exchange and the method of keeping accounts The same remark is applicable to the agriculturist to the manufacturer and to the practical man of business to acquire a thorough knowledge of the causes and consequences of each phenomenon the study of political economy is essentially necessary to them all and to become expert in his particular pursuit each one must add thereto a knowledge of its processes Say 1803 pXVI And when we submit the definition in question to this test it
