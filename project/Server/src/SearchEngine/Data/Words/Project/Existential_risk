Global catastrophic risk Hypothetical future event that has the potential to damage human wellbeing on a global scale Artists impression of a major asteroid impact An asteroid with an impact strength of a billion atomic bombs may have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 1 A global catastrophic risk is a hypothetical future event which could damage human wellbeing on a global scale 2 even endangering or destroying modern civilization 3 An event that could cause human extinction or permanently and drastically curtail humanitys potential is known as an existential risk 4 Potential global catastrophic risks include anthropogenic risks caused by humans technology governance climate change and nonanthropogenic or external risks 3 Examples of technology risks are hostile artificial intelligence and destructive biotechnology or nanotechnology Insufficient or malign global governance creates risks in the social and political domain such as a global war including nuclear holocaust bioterrorism using genetically modified organisms cyberterrorism destroying critical infrastructure like the electrical grid or the failure to manage a natural pandemic Problems and risks in the domain of earth system governance include global warming environmental degradation including extinction of species famine as a result of nonequitable resource distribution human overpopulation crop failures and non sustainable agriculture Examples of nonanthropogenic risks are an asteroid impact event a supervolcanic eruption a lethal gammaray burst a geomagnetic storm destroying electronic equipment natural longterm climate change hostile extraterrestrial life or the predictable Sun transforming into a red giant star engulfing the Earth Contents 1 Classifications 11 Global catastrophic

Prevention as Global Priority 5 Global catastrophic vs existential edit A global catastrophic risk is any risk that is at least global in scope and is not subjectively imperceptible in intensity Those that are at least transgenerational affecting all future generations in scope and terminal clarification needed in intensity are classified as existential risks While a global catastrophic risk may kill the vast majority of life on earth humanity could still potentially recover An existential risk on the other hand is one that either destroys humanity and presumably all but the most rudimentary species of nonhuman lifeforms andor plant life entirely or at least prevents any chance of civilization recovering 6 Similarly in Catastrophe Risk and Response Richard Posner singles out and groups together events that bring about utter overthrow or ruin on a global rather than a local or regional scale Posner singles out such events as worthy of special attention on costbenefit grounds because they could directly or indirectly jeopardize the survival of the human race as a whole 7 Posners events include meteor impacts runaway global warming grey goo bioterrorism and particle accelerator accidents Researchers experience difficulty in studying near human extinction directly since humanity has never been destroyed before 8 While this does not mean that it will not be in the future it does make modelling existential risks difficult due in part to survivorship bias However civilizations vanished rather frequently in human history Likelihood edit Some risks are due to phenomena that have occurred in Earths past and left a geological record Together with contemporary observations it is possible to make informed estimates of the likelihood such events will occur in the future For example an extinctionlevel comet or asteroid impact event before the year 2100 has been estimated at oneinamillion 9 10 further explanation needed Supervolcanoes are another example There are several known supervolcanos including Mt Toba which some say almost wiped out humanity at the time of its last eruption The geologic record suggests this particular supervolcano reerupts about every 50000 years 11 12 further explanation needed Without the benefit of geological records and direct observation the relative danger posed by other threats is much more difficult to calculate In addition it is one thing to estimate the likelihood of an event taking place but quite another to assess how likely an event will cause extinction if it does occur and most difficult of all the risk posted by synergistic effects of multiple events taking place simultaneously citation needed The two tiedforlowest points for the Doomsday Clock have been in 1953 when the Clock was set to two minutes until midnight after the US and the Soviet Union began testing hydrogen bombs and in 2018 following the failure of world leaders to address tensions relating to nuclear weapons and climate change issues 13 Given the limitations of ordinary calculation and modeling expert elicitation is frequently used instead to obtain probability estimates 14 In 2008 an informal survey of experts on different global catastrophic risks at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at the University of Oxford suggested a 19 chance of human extinction by the year 2100 The conference report cautions that the results should be taken with a grain of salt the results were not meant to capture all large risks and did not include things like climate change and the results likely reflect many cognitive biases of the conference participants 15 Risk Estimated probability for human extinction before 2100 Overall probability 19 Molecular nanotechnology weapons 5 Superintelligent AI 5 All wars including civil wars 4 Engineered pandemic 2 Nuclear war 1 Nanotechnology accident 05 Natural pandemic 005 Nuclear terrorism 003 Table source Future of Humanity Institute 2008 16 The 2016 annual report by the Global Challenges Foundation estimates that an average American is more than five times more likely to die during a humanextinction event than in a car crash 17 18 There are significant methodological challenges in estimating these risks with precision Most attention has been given to risks to human civilization over the next 100 years but forecasting for this length of time is difficult The types of threats posed by nature have been argued to be relatively constant though this has been disputed 19 and new risks could be discovered Anthropogenic threats however are likely to change dramatically with the development of new technology while volcanoes have been a threat throughout history nuclear weapons have only been an issue since the 20th century Historically the ability of experts to predict the future over these timescales has proved very limited Manmade threats such as nuclear war or nanotechnology are harder to predict than natural threats due to the inherent methodological difficulties in the social sciences In general it is hard to estimate the magnitude of the risk from this or other dangers especially as both international relations and technology can change rapidly Existential risks pose unique challenges to prediction even more than other longterm events because of observation selection effects Unlike with most events the failure of a complete extinction event to occur in the past is not evidence against their likelihood in the future because every world that has experienced such an extinction event has no observers so regardless of their frequency no civilization observes existential risks in its history 8 These anthropic issues can be avoided by looking at evidence that does not have such selection effects such as asteroid impact craters on the Moon or directly evaluating the likely impact of new technology 5 In addition to known and tangible risks unforeseeable black swan extinction events may occur presenting an additional methodological problem 20 Moral importance of existential risk edit Some scholars have strongly favored reducing existential risk on the grounds that it greatly benefits future generations Derek Parfit argues that extinction would be a great loss because our descendants could potentially survive for four billion years before the expansion of the Sun makes the Earth uninhabitable 21 22 Nick Bostrom argues that there is even greater potential in colonizing space If future humans colonize space they may be able to support a very large number of people on other planets potentially lasting for trillions of years 6 Therefore reducing existential risk by even a small amount would have a very significant impact on the expected number of people who will exist in the future Exponential discounting might make these future benefits much less significant However Jason Matheny has argued that such discounting is inappropriate when assessing the value of existential risk reduction 9 Some economists have discussed the importance of global catastrophic risks though not existential risks Martin Weitzman argues that most of the expected economic damage from climate change may come from the small chance that warming greatly exceeds the midrange expectations resulting in catastrophic damage 23 Richard Posner has argued that we are doing far too little in general about small hardtoestimate risks of largescale catastrophes 24 Numerous cognitive biases can influence peoples judgment of the importance of existential risks including scope insensitivity hyperbolic discounting availability heuristic the conjunction fallacy the affect heuristic and the overconfidence effect 25 Scope insensitivity influences how bad people consider the extinction of the human race to be For example when people are motivated to donate money to altruistic causes the quantity they are willing to give does not increase linearly with the magnitude of the issue people are roughly as concerned about 200000 birds getting stuck in oil as they are about 2000 26 Similarly people are often more concerned about threats to individuals than to larger groups 25 There are economic reasons that can explain why so little effort is going into existential risk reduction It is a global good so even if a large nation decreases it that nation will only enjoy a small fraction of the benefit of doing so Furthermore the vast majority of the benefits may be enjoyed by far future generations and though these quadrillions of future people would in theory perhaps be willing to pay massive sums for existential risk reduction no mechanism for such a transaction exists 5 Potential sources of risk edit Some sources of catastrophic risk are natural such as meteor impacts or supervolcanoes Some of these have caused mass extinctions in the past On the other hand some risks are manmade such as global warming 27 environmental degradation engineered pandemics and nuclear war 28 Anthropogenic edit The Cambridge Project at Cambridge University states that the greatest threats to the human species are manmade they are artificial intelligence global warming nuclear war and rogue biotechnology 29 The Future of Humanity Institute also states that human extinction is more likely to result from anthropogenic causes than natural causes 5 30 Artificial intelligence edit Main articles Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence AI takeover Friendly artificial intelligence and Technological singularity It has been suggested that learning computers that rapidly become superintelligent may take unforeseen actions or that robots would outcompete humanity one technological singularity scenario 31 Because of its exceptional scheduling and organizational capability and the range of novel technologies it could develop it is possible that the first Earth superintelligence to emerge could rapidly become matchless and unrivaled conceivably it would be able to bring about almost any possible outcome and be able to foil virtually any attempt that threatened to prevent it achieving its objectives 32 It could eliminate wiping out if it chose any other challenging rival intellects alternatively it might manipulate or persuade them to change their behavior towards its own interests or it may merely obstruct their attempts at interference 32 In Bostroms book Superintelligence Paths Dangers Strategies he defines this as the control problem 33 Physicist Stephen Hawking Microsoft founder Bill Gates and SpaceX founder Elon Musk have echoed these concerns with Hawking theorizing that this AI could spell the end of the human race 34 In 2009 the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence AAAI hosted a conference to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any sort of autonomy and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard They noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semiautonomy including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved cockroach intelligence They noted that selfawareness as depicted in sciencefiction is probably unlikely but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls 35 Various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy and which pose some inherent concerns 36 37 A survey of AI experts estimated that the chance of humanlevel machine learning having an extremely bad eg human extinction longterm effect on humanity is 5 38 A 2008 survey by the Future of Humanity Institute estimated a 5 probability of extinction by superintelligence by 2100 15 Eliezer Yudkowsky believes that risks from artificial intelligence are harder to predict than any other known risks due to bias from anthropomorphism Since people base their judgments of artificial intelligence on their own experience he claims that they underestimate the potential power of AI 39 Biotechnology edit Main article Biotechnology risk Biotechnology can pose a global catastrophic risk in the form of bioengineered organisms viruses bacteria fungi plants or animals In many cases the organism will be a pathogen of humans livestock crops or other organisms we depend upon eg pollinators or gut bacteria However any organism able to catastrophically disrupt ecosystem functions eg highly competitive weeds outcompeting essential crops poses a biotechnology risk A biotechnology catastrophe may be caused by accidentally releasing a genetically engineered organism from controlled environments by the planned release of such an organism which then turns out to have unforeseen and catastrophic interactions with essential natural or agroecosystems or by intentional usage of biological agents in biological warfare or bioterrorism attacks 40 Pathogens may be intentionally or unintentionally genetically modified to change virulence and other characteristics 40 For example a group of Australian researchers unintentionally changed characteristics of the mousepox virus while trying to develop a virus to sterilize rodents 40 The modified virus became highly lethal even in vaccinated and naturally resistant mice 41 42 The technological means to genetically modify virus characteristics are likely to become more widely available in the future if not properly regulated 40 Terrorist applications of biotechnology have historically been infrequent To what extent this is due to a lack of capabilities or motivation is not resolved 40 However given current development more risk from novel engineered pathogens is to be expected in the future 40 Exponential growth has been observed in the biotechnology sector and Noun and Chyba predict that this will lead to major increases in biotechnological capabilities in the coming decades 40 They argue that risks from biological warfare and bioterrorism are distinct from nuclear and chemical threats because biological pathogens are easier to massproduce and their production is hard to control especially as the technological capabilities are becoming available even to individual users 40 In 2008 a survey by the Future of Humanity Institute estimated a 2 probability of extinction from engineered pandemics by 2100 15 Noun and Chyba propose three categories of measures to reduce risks from biotechnology and natural pandemics Regulation or prevention of potentially dangerous research improved recognition of outbreaks and developing facilities to mitigate disease outbreaks eg better andor more widely distributed vaccines 40 Cyberattack edit Main article Cyberattack Cyberattacks have the potential to destroy everything from personal data to electric grids Christine Peterson cofounder and past president of the Foresight Institute believes a cyberattack on electric grids has the potential to be a catastrophic risk 43 Environmental disaster edit Main article Environmental disaster An environmental or ecological disaster such as world crop failure and collapse of ecosystem services could be induced by the present trends of overpopulation economic development and non sustainable agriculture Most environmental scenarios involve one or more of the following Holocene extinction event 44 scarcity of water that could lead to approximately one half of the Earths population being without safe drinking water pollinator decline overfishing massive deforestation desertification climate change or massive water pollution episodes Detected in the early 21st century a threat in this direction is colony collapse disorder 45 a phenomenon that might foreshadow the imminent extinction 46 of the Western honeybee As the bee plays a vital role in pollination its extinction would severely disrupt the food chain An October 2017 report published in The Lancet stated that toxic air water soils and workplaces were collectively responsible for 9 million deaths worldwide in 2015 particularly from air pollution which was linked to deaths by increasing susceptibility to noninfectious diseases such as heart disease stroke and lung cancer 47 The report warned that the pollution crisis was exceeding the envelope on the amount of pollution the Earth can carry and threatens the continuing survival of human societies 47 Experimental technology accident edit Further information Grey goo and Bioterrorism Nick Bostrom suggested that in the pursuit of knowledge humanity might inadvertently create a device that could destroy Earth and the Solar System 48 Investigations in nuclear and highenergy physics could create unusual conditions with catastrophic consequences For example scientists worried that the first nuclear test might ignite the atmosphere 49 50 Others worried that the RHIC 51 or the Large Hadron Collider might start a chainreaction global disaster involving black holes strangelets or false vacuum states These particular concerns have been refuted 52 53 54 55 but the general concern remains Biotechnology could lead to the creation of a pandemic chemical warfare could be taken to an extreme nanotechnology could lead to grey goo in which outofcontrol selfreplicating robots consume all living matter on earth while building more of themselvesin both cases either deliberately or by accident 56 Global warming edit Main articles Climate apocalypse Runaway climate change and Climate security Global warming refers to the warming caused by human technology since the 19th century or earlier Projections of future climate change suggest further global warming sea level rise and an increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events and weatherrelated disasters Effects of global warming include loss of biodiversity stresses to existing foodproducing systems increased spread of known infectious diseases such as malaria and rapid mutation of microorganisms In November 2017 a statement by 15364 scientists from 184 countries indicated that increasing levels of greenhouse gases from use of fossil fuels human population growth deforestation and overuse of land for agricultural production particularly by farming ruminants for meat consumption are trending in ways that forecast an increase in human misery over coming decades 3 Mineral resource exhaustion edit Romanian American economist Nicholas GeorgescuRoegen a progenitor in economics and the paradigm founder of ecological economics has argued that the carrying capacity of Earth that is Earths capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earths finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use and consequently that the world economy as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse leading to the demise of human civilization itself 57 303f Ecological economist and steadystate theorist Herman Daly a student of GeorgescuRoegen has propounded the same argument by asserting that all we can do is to avoid wasting the limited capacity of creation to support present and future life on Earth 58 370 Ever since GeorgescuRoegen and Daly published these views various scholars in the field have been discussing the existential impossibility of allocating earths finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us as there is no way or only little way of knowing in advance if or when mankind will ultimately face extinction In effect any conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point 59 253256 60 165 61 168171 62 150153 63 106109 64 546549 65 142145 66 Nanotechnology edit See also Grey goo and Potential risks of nanotechnology Many nanoscale technologies are in development or currently in use 67 The only one that appears to pose a significant global catastrophic risk is molecular manufacturing a technique that would make it possible to build complex structures at atomic precision 68 Molecular manufacturing requires significant advances in nanotechnology but once achieved could produce highly advanced products at low costs and in large quantities in nanofactories of desktop proportions 67 68 When nanofactories gain the ability to produce other nanofactories production may only be limited by relatively abundant factors such as input materials energy and software 67 Molecular manufacturing could be used to cheaply produce among many other products highly advanced durable weapons 67 Being equipped with compact computers and motors these could be increasingly autonomous and have a large range of capabilities 67 Chris Phoenix and Treder classify catastrophic risks posed by nanotechnology into three categories From augmenting the development of other technologies such as AI and biotechnology By enabling massproduction of potentially dangerous products that cause risk dynamics such as arms races depending on how they are used From uncontrolled selfperpetuating processes with destructive effects Several researchers state that the bulk of risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war arms races and destructive global government 41 67 69 Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races compared to eg nuclear arms races A large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low 67 The ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing will be cheap and easy to hide 67 Therefore lack of insight into the other parties capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes 67 70 Molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade 67 a potential peacepromoting factor Wars of aggression may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield 67 Since selfregulation by all state and nonstate actors seems hard to achieve 71 measures to mitigate warrelated risks have mainly been proposed in the area of international cooperation 67 72 International infrastructure may be expanded giving more sovereignty to the international level This could help coordinate efforts for arms control International institutions dedicated specifically to nanotechnology perhaps analogously to the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA or general arms control may also be designed 72 One may also jointly make differential technological progress on defensive technologies a policy that players should usually favour 67 The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology also suggests some technical restrictions 73 Improved transparency regarding technological capabilities may be another important facilitator for armscontrol Grey goo is another catastrophic scenario which was proposed by Eric Drexler in his 1986 book Engines of Creation 74 and has been a theme in mainstream media and fiction 75 76 This scenario involves tiny selfreplicating robots that consume the entire biosphere using it as a source of energy and building blocks Nowadays however nanotech expertsincluding Drexlerdiscredit the scenario According to Phoenix a socalled grey goo could only be the product of a deliberate and difficult engineering process not an accident 77 Warfare and mass destruction edit Further information Nuclear holocaust World War III and Cold War II Joseph Pennell s 1918 Liberty bond poster calls up the pictorial image of an invaded burning New York City The scenarios that have been explored most frequently are nuclear warfare and doomsday devices Mistakenly launching a nuclear attack in response to a false alarm is one possible scenario this nearly happened during the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident Although the probability of a nuclear war per year is slim Professor Martin Hellman has described it as inevitable in the long run unless the probability approaches zero inevitably there will come a day when civilizations luck runs out 78 During the Cuban missile crisis US president John F Kennedy estimated the odds of nuclear war at somewhere between one out of three and even 79 The United States and Russia have a combined arsenal of 14700 nuclear weapons 80 and there is an estimated total of 15700 nuclear weapons in existence worldwide 80 Beyond nuclear other military threats to humanity include biological warfare BW By contrast chemical warfare while able to create multiple local catastrophes is unlikely to create a global one Nuclear war could yield unprecedented human death tolls and habitat destruction Detonating large numbers of nuclear weapons would have an immediate short term and longterm effects on the climate causing cold weather and reduced sunlight and photosynthesis 81 that may generate significant upheaval in advanced civilizations 82 However while popular perception sometimes takes nuclear war as the end of the world experts assign low probability to human extinction from nuclear war 83 84 In 1982 Brian Martin estimated that a USSoviet nuclear exchange might kill 400450 million directly mostly in the United States Europe and Russia and maybe several hundred million more through followup consequences in those same areas 83 In 2008 a survey by the Future of Humanity Institute estimated a 4 probability of extinction from warfare by 2100 with a 1 chance of extinction from nuclear warfare 15 World population and agricultural crisis edit Main articles Malthusian catastrophe and Human overpopulation M King Hubbert s prediction of world petroleum production rates Modern agriculture is heavily dependent on petroleum energy The 20th century saw a rapid increase in human population due to medical developments and massive increases in agricultural productivity 85 such as the Green Revolution 86 Between 1950 and 1984 as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe world grain production increased by 250 The Green Revolution in agriculture helped food production to keep pace with worldwide population growth or actually enabled population growth The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers natural gas pesticides oil and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation 87 David Pimentel professor of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University and Mario Giampietro senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition INRAN place in their 1994 study Food Land Population and the US Economy the maximum US population for a sustainable economy at 200 million To achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster the United States must reduce its population by at least onethird and world population will have to be reduced by twothirds says the study 88 The authors of this study believe that the mentioned agricultural crisis will begin to have an effect on the world after 2020 and will become critical after 2050 Geologist Dale Allen Pfeiffer claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such as never experienced before 89 90 Since supplies of petroleum and natural gas are essential to modern agriculture techniques a fall in global oil supplies see peak oil for global concerns could cause spiking food prices and unprecedented famine in the coming decades 91 92 Wheat is humanitys thirdmostproduced cereal Extant fungal infections such as Ug99 93 a kind of stem rust can cause 100 crop losses in most modern varieties Little or no treatment is possible and infection spreads on the wind Should the worlds large grainproducing areas become infected the ensuing crisis in wheat availability would lead to price spikes and shortages in other food products 94 Nonanthropogenic edit Asteroid impact edit Main articles Asteroidimpact avoidance and Impact event Several asteroids have collided with earth in recent geological history The Chicxulub asteroid for example was around 6 miles in diameter and is theorized to have caused the extinction of the nonavian dinosaurs 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous No sufficiently large asteroid currently exists in an Earthcrossing orbit however a comet of sufficient size to cause human extinction could impact the Earth though the annual probability may be less than 10 8 95 Geoscientist Brian Toon estimates that while a few people such as some fishermen in Costa Rica could plausibly survive a 6mile meteorite a 60mile meteorite would be large enough to incinerate everybody 96 Asteroids with around a 1km diameter have impacted the Earth on average once every 500000 years these are probably too small to pose an extinction risk but might kill billions of people 95 97 Larger asteroids are less common Small nearEarth asteroids are regularly observed and can impact anywhere on the Earth injuring local populations 98 As of 2013 Spaceguard estimates it has identified 95 of all NEOs over 1km in size 99 In April 2018 the B612 Foundation reported Its a 100 per cent certain well be hit by a devastating asteroid but were not 100 per cent sure when 100 101 Also in 2018 physicist Stephen Hawking in his final book Brief Answers to the Big Questions considered an asteroid collision to be the biggest threat to the planet 102 103 104 In June 2018 the US National Science and Technology Council warned that America is unprepared for an asteroid impact event and has developed and released the National NearEarth Object Preparedness Strategy Action Plan to better prepare 105 106 107 108 109 According to expert testimony in the United States Congress in 2013 NASA would require at least five years of preparation before a mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched 110 Cosmic threats edit A number of astronomical threats have been identified Massive objects eg a star large planet or black hole could be catastrophic if a close encounter occurred in the Solar System In April 2008 it was announced that two simulations of longterm planetary movement one at the Paris Observatory and the other at the University of California Santa Cruz indicate a 1 chance that Mercury s orbit could be made unstable by Jupiters gravitational pull sometime during the lifespan of the Sun Were this to happen the simulations suggest a collision with Earth could be one of four possible outcomes the others being Mercury colliding with the Sun colliding with Venus or being ejected from the Solar System altogether If Mercury were to collide with Earth all life on Earth could be obliterated entirely an asteroid 15km wide is believed to have caused the extinction of the nonavian dinosaurs whereas Mercury is 4879km in diameter 111 Conjectured illustration of the scorched Earth after the Sun has entered the red giant phase about 7 billion years from now 112 If our universe lies within a false vacuum a bubble of lowerenergy vacuum could come to exist by chance or otherwise in our universe and catalyze the conversion of our universe to a lower energy state in a volume expanding at nearly the speed of light destroying all that we know without forewarning Such an occurrence is called vacuum decay 113 114 Another cosmic threat is a gammaray burst typically produced by a supernova when a star collapses inward on itself and then bounces outward in a massive explosion Under certain circumstances these events are thought to produce massive bursts of gamma radiation emanating outward from the axis of rotation of the star If such an event were to occur oriented towards the Earth the massive amounts of gamma radiation could significantly affect the Earths atmosphere and pose an existential threat to all life Such a gammaray burst may have been the cause of the OrdovicianSilurian extinction events Neither this scenario nor the destabilization of Mercurys orbit are likely in the foreseeable future 115 A powerful solar flare or solar superstorm which is a drastic and unusual decrease or increase in the Suns power output could have severe consequences for life on Earth 116 117 The most predictable outcome for the future of the Earth is the Suns expansion into a red giant star The Sun will be about 12 billion years old and expand to swallow both Mercury and Venus reaching a maximum radius of 12 AU 180000000 km The Earth will interact tidally with the Suns outer atmosphere which would directly serve to decrease Earths orbital radius Drag from the chromosphere of the Sun would also reduce the Earths orbit These effects will act to counterbalance the effect of mass loss by the Sun and the Earth will probably be engulfed by the Sun 118 Extraterrestrial invasion edit Main article Alien invasion Intelligent extraterrestrial life if existent could invade Earth 119 either to exterminate and supplant human life enslave it under a colonial system steal the planets resources or destroy the planet altogether Although evidence of alien life has never been proven scientists such as Carl Sagan have postulated that the existence of extraterrestrial life is very likely In 1969 the ExtraTerrestrial Exposure Law was added to the United States Code of Federal Regulations Title 14 Section 1211 in response to the possibility of biological contamination resulting from the US Apollo Space Program It was removed in 1991 120 Scientists consider such a scenario technically possible but unlikely 121 An article in The New York Times discussed the possible threats for humanity of intentionally sending messages aimed at extraterrestrial life into the cosmos in the context of the SETI efforts Several renowned public figures such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have argued against sending such messages on the grounds that extraterrestrial civilizations with technology are probably far more advanced than humanity and could pose an existential threat to humanity 122 Global pandemic edit Main article Pandemic Numerous historical examples of pandemics 123 had a devastating effect on a large number of people The present unprecedented scale and speed of human movement make it more difficult than ever to contain an epidemic through local quarantines and other sources of uncertainty and the evolving nature of the risk means natural pandemics may pose a realistic threat to human civilization 19 There are several classes of argument about the likelihood of pandemics One class of argument about likelihood stems from the history of pandemics where the limited size of historical pandemics is evidence that larger pandemics are unlikely This argument has been disputed on several grounds including the changing risk due to changing population and behavioral patterns among humans the limited historical record and the existence of an anthropic bias 19 Another argument about the likelihood of pandemics is based on an evolutionary model that predicts that naturally evolving pathogens will ultimately develop an upper limit to their virulence 124 This is because pathogens with high enough virulence quickly kill their hosts and reduce their chances of spread the infection to new hosts or carriers 125 This model has limits however because the fitness advantage of limited virulence is primarily a function of a limited number of hosts Any pathogen with a high virulence high transmission rate and long incubation time may have already caused a catastrophic pandemic before ultimately virulence is limited through natural selection Additionally a pathogen that infects humans as a secondary host and primarily infects another species a zoonosis has no constraints on its virulence in people since the accidental secondary infections do not affect its evolution 126 Lastly in models where virulence level and rate of transmission are related high levels of virulence can evolve 127 Virulence is instead limited by the existence of complex populations of hosts with different susceptibilities to infection or by some hosts being geographically isolated 124 The size of the host population and competition between different strains of pathogens can also alter virulence 128 Neither of these arguments is applicable to bioengineered pathogens and this poses entirely different risks of pandemics Experts have concluded that Developments in science and technology could significantly ease the development and use of high consequence biological weapons and these highly virulent and highly transmissible bioengineered pathogens represent new potential pandemic threats 129 Natural climate change edit Climate change refers to a lasting change in the Earths climate The climate has ranged from ice ages to warmer periods when palm trees grew in Antarctica It has been hypothesized that there was also a period called snowball Earth when all the oceans were covered in a layer of ice These global climatic changes occurred slowly prior to the rise of human civilization about 10 thousand years ago near the end of the last Major Ice Age when the climate became more stable However abrupt climate change on the decade time scale has occurred regionally Since civilization originated during a period of stable climate a natural variation into a new climate regime colder or hotter could pose a threat to civilization 130 131 In the history of the Earth many ice ages are known to have occurred An ice age would have a serious impact on civilization because vast areas of land mainly in North America Europe and Asia could become uninhabitable Currently the world is in an interglacial period within a much older glacial event The last glacial expansion ended about 10000 years ago and all civilizations evolved later than this Scientists do not predict that a natural ice age will occur anytime soon citation needed The amount of heat trapping gases emitted into Earths Oceans and atmosphere will prevent the next ice age which otherwise would begin in around 50000 years and likely more glacial cycles 132 133 Volcanism edit Main article Supervolcano Yellowstone sits on top of three overlapping calderas A geological event such as massive flood basalt volcanism or the eruption of a supervolcano 134 could lead to a socalled volcanic winter similar to a nuclear winter One such event the Toba eruption 135 occurred in Indonesia about 71500 years ago According to the Toba catastrophe theory 136 the event may have reduced human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals Yellowstone Caldera is another such supervolcano having undergone 142 or more caldera forming eruptions in the past 17 million years 137 A massive volcano eruption would eject extraordinary volumes of volcanic dust toxic and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere with serious effects on global climate towards extreme global cooling volcanic winter if shortterm and ice age if longterm or global warming if greenhouse gases were to prevail When the supervolcano at Yellowstone last erupted 640000 years ago the thinnest layers of the ash ejected from the caldera spread over most of the United States west of the Mississippi River and part of northeastern Mexico The magma covered much of what is now Yellowstone National Park and extended beyond covering much of the ground from Yellowstone River in the east to the Idaho falls in the west with some of the flows extending north beyond Mammoth Springs 138 According to a recent study if the Yellowstone caldera erupted again as a supervolcano an ash layer one to three millimeters thick could be deposited as far away as New York enough to reduce traction on roads and runways short out electrical transformers and cause respiratory problems There would be centimeters of thickness over much of the US Midwest enough to disrupt crops and livestock especially if it happened at a critical time in the growing season The worstaffected city would likely be Billings Montana population 109000 which the model predicted would be covered with ash estimated as 103 to 18 meters thick 139 The main longterm effect is through global climate change which reduces the temperature globally by about 515 degrees C for a decade together with the direct effects of the deposits of ash on their crops A large supervolcano like Toba would deposit one or two meters thickness of ash over an area of several million square kilometers1000 cubic kilometers is equivalent to a onemeter thickness of ash spread over a million square kilometers If that happened in some densely populated agricultural area such as India it could destroy one or two seasons of crops for two billion people 140 However Yellowstone shows no signs of a supereruption at present and it is not certain that a future supereruption will occur there 141 142 Research published in 2011 finds evidence that massive volcanic eruptions caused massive coal combustion supporting models for significant generation of greenhouse gases Researchers have suggested that massive volcanic eruptions through coal beds in Siberia would generate significant greenhouse gases and cause a runaway greenhouse effect 143 Massive eruptions can also throw enough pyroclastic debris and other material into the atmosphere to partially block out the sun and cause a volcanic winter as happened on a smaller scale in 1816 following the eruption of Mount Tambora the socalled Year Without a Summer Such an eruption might cause the immediate deaths of millions of people several hundred miles from the eruption and perhaps billions of death worldwide due to the failure of the monsoons 144 resulting in major crop failures causing starvation on a profound scale 144 A much more speculative concept is the verneshot a hypothetical volcanic eruption caused by the buildup of gas deep underneath a craton Such an event may be forceful enough to launch an extreme amount of material from the crust and mantle into a suborbital trajectory Proposed mitigation edit Planetary management and respecting planetary boundaries have been proposed as approaches to preventing ecological catastrophes Within the scope of these approaches the field of geoengineering encompasses the deliberate largescale engineering and manipulation of the planetary environment to combat or counteract anthropogenic changes in atmospheric chemistry Space colonization is a proposed alternative to improve the odds of surviving an extinction scenario 145 Solutions of this scope may require megascale engineering Food storage has been proposed globally but the monetary cost would be high Furthermore it would likely contribute to the current millions of deaths per year due to malnutrition 146 Some survivalists stock survival retreats with multipleyear food supplies The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is buried 400 feet 120m inside a mountain on an island in the Arctic It is designed to hold 25 billion seeds from more than 100 countries as a precaution to preserve the worlds crops The surrounding rock is 6C 21F as of 2015 but the vault is kept at 18C 0F by refrigerators powered by locally sourced coal 147 148 More speculatively if society continues to function and if the biosphere remains habitable calorie needs for the present human population might in theory be met during an extended absence of sunlight given sufficient advance planning Conjectured solutions include growing mushrooms on the dead plant biomass left in the wake of the catastrophe converting cellulose to sugar or feeding natural gas to methanedigesting bacteria 149 150 Global catastrophic risks and global governance edit Insufficient global governance creates risks in the social and political domain but the governance mechanisms develop more slowly than technological and social change There are concerns from governments the private sector as well as the general public about the lack of governance mechanisms to efficiently deal with risks negotiate and adjudicate between diverse and conflicting interests This is further underlined by an understanding of the interconnectedness of global systemic risks 151 In absence or anticipation of global governance national governments can act individually to better understand mitigate and prepare for global catastrophes 152 Climate emergency plans edit In 2018 the Club of Rome submitted a plan to the European Parliament urging to address the existential threat from climate change more forcefully calling for a collaborative climate action afford 153 Organizations edit The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists est 1945 is one of the oldest global risk organizations founded after the public became alarmed by the potential of atomic warfare in the aftermath of WWII It studies risks associated with nuclear war and energy and famously maintains the Doomsday Clock established in 1947 The Foresight Institute est 1986 examines the risks of nanotechnology and its benefits It was one of the earliest organizations to study the unintended consequences of otherwise harmless technology gone haywire at a global scale It was founded by K Eric Drexler who postulated grey goo 154 155 Beginning after 2000 a growing number of scientists philosophers and tech billionaires created organizations devoted to studying global risks both inside and outside of academia 156 Independent nongovernmental organizations NGOs include the Machine Intelligence Research Institute est 2000 which aims to reduce the risk of a catastrophe caused by artificial intelligence 157 with donors including Peter Thiel and Jed McCaleb 158 The Nuclear Threat Initiative est 2001 seeks to reduce global threats from nuclear biological and chemical threats and containment of damage after an event 159 It maintains a nuclear material security index 160 The Lifeboat Foundation est 2009 funds research into preventing a technological catastrophe 161 Most of the research money funds projects at universities 162 The Global Catastrophic Risk Institute est 2011 is a think tank for catastrophic risk It is funded by the NGO Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs The Global Challenges Foundation est 2012 based in Stockholm and founded by Laszlo Szombatfalvy releases a yearly report on the state of global risks 17 18 The Future of Life Institute est 2014 aims to support research and initiatives for safeguarding life considering new technologies and challenges facing humanity 163 Elon Musk is one of its biggest donors 164 Universitybased organizations include the Future of Humanity Institute est 2005 which researches the questions of humanitys longterm future particularly existential risk It was founded by Nick Bostrom and is based at Oxford University The Centre for the Study of Existential Risk est 2012 is a Cambridgebased organization which studies four major technological risks artificial intelligence biotechnology global warming and warfare All are manmade risks as Huw Price explained to the AFP news agency It seems a reasonable prediction that some time in this or the next century intelligence will escape from the constraints of biology He added that when this happens were no longer the smartest things around and will risk being at the mercy of machines that are not malicious but machines whose interests dont include us 165 Stephen Hawking was an acting adviser The Millennium Alliance for Humanity and the Biosphere is a Stanford Universitybased organization focusing on many issues related to global catastrophe by bringing together members of academic in the humanities 166 167 It was founded by Paul Ehrlich among others 168 Stanford University also has the Center for International Security and Cooperation focusing on political cooperation to reduce global catastrophic risk 169 The Center for Security and Emerging Technology was established in January 2019 at Georgetowns Walsh School of Foreign Service and will focus on policy research of emerging technologies with an initial emphasis on artificial intelligence 170 They received a grant of 55M USD from Good Ventures as suggested by the Open Philanthropy Project 170 Other risk assessment groups are based in or are part of governmental organizations The World Health Organization WHO includes a division called the Global Alert and Response GAR which monitors and responds to global epidemic crisis 171 GAR helps member states with training and coordination of response to epidemics 172 The United States Agency for International Development USAID has its Emerging Pandemic Threats Program which aims to prevent and contain naturally generated pandemics at their source 173 The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has a division called the Global Security Principal Directorate which researches on behalf of the government issues such as biosecurity and counterterrorism 174 See also edit Apocalyptic and postapocalyptic
