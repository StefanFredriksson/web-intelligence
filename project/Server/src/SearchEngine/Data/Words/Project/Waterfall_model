Glossaries Artificial intelligence Computer science Electrical and electronics engineering v t e The unmodified waterfall model Progress flows from the top to the bottom like a cascading waterfall The waterfall model is a breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialisation of tasks The approach is typical for certain areas of engineering design In software development it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches as progress flows in largely one direction downwards like a waterfall through the phases of conception initiation analysis design construction testing deployment and maintenance The waterfall development model originated in the manufacturing and construction industries where the highly structured physical environments meant that design changes became prohibitively expensive much sooner in the development process When first adopted for software development there were no recognised alternatives for knowledgebased creative work 1 Contents 1 History 2 Model 3 Supporting arguments 4 Criticism 5 Modified waterfall models 6 Royces final model 7 See also 8 References 9 External links History edit The first known presentation describing use of such phases in software engineering was held by Herbert D Benington at the Symposium on Advanced Programming Methods for Digital Computers on 29 June 1956 2 This presentation was about the development of software for SAGE In 1983 the paper was republished with a foreword by Benington explaining that the phases were on purpose organised according to the specialisation of tasks and pointing out that the process was not in fact performed in a strict topdown fashion but depended on a prototype 1 The first formal description of the waterfall model is often cited as a 1970 article by Winston W Royce 3 4 although Royce did not use the term waterfall in that article Royce presented this model as an example of a flawed nonworking model which is how the term is generally used in writing about software developmentto describe a critical view of a commonly used software development practice 5 The earliest use of the term waterfall may have been in a 1976 paper by Bell and Thayer 6 In 1985 the United States Department of Defense captured this approach in DODSTD2167A their standards for working with software development contractors which stated that the contractor shall implement a software development cycle that includes the following six phases Preliminary Design Detailed Design Coding and Unit Testing Integration and Testing 7 Model edit In Royces original waterfall model the following phases are followed in order System and software requirements captured in a product requirements document Analysis resulting in models schema and business rules Design resulting in the software architecture Coding the development proving and integration of software Testing the systematic discovery and debugging of defects Operations the installation migration support and maintenance of complete systems Thus the waterfall model maintains that one should move to a phase only when its preceding phase is reviewed and verified Various modified waterfall models including Royces final model however can include slight or major variations on this process 3 These variations included returning to the previous cycle after flaws were found downstream or returning all the way to the design phase if downstream phases deemed insufficient Supporting arguments edit Time spent early in the software production cycle can reduce costs at later stages For example a problem found in the early stages such as requirements specification is cheaper to fix than the same bug found later on in the process by a factor of 50 to 200 8 In common practice waterfall methodologies result in a project schedule with 2040 of the time invested for the first two phases 3040 of the time to coding and the rest dedicated to testing and implementation The actual project organisation needs to be highly structured Most medium and large projects will include a detailed set of procedures and controls which regulate every process on the project 9 A further argument for the waterfall model is that it places emphasis on documentation such as requirements documents and design documents as well as source code In less thoroughly designed and documented methodologies knowledge is lost if team members leave before the project is completed and it may be difficult for a project to recover from the loss If a fully working design document is present as is the intent of Big Design Up Front and the waterfall model new team members or even entirely new teams should be able to familiarise themselves by reading the documents 10 The waterfall model provides a structured approach the model itself progresses linearly through discrete easily understandable and explainable phases and thus is easy to understand it also provides easily identifiable milestones in the development process It is perhaps for this reason that the waterfall model is used as a beginning example of a development model in many software engineering texts and courses 11 It is argued that the waterfall model can be suited to projects where requirements and scope are fixed the product itself is firm and stable and the technology is clearly understood 12 Criticism edit Clients may not know exactly what their requirements are before they see working software and so change their requirementsleading to redesign redevelopment and retesting and increased costs 13 Designers may not be aware of future difficulties when designing a new software product or feature in which case it is better to revise the design than persist in a design that does not account for any newly discovered constraints requirements or problems 14 Organisations may attempt to deal with a lack of concrete requirements from clients by employing systems analysts to examine existing manual systems and analyse what they do and how they might be replaced However in practice it is difficult to sustain a strict separation between systems analysis and programming 15 This is because implementing any nontrivial system will almost inevitably expose issues and edge cases that the systems analyst did not consider In response to the perceived problems with the pure waterfall model modified waterfall models were introduced such as Sashimi Waterfall with Overlapping Phases Waterfall with Subprojects and Waterfall with Risk Reduction 8 Some organisations such as the United States Department of Defense now have a stated preference against waterfalltype methodologies starting with MILSTD498 which encourages evolutionary acquisition and Iterative and Incremental Development 16 While advocates of agile software development argue the waterfall model is an ineffective process for developing software some sceptics suggest that the waterfall model is a false argument used purely to market alternative development methodologies 17 Rational Unified Process RUP phases acknowledge the programmatic need for milestones for keeping a project on track but encourage iterations especially within Disciplines within the Phases RUP Phases are often referred to as waterfalllike citation needed Modified waterfall models edit In response to the perceived problems with the pure waterfall model many modified waterfall models have been introduced These models may address some or all of the criticisms of the pure waterfall model These include the Rapid Development models that Steve McConnell calls modified waterfalls 8 Peter DeGraces sashimi model waterfall with overlapping phases waterfall with subprojects and waterfall with risk reduction Other software development model combinations such as incremental waterfall model also exist 18 Royces final model edit Winston W Royce s final model his intended improvement upon his initial waterfall model illustrated that feedback could should and often would lead from code testing to design as testing of code uncovered flaws in the design and from design back to requirements specification as design problems may necessitate the removal of conflicting or otherwise unsatisfiable undesignable requirements In the same paper Royce also advocated large quantities of documentation doing the job twice if possible a sentiment similar to that of Fred Brooks famous for writing the Mythical Man Month an influential book in software project management who advocated planning to throw one away and involving the customer as much as possible a sentiment similar to that of Extreme Programming See also edit List of software development philosophies Agile software
