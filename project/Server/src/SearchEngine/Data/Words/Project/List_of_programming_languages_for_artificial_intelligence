languages for artificial intelligence Contents 1 Languages 2 See also 3 Notes 4 References 41 Major AI textbooks 42 History of AI Languages edit AIML meaning Artificial Intelligence Markup Language 1 is an XML dialect 2 for use with ALICE type chatterbots IPL 3 was the first language developed for artificial intelligence It includes features intended to support programs that could perform general problem solving such as lists associations schemas frames dynamic memory allocation data types recursion associative retrieval functions as arguments generators streams and cooperative multitasking Lisp 4 is a practical mathematical notation for computer programs based on lambda calculus Linked lists are one of the Lisp languages major data structures and Lisp source code is itself made up of lists As a result Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or even new domainspecific programming languages embedded in Lisp There are many dialects of Lisp in use today among which are Common Lisp Scheme and Clojure Smalltalk has been used extensively for simulations neural networks machine learning and genetic algorithms It implements the purest and most elegant form of objectoriented programming using message passing Prolog 5 6 is a declarative language where programs are expressed in terms of relations and execution occurs by running queries over these relations Prolog is particularly useful for symbolic reasoning database and language parsing applications Prolog is widely used in AI today STRIPS is a language for expressing automated planning problem instances It expresses an initial state the goal states and a set of actions For each action preconditions what must be established before the action is performed and postconditions what is established after the action is performed are specified Planner is a hybrid between procedural and logical languages It gives a procedural interpretation to logical sentences where implications are interpreted with patterndirected inference POP11 is a reflective incrementally compiled programming language with many of the features of an interpreted language It is the core language of the Poplog programming environment developed originally by the University of Sussex and recently in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham which hosts the Poplog website It is often used to introduce symbolic programming techniques to programmers of more conventional languages like Pascal who find POP syntax more familiar than that of Lisp One of POP11s features is that it supports firstclass functions R is widely used in newstyle artificial intelligence involving statistical computations numerical analysis the use of Bayesian inference neural networks and in general Machine Learning In domains like finance biology sociology or medicine it is considered as one of the main standard languages It offers several paradigms of programming like vectorial computation functional programming and objectoriented programming It supports deep learning libraries like MXNet Keras or TensorFlow Python is widely used for artificial intelligence with packages for several applications including General AI Machine Learning Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks 7 Haskell is also a very good programming language for AI Lazy evaluation and the list and LogicT monads make it easy to express nondeterministic algorithms which is often the case Infinite data structures are great for search trees The languages features enable a compositional way of expressing the algorithms The only drawback is that working with graphs is a bit harder at first because of purity Wolfram Language includes a wide range of integrated machine learning capabilities from highly automated functions like Predict and Classify to functions based on specific methods and diagnostics The functions work on many types of data including numerical categorical time series textual and image 8 C 2011 onwards MATLAB Perl Julia programming language eg for machine learning using native or nonnative libraries See also edit
