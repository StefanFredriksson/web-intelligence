architecture of IBMs DeepQA used in Watson 11 Watson was created as a question answering QA computing system that IBM built to apply advanced natural language processing information retrieval knowledge representation automated reasoning and machine learning technologies to the field of open domain question answering 2 The key difference between QA technology and document search is that document search takes a keyword query and returns a list of documents ranked in order of relevance to the query often based on popularity and page ranking while QA technology takes a question expressed in natural language seeks to understand it in much greater detail and returns a precise answer to the question 12 When created IBM stated that more than 100 different techniques are used to analyze natural language identify sources find and generate hypotheses find and score evidence and merge and rank hypotheses 13 In recent years the Watson capabilities have been extended and the way in which Watson works has been changed to take advantage of new deployment models Watson on IBM Cloud and evolved machine learning capabilities and optimised hardware available to developers and researchers It is no longer purely a question answering QA computing system designed from QA pairs but can now see hear read talk taste interpret learn and recommend Software edit Watson uses IBMs DeepQA software and the Apache UIMA Unstructured Information Management Architecture framework implementation The system was written in various languages including Java C and Prolog and runs on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 operating system using the Apache Hadoop framework to provide distributed computing 14 15 16 Hardware edit The system is workloadoptimized integrating massively parallel POWER7 processors and built on IBMs DeepQA technology 17 which it uses to generate hypotheses gather massive evidence and analyze data 2 Watson employs a cluster of ninety IBM Power 750 servers each of which uses a 35GHz POWER7 eightcore processor with four threads per core In total the system has 2880 POWER7 processor threads and 16 terabytes of RAM 17 According to John Rennie Watson can process 500 gigabytes the equivalent of a million books per second 18 IBMs master inventor and senior consultant Tony Pearson estimated Watsons hardware cost at about three million dollars 19 Its Linpack performance stands at 80 TeraFLOPs which is about half as fast as the cutoff line for the Top 500 Supercomputers list 20 According to Rennie all content was stored in Watsons RAM for the Jeopardy game because data stored on hard drives would be too slow to be competitive with human Jeopardy champions 18 Data edit The sources of information for Watson include encyclopedias dictionaries thesauri newswire articles and literary works Watson also used databases taxonomies and ontologies Specifically DBPedia WordNet and Yago were used 21 The IBM team provided Watson with millions of documents including dictionaries encyclopedias and other reference material that it could use to build its knowledge 22 Operation edit The computers techniques for unravelling Jeopardy clues sounded just like mine That machine zeroes in on keywords in a clue then combs its memory in Watsons case a 15terabyte databank of human knowledge for clusters of associations with those words It rigorously checks the top hits against all the contextual information it can muster the category name the kind of answer being sought the time place and gender hinted at in the clue and so on And when it feels sure enough it decides to buzz This is all an instant intuitive process for a human Jeopardy player but I felt convinced that under the hood my brain was doing more or less the same thing Ken Jennings 23 Watson parses questions into different keywords and sentence fragments in order to find statistically related phrases 22 Watsons main innovation was not in the creation of a new algorithm for this operation but rather its ability to quickly execute hundreds of proven language analysis algorithms simultaneously 22 24 The more algorithms that find the same answer independently the more likely Watson is to be correct 22 Once Watson has a small number of potential solutions it is able to check against its database to ascertain whether the solution makes sense or not 22 Comparison with human players edit Ken Jennings Watson and Brad Rutter in their Jeopardy exhibition match Watsons basic working principle is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses This gives Watson some advantages and disadvantages compared with human Jeopardy players 25 Watson has deficiencies in understanding the contexts of the clues As a result human players usually generate responses faster than Watson especially to short clues 22 Watsons programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response 22 Watson has consistently better reaction time on the buzzer once it has generated a response and is immune to human players psychological tactics such as jumping between categories on every clue 22 26 In a sequence of 20 mock games of Jeopardy human participants were able to use the average six to seven seconds that Watson needed to hear the clue and decide whether to signal for responding 22 During that time Watson also has to evaluate the response and determine whether it is sufficiently confident in the result to signal 22 Part of the system used to win the Jeopardy contest was the electronic circuitry that receives the ready signal and then examined whether Watsons confidence level was great enough to activate the buzzer Given the speed of this circuitry compared to the speed of human reaction times Watsons reaction time was faster than the human contestants except when the human anticipated instead of reacted to the ready signal 27 After signaling Watson speaks with an electronic voice and gives the responses in Jeopardy s question format 22 Watsons voice was synthesized from recordings that actor Jeff Woodman made for an IBM texttospeech program in 2004 28 The Jeopardy staff used different means to notify Watson and the human players when to buzz 27 which was critical in many rounds 26 The humans were notified by a light which took them tenths of a second to perceive 29 30 Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds 31 The humans tried to compensate for the perception delay by anticipating the light 32 but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watsons response time 26 Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal 30 32 History edit Development edit Since Deep Blue s victory over Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997 IBM had been on the hunt for a new challenge In 2004 IBM Research manager Charles Lickel over dinner with coworkers noticed that the restaurant they were in had fallen silent He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus Ken Jennings who was then in the middle of his successful 74game run on Jeopardy Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions midmeal to watch Jeopardy Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM Lickel passed the idea on and in 2005 IBM Research executive Paul Horn supported Lickel pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy with an IBM system Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer 33 In competitions managed by the United States government Watsons predecessor a system named Piquant was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35 of clues and often required several minutes to respond 34 35 36 To compete successfully on Jeopardy Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds and at that time the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve 22 In initial tests run during 2006 by David Ferrucci the senior manager of IBMs Semantic Analysis and Integration department Watson was given 500 clues from past Jeopardy programs While the best reallife competitors buzzed in half the time and responded correctly to as many as 95 of clues Watsons first pass could get only about 15 correct During 2007 the IBM team was given three to five years and a staff of 15 people to solve the problems 22 By 2008 the developers had advanced Watson such that it could compete with Jeopardy champions 22 By February 2010 Watson could beat human Jeopardy contestants on a regular basis 37 During the game Watson had access to 200 million pages of structured and unstructured content consuming four terabytes of disk storage 14 including the full text of the 2011 edition of Wikipedia 38 but was not connected to the Internet 39 22 For each clue Watsons three most probable responses were displayed on the television screen Watson consistently outperformed its human opponents on the games signaling device but had trouble in a few categories notably those having short clues containing only a few words Although the system is primarily an IBM effort Watsons development involved faculty and graduate students from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Carnegie Mellon University University of Massachusetts Amherst the University of Southern California s Information Sciences Institute the University of Texas at Austin the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Trento 11 as well as students from New York Medical College 40 Jeopardy edit Preparation edit Watson demo at an IBM booth at a trade show In 2008 IBM representatives communicated with Jeopardy executive producer Harry Friedman about the possibility of having Watson compete against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter two of the most successful contestants on the show and the programs producers agreed 22 41 Watsons differences with human players had generated conflicts between IBM and Jeopardy staff during the planning of the competition 25 IBM repeatedly expressed concerns that the shows writers would exploit Watsons cognitive deficiencies when writing the clues thereby turning the game into a Turing test To alleviate that claim a third party randomly picked the clues from previously written shows that were never broadcast 25 Jeopardy staff also showed concerns over Watsons reaction time on the buzzer Originally Watson signalled electronically but show staff requested that it press a button physically as the human contestants would 42 Even with a robotic finger pressing the buzzer Watson remained faster than its human competitors Ken Jennings noted If youre trying to win on the show the buzzer is all and that Watson can knock out a microsecondprecise buzz every single time with little or no variation Human reflexes cant compete with computer circuits in this regard 26 32 43 Stephen Baker a journalist who recorded Watsons development in his book Final Jeopardy reported that the conflict between IBM and Jeopardy became so serious in May 2010 that the competition was almost canceled 25 As part of the preparation IBM constructed a mock set in a conference room at one of its technology sites to model the one used on Jeopardy Human players including former Jeopardy contestants also participated in mock games against Watson with Todd Alan Crain of The Onion playing host 22 About 100 test matches were conducted with Watson winning 65 of the games 44 To provide a physical presence in the televised games Watson was represented by an avatar of a globe inspired by the IBM smarter planet symbol Jennings described the computers avatar as a glowing blue ball crisscrossed by threads of thought42 threads to be precise 23 and stated that the number of thought threads in the avatar was an injoke referencing the significance of the number 42 in Douglas Adams Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy 23 Joshua Davis the artist who designed the avatar for the project explained to Stephen Baker that there are 36 triggerable states that Watson was able to use throughout the game to show its confidence in responding to a clue correctly he had hoped to be able to find fortytwo to add another level to the Hitchhikers Guide reference but he was unable to pinpoint enough game states 45 A practice match was recorded on January 13 2011 and the official matches were recorded on January 14 2011 All participants maintained secrecy about the outcome until the match was broadcast in February 46 Practice match edit In a practice match before the press on January 13 2011 Watson won a 15question round against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter with a score of 4400 to Jenningss 3400 and Rutters 1200 though Jennings and Watson were tied before the final 1000 question None of the three players responded incorrectly to a clue 47 First match edit The first round was broadcast February 14 2011 and the second round on February 15 2011 The right to choose the first category had been determined by a draw won by Rutter 48 Watson represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of the first category a deliberate strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible 49 Watsons guess at the Daily Double location was correct At the end of the first round Watson was tied with Rutter at 5000 Jennings had 2000 48 Watsons performance was characterized by some quirks In one instance Watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by Jennings Jennings said What are the 20s in reference to the 1920s Then Watson said What is 1920s Because Watson could not recognize other contestants responses it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response In another instance Watson was initially given credit for a response of What is a leg after Jennings incorrectly responded What is he only had one hand to a clue about George Eyser the correct response was What is hes missing a leg Because Watson unlike a human could not have been responding to Jenningss mistake it was decided that this response was incorrect The broadcast version of the episode was edited to omit Trebeks original acceptance of Watsons response 50 Watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on the Daily Doubles with one bet at 6435 and another at 1246 51 Gerald Tesauro one of the IBM researchers who worked on Watson explained that Watsons wagers were based on its confidence level for the category and a complex regression model called the Game State Evaluator 52 Watson took a commanding lead in Double Jeopardy correctly responding to both Daily Doubles Watson responded to the second Daily Double correctly with a 32 confidence score 51 Although it wagered only 947 on the clue Watson was the only contestant to miss the Final Jeopardy response in the category US CITIES Its largest airport was named for a World War II hero its second largest for a World War II battle Rutter and Jennings gave the correct response of Chicago but Watsons response was What is Toronto 51 53 54 Ferrucci offered reasons why Watson would appear to have guessed a Canadian city categories only weakly suggest the type of response desired the phrase US city did not appear in the question there are cities named Toronto in the US and Toronto in Ontario has an American League baseball team 55 Dr Chris Welty who also worked on Watson suggested that it may not have been able to correctly parse the second part of the clue its second largest for a World War II battle which was not a standalone clause despite it following a semicolon and required context to understand that it was referring to a secondlargest airport 56 Eric Nyberg a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the development team stated that the error occurred because Watson does not possess the comparative knowledge to discard that potential response as not viable 54 Although not displayed to the audience as with nonFinal Jeopardy questions Watsons second choice was Chicago Both Toronto and Chicago were well below Watsons confidence threshold at 14 and 11 respectively This lack of confidence was the reason for the multiple question marks in Watsons response The game ended with Jennings with 4800 Rutter with 10400 and Watson with 35734 51 Second match edit During the introduction Trebek a Canadian native joked that he had learned Toronto was a US city and Watsons error in the first match prompted an IBM engineer to wear a Toronto Blue Jays jacket to the recording of the second match 57 In the first round Jennings was finally able to choose a Daily Double clue 58 while Watson responded to one Daily Double clue incorrectly for the first time in the Double Jeopardy Round 59 After the first round Watson placed second for the first time in the competition after Rutter and Jennings were briefly successful in increasing their dollar values before Watson could respond 59 60 Nonetheless the final result ended with a victory for Watson with a score of 77147 besting Jennings who scored 24000 and Rutter who scored 21600 61 Final outcome edit The prizes for the competition were 1 million for first place Watson 300000 for second place Jennings and 200000 for third place Rutter As promised IBM donated 100 of Watsons winnings to charity with 50 of those winnings going to World Vision and 50 going to World Community Grid 62 Similarly Jennings and Rutter donated 50 of their winnings to their respective charities 63 In acknowledgment of IBM and Watsons achievements Jennings made an additional remark in his Final Jeopardy response I for one welcome our new computer overlords echoing a similar memetic reference to the episode Deep Space Homer on The Simpsons in which TV news presenter Kent Brockman speaks of welcoming our new insect overlords 64 65 Jennings later wrote an article for Slate in which he stated IBM has bragged to the media that Watsons questionanswering skills are good for more than annoying Alex Trebek The company sees a future in which fields like medical diagnosis business analytics and tech support are automated by questionanswering software like Watson Just as factory jobs were eliminated in the 20th century by new assemblyline robots Brad and I were the first knowledgeindustry workers put out of work by the new generation of thinking machines Quiz show contestant may be the first job made redundant by Watson but Im sure it wont be the last 23 Philosophy edit Philosopher John Searle argues that Watsondespite impressive capabilitiescannot actually think 66 Drawing on his Chinese room thought experiment Searle claims that Watson like other computational machines is capable only of manipulating symbols but has no ability to understand the meaning of those symbols however Searles experiment has its detractors 67 Match against members of the United States Congress edit On February 28 2011 Watson played an untelevised exhibition match of Jeopardy against members of the United States House of Representatives In the first round Rush D Holt Jr DNJ a former Jeopardy contestant who was challenging the computer with Bill Cassidy RLA later Senator from Louisiana led with Watson in second place However combining the scores between all matches the final score was 40300 for Watson and 30000 for the congressional players combined 68 IBMs Christopher Padilla said of the match The technology behind Watson represents a major advancement in computing In the dataintensive environment of government this type of technology can help organizations make better decisions and improve how government helps its citizens 68 Current and future applications edit This section contains content that

understanding the questions that humans ask and providing answers that humans can understand and justify 37 It has been suggested by Robert C Weber IBMs general counsel that Watson may be used for legal research 69 The company also intends to use Watson in other informationintensive fields such as telecommunications financial services and government 70 Watson is based on commercially available IBM Power 750 servers that have been marketed since February 2010 IBM also intends to market the DeepQA software to large corporations with a price in the millions of dollars reflecting the 1 million needed to acquire a server that meets the minimum system requirement to operate Watson IBM expects the price to decrease substantially within a decade as the technology improves 22 Commentator Rick Merritt said that theres another really important reason why it is strategic for IBM to be seen very broadly by the American public as a company that can tackle tough computer problems A big slice of IBMs profit comes from selling to the US government some of the biggest most expensive systems in the world 71 In 2013 it was reported that three companies were working with IBM to create apps embedded with Watson technology Fluid is developing an app for retailers one called The North Face which is designed to provide advice to online shoppers Welltok is developing an app designed to give people advice on ways to engage in activities to improve their health MD Buyline is developing an app for the purpose of advising medical institutions on equipment procurement decisions 72 73 In November 2013 IBM announced it would make Watsons API available to software application providers enabling them to build apps and services that are embedded in Watsons capabilities To build out its base of partners who create applications on the Watson platform IBM consults with a network of venture capital firms which advise IBM on which of their portfolio companies may be a logical fit for what IBM calls the Watson Ecosystem Thus far roughly 800 organizations and individuals have signed up with IBM with interest in creating applications that could use the Watson platform 74 On January 30 2013 it was announced that Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute would receive a successor version of Watson which would be housed at the Institutes technology park and be available to researchers and

droughtstricken California improve water conservation efforts 86 In September 2016 Condé Nast has started using IBMs Watson to help build and strategize social influencer campaigns for brands Using software built by IBM and Influential Condé Nasts clients will be able to know which influencers demographics personality traits and more best align with a marketer and the audience it is targeting 87 In February 2017 Rare Carat a New York City based startup and ecommerce platform for buying diamonds and diamond rings introduced an IBM Watsonpowered artificial intelligence chatbot called Rocky to assist novice diamond buyers through the daunting process of purchasing a diamond As part of the IBM Global Entrepreneur Program Rare Carat received the assistance of IBM in the development of the Rocky Chat Bot 88 89 90 In May 2017 IBM partnered with the Pebble Beach Company to use Watson as a concierge 91 Watsons artificial intelligence was added to an app developed by Pebble Beach and was used to guide visitors around the resort The mobile app was designed by IBM iX and hosted on the IBM Cloud It uses Watsons Conversation applications programming interface In November 2017 in Mexico City the Experience Voices of Another Time was opened at the National Museum of Anthropology using IBM Watson as an alternative to visiting a museum 92 Healthcare edit In healthcare Watsons natural language hypothesis generation and evidencebased learning capabilities are being investigated to see how Watson may contribute to clinical decision support systems and the increase in artificial intelligence in healthcare for use by medical professionals 93 To aid physicians in the treatment of their patients once a physician has posed a query to the system describing symptoms and other related factors Watson first parses the input to identify the most important pieces of information then mines patient data to find facts relevant to the patients medical and hereditary history then examines available data sources to form and test hypotheses 93 and finally provides a list of individualized confidencescored recommendations 94 The sources of data that Watson uses for analysis can include treatment guidelines electronic medical record data notes from healthcare providers research materials clinical studies journal articles and patient information 93 Despite being developed and marketed as a diagnosis and treatment advisor Watson has never been actually involved in the medical diagnosis process only in assisting with identifying treatment options for patients who have already been diagnosed 95 In February 2011 it was announced that IBM would be partnering with Nuance Communications for a research project to develop a commercial product during the next 18 to 24 months designed to exploit Watsons clinical decision support capabilities Physicians at Columbia University would help to identify critical issues in the practice of medicine where the systems technology may be able to contribute and physicians at the University of Maryland would work to identify the best way that a technology like Watson could interact with medical practitioners to provide the maximum assistance 96 In September 2011 IBM and WellPoint now Anthem announced a partnership to utilize Watsons data crunching capability to help suggest treatment options to physicians 97 Then in February 2013 IBM and WellPoint gave Watson its first commercial application for utilization management decisions in lung cancer treatment at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center 9 IBM announced a partnership with Cleveland Clinic in October 2012 The company has sent Watson to the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University where it will increase its health expertise and assist medical professionals in treating patients The medical facility will utilize Watsons ability to store and process large quantities of information to help speed up and increase the accuracy of the treatment process Cleveland Clinics collaboration with IBM is exciting because it offers us the opportunity to teach Watson to think in ways that have the potential to make it a powerful tool in medicine said C Martin Harris MD chief information officer of Cleveland Clinic 98 In 2013 IBM and MD Anderson Cancer Center began a pilot program to further the centers mission to eradicate cancer 99 100 However after spending 62 million the project did not meet its goals and it has been stopped 101 On February 8 2013 IBM announced that oncologists at the Maine Center for
