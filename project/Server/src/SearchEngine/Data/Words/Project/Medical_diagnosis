Medical diagnosis Radiography is an important tool in diagnosis of certain disorders Medical diagnosis abbreviated Dx 1 or D S is the process of determining which disease or condition explains a persons symptoms and signs It is most often referred to as diagnosis with the medical context being implicit The information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care Often one or more diagnostic procedures such as medical tests are also done during the process Sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis Diagnosis is often challenging because many signs and symptoms are nonspecific For example redness of the skin erythema by itself is a sign of many disorders and thus does not tell the healthcare professional what is wrong Thus differential diagnosis in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted must be performed This involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns Occasionally the process is made easy by a sign or symptom or a group of several that is pathognomonic Diagnosis is a major component of the procedure of a doctors visit From the point of view of statistics the diagnostic procedure involves classification tests Contents 1 Medical uses 2 Procedure 21 Differential

regarded as an attempt at classification of an individuals condition into separate and distinct categories that allow medical decisions about treatment and prognosis to be made Subsequently a diagnostic opinion is often described in terms of a disease or other condition In the case of a wrong diagnosis however the individuals actual disease or condition is not the same as the individuals diagnosis A diagnostic procedure may be performed by various healthcare professionals such as a physician physiotherapist dentist podiatrist optometrist nurse practitioner healthcare scientist or physician assistant This article uses diagnostician as any of these person categories A diagnostic procedure as well as the opinion reached thereby does not necessarily involve elucidation of the etiology of the diseases or conditions of interest that is what caused the disease or condition Such elucidation can be useful to optimize treatment further specify the prognosis or prevent recurrence of the disease or condition in the future The initial task is to detect a medical indication to perform a diagnostic procedure Indications include Detection of any deviation from what is known to be normal such as can be described in terms of for example anatomy the structure of the human body physiology how the body works pathology what can go wrong with the anatomy and physiology psychology thought and behavior and human homeostasis regarding mechanisms to keep body systems in balance Knowledge of what is normal and measuring of the patients current condition against those norms can assist in determining the patients particular departure from homeostasis and the degree of departure which in turn can assist in quantifying the indication for further diagnostic processing A complaint expressed by a patient The fact that a patient has sought a diagnostician can itself be an indication to perform a diagnostic procedure For example in a doctors visit the physician may already start performing a diagnostic procedure by watching the gait of the patient from the waiting room to the doctors office even before she or he has started to present any complaints Even during an already ongoing diagnostic procedure there can be an indication to perform another separate diagnostic procedure for another potentially concomitant disease or condition This may occur as a result of an incidental finding of a sign unrelated to the parameter of interest such as can occur in comprehensive tests such as radiological studies like magnetic resonance imaging or blood test panels that also include blood tests that are not relevant for the ongoing diagnosis Procedure edit General components which are present in a diagnostic procedure in most of the various available methods include Complementing the already given information with further data gathering which may include questions of the medical history potentially from other people close to the patient as well physical examination and various diagnostic tests A diagnostic test is any kind of medical test performed to aid in the diagnosis or detection of disease Diagnostic tests can also be used to provide prognostic information on people with established disease 2 Processing of the answers findings or other results Consultations with other providers and specialists in the field may be sought There are a number of methods or techniques that can be used in a diagnostic procedure including performing a differential diagnosis or following medical algorithms 3 In reality a diagnostic procedure may involve components of multiple methods 4 Differential diagnosis edit Main article Differential diagnosis The method of differential diagnosis is based on finding as many candidate diseases or conditions as possible that can possibly cause the signs or symptoms followed by a process of elimination or at least of rendering the entries more or less probable by further medical tests and other processing until aiming to reach the point where only one candidate disease or condition remains as probable The final result may also remain a list of possible conditions ranked in order of probability or severity The resultant diagnostic opinion by this method can be regarded more or less as a diagnosis of exclusion Even if it does not result in a single probable disease or condition it can at least rule out any imminently lifethreatening conditions Unless the provider is certain of the condition present further medical tests such as medical imaging are performed or scheduled in part to confirm or disprove the diagnosis but also to document the patients status and keep the patients medical history up to date If unexpected findings are made during this process the initial hypothesis may be ruled out and the provider must then consider other hypotheses Pattern recognition edit In a pattern recognition method the provider uses experience to recognize a pattern of clinical characteristics 3 It is mainly based on certain symptoms or signs being associated with certain diseases or conditions not necessarily involving the more cognitive processing involved in a differential diagnosis This may be the primary method used in cases where diseases are obvious or the providers experience may enable him or her to recognize the condition quickly Theoretically a certain pattern of signs or symptoms can be directly associated with a certain therapy even without a definite decision regarding what is the actual disease but such a compromise carries a substantial risk of missing a diagnosis which actually has a different therapy so it may be limited to cases where no diagnosis can be made Diagnostic criteria edit Main article Clinical case definition The term diagnostic criteria designates the specific combination of signs symptoms and test results that the clinician uses to attempt to determine the correct diagnosis Some examples of diagnostic criteria also known as clinical case definitions are Amsterdam criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer McDonald criteria for multiple sclerosis ACR criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus Centor criteria for strep throat Clinical decision support system edit Clinical decision support systems are interactive computer programs designed to assist health professionals with decisionmaking tasks The clinician interacts with the software utilizing both the clinicians knowledge and the software to make a better analysis of the patients data than either human or software could make on their own Typically the system makes suggestions for the clinician to look through and the clinician picks useful information and removes erroneous suggestions 5 Other diagnostic procedure methods edit Other methods that can be used in performing a diagnostic procedure include An example of a medical algorithm for assessment and treatment of overweight and obesity Usage of medical algorithms An exhaustive method in which every possible question is asked and all possible data is collected 3 This is often referred to as a diagnostic workup 6 Use of a sensory pill that collects and transmits physiological information after being swallowed 7 Using optical coherence tomography to produce detailed images of the brain or other soft tissue through a window made of zirconia that has been modified to be transparent and implanted in the skull 8 Adverse effects edit Diagnosis problems are the dominant cause of medical malpractice payments accounting for 35 of total payments in a study of 25 years of data and 350000 claims 9 Overdiagnosis edit Main article Overdiagnosis Overdiagnosis is the diagnosis of disease that will never cause symptoms or death during a patients lifetime 10 It is a problem because it turns people into patients unnecessarily and because it can lead to economic waste 11 overutilization and treatments that may cause harm Overdiagnosis occurs when a disease is diagnosed correctly but the diagnosis is irrelevant A correct diagnosis may be irrelevant because treatment for the disease is not available not needed or not wanted 12 Errors edit Further information Medical error Most people will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime according to a 2015 report by the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine 13 Causes and factors of error in diagnosis are 14 the manifestation of disease are not sufficiently noticeable a disease is omitted from consideration too much significance is given to some aspect of the diagnosis the condition is a rare disease with symptoms suggestive of many other conditions the condition has a rare presentation Lag time edit When making a medical diagnosis a lag time is a delay in time until a step towards diagnosis of a disease or condition is made Types of lag times are mainly Onsettomedical encounter lag time the time from onset of symptoms until visiting a health care provider 15 Encountertodiagnosis lag time the time from first medical encounter to diagnosis 15 Lag time due to delays in reading xrays have been cited as a major challenge in care delivery The Department of Health and Human Services has reportedly found that interpretation of xrays is rarely available to emergency room physicians prior to patient discharge 16 History edit Main article History of medical diagnosis The first recorded examples of medical diagnosis are found in the writings of Imhotep 26302611 BC in ancient Egypt the Edwin Smith Papyrus 17 A Babylonian medical textbook the Diagnostic Handbook written by Esagilkinapli fl 10691046 BC introduced the use of empiricism logic and rationality in the diagnosis of an illness or disease 18 Traditional Chinese Medicine as described in the Yellow Emperors Inner Canon or Huangdi Neijing specified four diagnostic methods inspection auscultationolfaction interrogation and palpation 19 Hippocrates was known to make diagnoses by tasting his patients urine and smelling their sweat 20 Society and culture edit Etymology edit The plural of diagnosis is diagnoses The verb is to diagnose and a person who diagnoses is called a diagnostician The word diagnosis d aɪ ə ɡ ˈ n oʊ s ɪ s is derived through Latin from the Greek word διάγνωσις diágnōsis from διαγιγνώσκειν diagignṓskein meaning to discern distinguish 21 Medical diagnosis or the actual process of making a diagnosis is a cognitive process A clinician uses several sources of data and puts the pieces of the puzzle together to make a diagnostic impression The initial diagnostic impression can be a broad term describing a category of diseases instead of a specific disease or condition After the initial diagnostic impression the clinician obtains follow up tests and procedures to get more data to support or reject the original diagnosis and will attempt to narrow it down to a more specific level Diagnostic procedures are the specific tools that the clinicians use to narrow the diagnostic possibilities Social context edit Diagnosis can take many forms 22 It might be a matter of naming the disease lesion dysfunction or disability It might be a managementnaming or prognosisnaming exercise It may indicate either degree of abnormality on a continuum or kind of abnormality in a classification Its influenced by nonmedical factors such as power ethics and financial incentives for patient or doctor It can be a brief summation or an extensive formulation even taking the form of a story or metaphor It might be a means of communication such as a computer code through which it triggers payment prescription notification information or advice It might be pathogenic or salutogenic Its generally uncertain and provisional Once a diagnostic opinion has been reached the provider is able to propose a management plan which will include treatment as well as plans for followup From this point on in addition to treating the patients condition the provider can educate the patient about the etiology progression prognosis other outcomes and possible treatments of her or his ailments as well as providing advice for maintaining health A treatment plan is proposed which may include therapy and followup consultations and tests to monitor the condition and the progress of the treatment if needed usually according to the medical guidelines provided by the medical field on the treatment of the particular illness Relevant information should be added to the medical record of the patient A failure to respond to treatments that would normally work may indicate a need for review of the diagnosis Nancy McWilliams identifies five reasons that determine the necessity for diagnosis diagnosis for treatment planning information contained in it related to prognosis protecting interests of patients a diagnosis might help the therapist to empathize with his patient might reduce the likelihood that some fearful patients will goby the treatment 23 Related concepts edit Subtypes of diagnoses include Clinical diagnosis A diagnosis made on the basis of medical signs and reported symptoms rather than diagnostic tests Laboratory diagnosis A diagnosis based significantly on laboratory reports or test results rather than the physical examination of the patient For instance a proper diagnosis of infectious diseases usually requires both an examination of signs and symptoms as well as laboratory test results and characteristics of the pathogen involved Radiology diagnosis A diagnosis based primarily on the results from medical imaging studies Greenstick fractures are common radiological diagnoses Tissue diagnosis A diagnosis based on the macroscopic microscopic and molecular examination of tissues such as biopsies or whole organs For example a definitive diagnosis of cancer is made via tissue examination by a pathologist Principal diagnosis The single medical diagnosis that is most relevant to the patients chief complaint or need for treatment Many patients have additional diagnoses Admitting diagnosis The diagnosis given as the reason why the patient was admitted to the hospital it may differ from the actual problem or from the discharge diagnoses which are the diagnoses recorded when the patient is discharged from the hospital 24 Differential diagnosis A process of identifying all of the possible diagnoses that could be connected to the signs symptoms and lab findings and then ruling out diagnoses until a final determination can be made Diagnostic criteria Designates the combination of signs symptoms and test results that the clinician uses to attempt to determine the correct diagnosis They are standards normally published by international committees and they are designed to offer the best sensitivity and specificity possible respect the presence of a condition with the stateoftheart technology Prenatal diagnosis Diagnosis work done before birth Diagnosis of exclusion A medical condition whose presence cannot be established with complete confidence from history examination or testing Diagnosis is therefore by elimination of all other reasonable possibilities Dual diagnosis The diagnosis of two related but separate medical conditions or comorbidities the term almost always refers to a diagnosis of a serious mental illness and a substance addiction Selfdiagnosis The diagnosis or identification of a medical conditions in oneself Selfdiagnosis is very common Remote diagnosis A type of telemedicine that diagnoses a patient without being physically in the same room as the patient Nursing diagnosis Rather than focusing on biological processes a nursing diagnosis identifies peoples responses to situations in their lives such as a readiness to change or a willingness to accept assistance Computeraided diagnosis Providing symptoms allows the computer to identify the problem and diagnose the user to the best of its ability Health screening begins by identifying the part of the body where the symptoms are located the computer crossreferences a database for the corresponding disease and presents a diagnosis 25 Overdiagnosis The diagnosis of disease that will never cause symptoms distress or death during a patients lifetime Wastebasket diagnosis A vague or even completely fake medical or psychiatric label given to the patient or to the medical records department for essentially nonmedical reasons such as to reassure the patient by providing an officialsounding label to make the provider look effective or to obtain approval for treatment This term is also used as a derogatory label for disputed poorly described overused or questionably classified diagnoses such as pouchitis and senility or to dismiss diagnoses that amount to overmedicalization such as the labeling of normal responses to physical hunger as reactive hypoglycemia Retrospective diagnosis The labeling of an illness in a historical figure or specific historical event using modern knowledge
