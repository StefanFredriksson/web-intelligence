Intelligent agent Software agent which acts autonomously For the term in intelligent design see intelligent designer This article needs attention from an expert in Robotics Please add a reason or a talk parameter to this template to explain the issue with the article WikiProject Robotics may be able to help recruit an expert October 2009 In artificial intelligence an intelligent agent IA refers to an autonomous entity which acts directing its activity towards achieving goals ie it is an agent upon an environment using observation through sensors and consequent actuators ie it is intelligent citation needed Intelligent agents may also learn or use knowledge to achieve their goals They may be very simple or very complex A reflex machine such as a thermostat is considered an example of an intelligent agent 1 Simple reflex agent Intelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program For this reason intelligent agents are sometimes called abstract intelligent agents AIA to distinguish them from their real world implementations as computer systems biological systems or organizations Some definitions of intelligent agents emphasize their autonomy and so prefer the term autonomous intelligent agents Still others notably Russell Norvig 2003 considered goaldirected behavior as the essence of intelligence and so prefer a term borrowed from economics rational agent Intelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science ethics the philosophy of practical reason as well as in many interdisciplinary sociocognitive modeling and computer social simulations Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users In computer science the term intelligent agent may be used to refer to a software agent that has some intelligence regardless if it is not a rational agent by Russell and Norvigs definition For example autonomous programs used for operator assistance or data mining sometimes referred to as bots are also called intelligent agents Contents 1 A variety of definitions 2 Structure of agents 3 Architectures 4 Classes 41 Simple reflex agents 42 Modelbased reflex agents 43 Goalbased agents 44

many different ways 2 According to Nikola Kasabov 3 IA systems should exhibit the following characteristics Accommodate new problem solving rules incrementally Adapt online and in real time Are able to analyze themselves in terms of behavior error and success Learn and improve through interaction with the environment embodiment Learn quickly from large amounts of data Have memorybased exemplar storage and retrieval capacities Have parameters to represent short and long term memory age forgetting etc Structure of agents edit A simple agent program can be defined mathematically as a function f called the agent function 4 which maps every possible percepts sequence to a possible action the agent can perform or to a coefficient feedback element function or constant that affects eventual actions f P A displaystyle fPast rightarrow A Agent function is an abstract concept as it could incorporate various principles of decision making like calculation of utility of individual options deduction over logic rules fuzzy logic etc 5 The program agent instead maps every possible percept to an action citation needed We use the term percept to refer to the agents perceptional inputs at any given instant In the following figures an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators Architectures edit Weiss 2013 defines four classes of agents Logicbased agents in which the decision about what action to perform is made via logical deduction Reactive agents in which decision making is implemented in some form of direct mapping from situation to action Beliefdesireintention agents in which decision making depends upon the manipulation of data structures representing the beliefs desires and intentions of the agent and finally Layered architectures in which decision making is realized via various software layers each of which is more or less explicitly reasoning about the environment at different levels of abstraction Generally an agent can be constructed by separating the body into the sensors and actuators and so that it operates with a complex perception system that takes the description of the world as input for a controller and outputs commands to the actuator However a hierarchy of controller layers is often necessary to balance the immediate reaction desired for lowlevel tasks and the slow reasoning about complex highlevel goals 6 Classes edit Simple reflex agent Modelbased reflex agent Modelbased goalbased agent Modelbased utilitybased agent A general learning agent Russell Norvig 2003 group agents into five classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence and capability 7 simple reflex agents modelbased reflex agents goalbased agents utilitybased agents learning agents Simple reflex agents edit Simple reflex agents act only on the basis of the current percept ignoring the rest of the percept history The agent function is based on the conditionaction rule if condition then action This agent function only succeeds when the environment is fully observable Some reflex agents can also contain information on their current state which allows them to disregard conditions whose actuators are already triggered Infinite loops are often unavoidable for simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments Note If the agent can randomize its actions it may be possible to escape from infinite loops Modelbased reflex agents edit A modelbased agent can handle partially observable environments Its current state is stored inside the agent maintaining some kind of structure which describes the part of the world which cannot be seen This knowledge about how the world works is called a model of the world hence the name modelbased agent A modelbased reflex agent should maintain some sort of internal model that depends on the percept history and thereby reflects at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state Percept history and impact of action on the environment can be determined by using internal model It then chooses an action in the same way as reflex agent An agent may also use models to describe and predict the behaviors of other agents in the environment 8 Goalbased agents edit Goalbased agents further expand on the capabilities of the modelbased agents by using goal information Goal information describes situations that are desirable This allows the agent a way to choose among multiple possibilities selecting the one which reaches a goal state Search and planning are the subfields of artificial intelligence devoted to finding action sequences that achieve the agents goals Utilitybased agents edit Goalbased agents only distinguish between goal states and nongoal states It is possible to define a measure of how desirable a particular state is This measure can be obtained through the use of a utility function which maps a state to a measure of the utility of the state A more general performance measure should allow a comparison of different world states according to exactly how happy they would make the agent The term utility can be used to describe how happy the agent is A rational utilitybased agent chooses the action that maximizes the expected utility of the action outcomes that is what the agent expects to derive on average given the probabilities and utilities of each outcome A utilitybased agent has to model and keep track of its environment tasks that have involved a great deal of research on perception representation reasoning and learning Learning agents edit Learning has the advantage that it allows the agents to initially operate in unknown environments and to become more competent than its initial knowledge alone might allow The most important distinction is between the learning element which is responsible for making improvements and the performance element which is responsible for selecting external actions The learning element uses feedback from the critic on how the agent is doing and determines how the performance element should be modified to do better in the futureThe performance element is what we have previously considered to be the entire agent it takes in percepts and decides on actions The last component of the learning agent is the problem generator It is responsible for suggesting actions that will lead to new and informative experiences Hierarchies of agents edit Main article Multiagent system To actively perform their functions Intelligent Agents today are normally gathered in a hierarchical structure containing many subagents Intelligent subagents process and perform lower level functions Taken together the intelligent agent and subagents create a complete system that can accomplish difficult tasks or goals with behaviors and responses that display a form of intelligence Applications edit An example of an automated online assistant providing automated customer service on a webpage Intelligent agents are applied as automated online assistants where they function to perceive the needs of customers in order to perform individualized customer service Such an agent may basically consist of a dialog system an avatar as well an expert system to provide specific expertise to the user 9 They can also be used to optimize coordination of human groups online 10 See also
