Cooperation For other uses see Cooperation disambiguation This article is about Cooperation as used in the social sciences For cooperation in evolution see Cooperation evolution For the economic model see Cooperative Many animal species cooperate with each other in mutual symbiosis One example is the ocellaris clownfish which dwells among the tentacles of Ritteri sea anemones The anemones provide the clownfish with protection from their predators which cannot tolerate the stings of the sea anemones tentacles while the fish defend the anemones against butterflyfish which eat anemones Cooperation written as cooperation in British English is the process of groups of organisms working or acting together for common mutual or some underlying benefit as opposed to working in competition for selfish benefit 1 Many animal and plant species cooperate both with other members of their own species and with members of other species symbiosis or mutualism 2 Contents 1 Among humans 2 Among

immediate benefit genetic relatedness and reciprocity but also for particularly human reasons such as honesty signaling indirect reciprocity cultural group selection and for reasons having to do with cultural evolution 1 Language allows humans to cooperate on a very large scale Certain studies have suggested that fairness affects human cooperation individuals are willing to punish at their own cost altruistic punishment if they believe that they are being treated unfairly 3 4 Sanfey et al conducted an experiment where 19 individuals were scanned using MRI while playing an ultimatum game in the role of the responder 4 They received offers from other human partners and from a computer partner Responders refused unfair offers from human partners at a significantly higher rate than those from a computer partner The experiment also suggested that altruistic punishment is associated with negative emotions that are generated in unfair situations by the anterior insula of the brain 4 It has been observed that image scoring clarification needed promotes cooperative behavior in situations where direct reciprocity is unlikely 5 In situations where reputation and status are involved humans tend to cooperate more citation needed Among other animals edit Cooperation is common in nonhuman animals Besides cooperation with an immediate benefit for both actors this behavior appears to occur mostly between relatives 1 Spending time and resources assisting a related individual may at first seem destructive to the organisms chances of survival but is actually beneficial over the longterm Since relatives share part of their genetic makeup enhancing each others chances of survival may actually increase the likelihood that the helpers genetic traits will be passed on to future generations 6 The cooperative pulling paradigm is an experimental design used to assess if and under which conditions animals cooperate It involves two or more animals pulling rewards towards themselves via an apparatus they can not successfully operate alone 7 Some researchers assert that cooperation is more complex than this They maintain that helpers may receive more direct and less indirect gains from assisting others than is commonly reported Furthermore they insist that cooperation may not solely be an interaction between two individuals but may be part of the broader goal of unifying populations 8 Kin selection edit One specific form of cooperation in animals is kin selection which can be defined as animals helping to rear a relatives offspring in order to enhance their own fitness 6 8 Different theories explaining kin selection have been proposed including the paytostay and territory inheritance hypotheses The paytostay theory suggests that individuals help others rear offspring in order to return the favor of the breeders allowing them to live on their land The territory inheritance theory contends that individuals help in order to have improved access to breeding areas once the breeders depart These two hypotheses both appear to be valid at least in cichlid fish 9 Studies conducted on red wolves support previous researchers 8 contention that helpers obtain both immediate and longterm gains from cooperative breeding Researchers evaluated the consequences of red wolves decisions to stay with their packs for extended periods of time after birth It was found that this delayed dispersal while it involved helping other wolves rear their offspring extended male wolves life spans These findings suggest that kin selection may not only benefit an individual in the longterm in terms of increased fitness but in the shortterm as well through enhanced chance of survival 10 Some research even suggests that certain species provide more help to the individuals with which they are more closely related This phenomenon is known as kin discrimination 11 In their metaanalysis researchers compiled data on kin selection as mediated by genetic relatedness in 18 species including the Western bluebird Pied kingfisher Australian magpie and Dwarf Mongoose They found that different species exhibited varying degrees of kin discrimination with the largest frequencies occurring among those who have the most to gain from cooperative interactions 11 Cooperative systems edit Cooperation is a process by which the components of a system work together to achieve the global properties 1 In other words individual components that appear to be selfish and independent work together to create a highly complex greaterthanthesumofitsparts system The phenomenon is generally known as emergence and is considered an outcome of selforganization 12 Examples The components in a cell work together to keep it living Neurons create thought and consciousness other cells work together and communicate to produce multicellular organisms Organisms form food chains and ecosystems People form families tribes cities and nations Atoms cooperate in a simple way by combining to make up molecules Understanding the mechanisms that create cooperating agents in a system is one of the most important and least well understood phenomena in nature though there has not been a lack of effort citation needed Individual action on behalf of a larger system may be coerced forced voluntary freely chosen or even unintentional and consequently individuals and groups might act in concert even though they have almost nothing in common as regards interests or goals Examples of that can be found in market trade military wars families workplaces schools and prisons and more generally any institution or organization of which individuals are part out of own choice by law or forced citation needed The prisoners dilemma edit For many years the prisoners dilemma game pointed out that even if all members of a group would benefit if all cooperate individual selfinterest may not favor cooperation The prisoners dilemma codifies this problem and has been the subject of much research both theoretical and experimental Results from experimental economics show that humans often act more cooperatively than strict selfinterest would seem to dictate While economic experiments require subjects to make relatively abstract decisions for small stakes evidence from natural experiments for high stakes support the claim that humans act more cooperatively than strict selfinterest would dictate 13 One reason may be that if the prisoners dilemma situation is repeated the iterated prisoners dilemma it allows noncooperation to be punished more and cooperation to be rewarded more than the singleshot version of the problem would suggest It has been suggested that this is one reason for the evolution of complex emotions in higher life forms 14 15 See also
