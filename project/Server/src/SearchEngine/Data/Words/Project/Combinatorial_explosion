Combinatorial explosion In mathematics a combinatorial explosion is the rapid growth of the complexity of a problem due to how the combinatorics of the problem is affected by the input constraints and bounds of the problem Combinatorial explosion is sometimes used to justify the intractability of certain problems 1 2 Examples of such problems include certain mathematical functions the analysis of some puzzles and games and some pathological examples which can be modelled as the Ackermann function Contents 1 Examples 11 Latin squares 12 Sudoku 13 Games 14 Computing 15 Arithmetics 16 Communication 2 See also 3 References Examples edit Latin squares edit Main article Latin square A Latin square of order n is an n n array with entries from a set of n elements with the property that each element of the set occurs exactly once in each row and each column of the array An example of a Latin square of order three is given by 1 2 3 2 3 1 3 1 2 A common example of a Latin square would be a completed Sudoku puzzle 3 A Latin square is a combinatorial object as opposed to an algebraic object since only the arrangement of entries matters and not what the entries actually are The number of Latin squares as a function of the order independent of the set from which the entries are drawn sequence A002860 in the OEIS provides an example of combinatorial explosion as illustrated by the

on a grid such as Sudoku 2 A Sudoku is a type of Latin square with the additional property that each element occurs exactly once in subsections of size n n called boxes Combinatorial explosion occurs as n increases creating limits to the properties of Sudokus that can be constructed analyzed and solved as illustrated in the following table n The number of Sudoku grids of order n boxes are size n n

commonly played 99 Sudoku The puzzle does not include grids where n is irrational Games edit One example in a game where combinatorial complexity leads to a solvability limit is in solving chess a game with 64 squares and 32 pieces Chess is not a solved game In 2005 all chess game endings with six pieces or fewer were solved showing the result of each position if played perfectly It took ten more years to complete the tablebase with one more chess piece added thus completing a 7piece tablebase Adding one more piece to a chess ending thus making an 8piece tablebase is considered intractable due to the added combinatorial complexity 9 10 Furthermore the prospect of solving larger chesslike games becomes more difficult as the boardsize is increased such as in large chess variants and infinite chess 11 Computing edit Combinatorial explosion can occur in computing environments in a way analogous to communications and multidimensional space Imagine a simple system with only one variable a boolean called A The system has two possible states A true or A false Adding another boolean variable B will give the system four possible states A true and B true A true and B false A false and B true A false and B false A system with n booleans has 2 n possible states while a system of n variables each with Z allowed values rather than just the 2 true and false of booleans will have Z n possible states The possible states can be thought of as the leaf nodes of a tree of height n where each node has Z children This rapid increase of leaf nodes can be useful in areas like searching since many results can be accessed without having to descend very far It can also be a hindrance when manipulating such structures A class hierarchy in an objectoriented language can be thought of as a tree with different types of object inheriting from their parents If different classes need to be combined such as in a comparison like A B then the number of possible combinations which may occur explodes If each type of comparison needs to be programmed then this soon becomes intractable for even small numbers of classes Multiple inheritance can solve this by allowing subclasses to have multiple parents and thus a few parent classes can be considered rather than every child without disrupting any existing hierarchy An example is a taxonomy where different vegetables inherit from their ancestor species Attempting to compare the tastiness of each vegetable with the others becomes intractable since the hierarchy only contains information about genetics and makes no mention of tastiness However instead of having to write comparisons for carrotcarrot carrotpotato carrotsprout potatopotato potatosprout sproutsprout they can all multiply inherit from a separate class of tasty whilst keeping their current ancestorbased hierarchy then all of the above can be implemented with only a tastytasty comparison Arithmetics edit Suppose we take the factorial for n n n n 1 2 1 displaystyle nnn121 Then 1 1 2 2 3 6 and 4 24 However we quickly get to extremely large numbers even for relatively small n For example 100 933262154 10 157 a number so large that it cannot be displayed on most calculators and vastly larger than the estimated number of fundamental particles in the Universe 12 This article needs additional citations for verification Please help

Communication edit In administration and computing a combinatorial explosion is the rapidly accelerating increase in communication lines as organizations are added in a process This growth is often casually described as exponential but is actually polynomial If two organizations need to communicate about a particular topic it may be easiest to communicate directly in an ad hoc manneronly one channel of communication is required However if a third organization is added three separate channels are required Adding a fourth organization requires six channels five ten six fifteen etc In general going on like that it will take l n n 1 2 n 2 displaystyle lfrac nn12n choose 2 communication lines for n organizations which is just the number of 2 combinations of n elements see also binomial coefficient 13 The alternative approach is to realize when this communication will not be a oneoff requirement and produce a generic or intermediate way of passing information The drawback is that this requires more work for the first pair since each must convert its internal approach to the common one rather than the superficially easier approach of just understanding the other See also
