Modern Prometheus 1818 She also edited and promoted the works of her husband the Romantic poet and philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley Her father was the political philosopher William Godwin and her mother was the philosopher and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft Shelleys mother died less than a month after giving birth to her She was raised by her father who was able to provide her with a rich if informal education encouraging her to adhere to his own anarchist political theories When she was four her father married a neighbour with whom Shelley came to have a troubled relationship 2 3 In 1814 Shelley began a romance with one of her fathers political followers Percy Bysshe Shelley who was already married Together with her stepsister Claire Clairmont she and Percy left for France and travelled through Europe Upon their return to England Shelley was pregnant with Percys child Over the next two years she and Percy faced ostracism constant debt and the death of their prematurely born daughter They married in late 1816 after the suicide of Percy Shelleys first wife Harriet In 1816 the couple famously spent a summer with Lord Byron John William Polidori and Claire Clairmont near Geneva Switzerland where Shelley conceived the idea for her novel Frankenstein The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy where their second and third children died before Shelley gave birth to her last and only surviving child Percy Florence Shelley In 1822 her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near Viareggio A year later Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author The last decade of her life was dogged by illness most likely caused by the brain tumour which killed her at age 53 Until the 1970s Shelley was known mainly for her efforts to publish her husbands works and for her novel Frankenstein which remains widely read and has inspired many theatrical and film adaptations Recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of Shelleys achievements Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output particularly in her novels which include the historical novels Valperga 1823 and Perkin Warbeck 1830 the apocalyptic novel The Last Man 1826 and her final two novels Lodore 1835 and Falkner 1837 Studies of her lesserknown works such as the travel book Rambles in Germany and Italy 1844 and the biographical articles for Dionysius Lardner s Cabinet Cyclopaedia 18291846 support the growing view that Shelley remained a political radical throughout her life Shelleys works often argue that cooperation and sympathy particularly as practised by women in the family were the ways to reform civil society This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic Romantic ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the Enlightenment political theories articulated by her father William Godwin mwparseroutput toclimit2 toclevel1 ulmwparseroutput toclimit3

from William Godwin s journal recording Birth of Mary 20 minutes after 11 at night left column four rows down Mary Shelley was born Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in Somers Town London in 1797 She was the second child of the feminist philosopher educator and writer Mary Wollstonecraft and the first child of the philosopher novelist and journalist William Godwin Wollstonecraft died of puerperal fever shortly after Mary was born Godwin was left to bring up Mary along with her older halfsister Fanny Imlay Wollstonecrafts child by the American speculator Gilbert Imlay 4 A year after Wollstonecrafts death Godwin published his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman 1798 which he intended as a sincere and compassionate tribute However because the Memoirs revealed Wollstonecrafts affairs and her illegitimate child they were seen as shocking Mary Godwin read these memoirs and her mothers books and was brought up to cherish her mothers memory 5 Marys earliest years were happy judging from the letters of William Godwins housekeeper and nurse Louisa Jones 6 But Godwin was often deeply in debt feeling that he could not raise the children by himself he cast about for a second wife 7 In December 1801 he married Mary Jane Clairmont a welleducated woman with two young children of her ownCharles and Claire note 1 Most of Godwins friends disliked his new wife describing her as quicktempered and quarrelsome 8 note 2 but Godwin was devoted to her and the marriage was a success 9 Mary Godwin on the other hand came to detest her stepmother 2 William Godwins 19thcentury biographer Charles Kegan Paul later suggested that Mrs Godwin had favoured her own children over those of Mary Wollstonecraft 3 Together the Godwins started a publishing firm called M J Godwin which sold childrens books as well as stationery maps and games However the business did not turn a profit and Godwin was forced to borrow substantial sums to keep it going 10 He continued to borrow to pay off earlier loans compounding his problems By 1809 Godwins business was close to failure and he was near to despair 11 Godwin was saved from debtors prison by philosophical devotees such as Francis Place who lent him further money 12 The Polygon at left in Somers Town London between Camden Town and St Pancras where Mary Godwin was born and spent her earliest years Though Mary Godwin received little formal education her father tutored her in a broad range of subjects He often took the children on educational outings and they had access to his library and to the many intellectuals who visited him including the Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the former vicepresident of the United States Aaron Burr 13 Godwin admitted he was not educating the children according to Mary Wollstonecrafts philosophy as outlined in works such as A Vindication of the Rights of Woman 1792 but Mary Godwin nonetheless received an unusual and advanced education for a girl of the time She had a governess a daily tutor and read many of her fathers childrens books on Roman and Greek history in manuscript 14 For six months in 1811 she also attended a boarding school in Ramsgate 15 Her father described her at age 15 as singularly bold somewhat imperious and active of mind Her desire of knowledge is great and her perseverance in everything she undertakes almost invincible 16 In June 1812 Marys father sent her to stay with the dissenting family of the radical William Baxter near Dundee Scotland 17 To Baxter he wrote I am anxious that she should be brought uplike a philosopher even like a cynic 18 Scholars have speculated that she may have been sent away for her health to remove her from the seamy side of business or to introduce her to radical politics 19 Mary Godwin revelled in the spacious surroundings of Baxters house and in the companionship of his four daughters and she returned north in the summer of 1813 for a further stay of 10 months 20 In the 1831 introduction to Frankenstein she recalled I wrote thenbut in a most commonplace style It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to our house or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near that my true compositions the airy flights of my imagination were born and fostered 21 Percy Bysshe Shelley On 26 June 1814 Mary Godwin declared her love for Percy Shelley at Mary Wollstonecrafts graveside in the cemetery of St Pancras Old Church shown here in 1815 22 Mary Godwin may have first met the radical poetphilosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley in the interval between her two stays in Scotland 23 By the time she returned home for a second time on 30 March 1814 Percy Shelley had become estranged from his wife and was regularly visiting Godwin whom he had agreed to bail out of debt 24 Percy Shelleys radicalism particularly his economic views which he had imbibed from William Godwins Political Justice 1793 had alienated him from his wealthy aristocratic family they wanted him to follow traditional models of the landed aristocracy and he wanted to donate large amounts of the familys money to schemes intended to help the disadvantaged Percy Shelley therefore had difficulty gaining access to money until he inherited his estate because his family did not want him wasting it on projects of political justice After several months of promises Shelley announced that he either could not or would not pay off all of Godwins debts Godwin was angry and felt betrayed 25 Mary and Percy began meeting each other secretly at Mary Wollstonecraft s grave in St Pancras Churchyard and they fell in loveshe was nearly 17 he nearly 22 26 On 26 June 1814 Shelley and Godwin declared their love for one another as Shelley announced he could not hide his ardent passion leading her in a sublime and rapturous moment to say she felt the same way on either that day or the next Godwin lost her virginity to Shelley which tradition claims happened in the cemetery 27 Godwin described herself as attracted to Shelleys wild intellectual unearthly looks 28 To Marys dismay her father disapproved and tried to thwart the relationship and salvage the spotless fame of his daughter At about the same time Marys father learned of Shelleys inability to pay off the fathers debts 29 Mary who later wrote of my excessive and romantic attachment to my father 30 was confused She saw Percy Shelley as an embodiment of her parents liberal and reformist ideas of the 1790s particularly Godwins view that marriage was a repressive monopoly which he had argued in his 1793 edition of Political Justice but since retracted 31 On 28 July 1814 the couple eloped and secretly left for France taking Marys stepsister Claire Clairmont with them 32 but leaving Percys pregnant wife behind After convincing Mary Jane Godwin who had pursued them to Calais that they did not wish to return the trio travelled to Paris and then by donkey mule carriage and foot through a France recently ravaged by war to Switzerland It was acting in a novel being an incarnate romance Mary Shelley recalled in 1826 33 Godwin wrote about France in 1814 The distress of the inhabitants whose houses had been burned their cattle killed and all their wealth destroyed has given a sting to my detestation of war 34 As they travelled Mary and Percy read works by Mary Wollstonecraft and others kept a joint journal and continued their own writing 35 At Lucerne lack of money forced the three to turn back They travelled down the Rhine and by land to the Dutch port of Marsluys arriving at Gravesend Kent on 13 September 1814 36 Percy Bysshe Shelley was inspired by the radicalism of Godwins Political Justice 1793 When the poet Robert Southey met Shelley he felt as if he were seeing himself from the 1790s 37 Portrait by Amelia Curran 1819 The situation awaiting Mary Godwin in England was fraught with complications some of which she had not foreseen Either before or during the journey she had become pregnant She and Percy now found themselves penniless and to Marys genuine surprise her father refused to have anything to do with her 38 The couple moved with Claire into lodgings at Somers Town and later Nelson Square They maintained their intense programme of reading and writing and entertained Percy Shelleys friends such as Thomas Jefferson Hogg and the writer Thomas Love Peacock 39 Percy Shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors 40 The couples distraught letters reveal their pain at these separations 41 Pregnant and often ill Mary Godwin had to cope with Percys joy at the birth of his son by Harriet Shelley in late 1814 and his constant outings with Claire Clairmont note 3 Shelley and Clairmont were almost certainly lovers which caused much jealousy on Godwins part 42 Shelley greatly offended Godwin at one point when during a walk in the French countryside he suggested that they both take the plunge into a stream naked as it offended her principles 43 She was partly consoled by the visits of Hogg whom she disliked at first but soon considered a close friend 44 Percy Shelley seems to have wanted Mary Godwin and Hogg to become lovers 45 Mary did not dismiss the idea since in principle she believed in free love 46 In practice however she loved only Percy Shelley and seems to have ventured no further than flirting with Hogg 47 note 4 On 22 February 1815 she gave birth to a twomonths premature baby girl who was not expected to survive 48 On 6 March she wrote to Hogg My dearest Hogg my baby is deadwill you come to see me as soon as you can I wish to see youIt was perfectly well when I went to bedI awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that I would not awake it It was dead then but we did not find that out till morningfrom its appearance it evidently died of convulsionsWill you comeyou are so calm a creature Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milkfor I am no longer a mother now 49 The loss of her child induced acute depression in Mary Godwin who was haunted by visions of the baby but she conceived again and had recovered by the summer 50 With a revival in Percy Shelleys finances after the death of his grandfather Sir Bysshe Shelley the couple holidayed in Torquay and then rented a twostorey cottage at Bishopsgate on the edge of Windsor Great Park 51 Little is known about this period in Mary Godwins life since her journal from May 1815 to July 1816 is lost At Bishopsgate Percy wrote his poem Alastor or The Spirit of Solitude and on 24 January 1816 Mary gave birth to a second child William named after her father and soon nicknamed Willmouse In her novel The Last Man she later imagined Windsor as a Garden of Eden 52 Lake Geneva and Frankenstein Draft of Frankenstein It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld my man completed In May 1816 Mary Godwin Percy Shelley and their son travelled to Geneva with Claire Clairmont They planned to spend the summer with the poet Lord Byron whose recent affair with Claire had left her pregnant 53 The party arrived at Geneva on 14 May 1816 where Mary called herself Mrs Shelley Byron joined them on 25 May with his young physician John William Polidori 54 and rented the Villa Diodati close to Lake Geneva at the village of Cologny Percy Shelley rented a smaller building called Maison Chapuis on the waterfront nearby 55 They spent their time writing boating on the lake and talking late into the night 56 It proved a wet ungenial summer Mary Shelley remembered in 1831 and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house 57 note 5 Sitting around a log fire at Byrons villa the company amused themselves with German ghost stories which prompted Byron to propose that they each write a ghost story 58 59 Unable to think of a story young Mary Godwin became anxious Have you thought of a story I was asked each morning and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative 60 During one midJune evening the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life Perhaps a corpse would be reanimated Mary noted galvanism had given token of such things 61 It was after midnight before they retired and unable to sleep she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the grim terrors of her waking dream her ghost story 62 mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote

stretched out and then on the working of some powerful engine show signs of life and stir with an uneasy half vital motion Frightful must it be for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world 63 note 6 She began writing what she assumed would be a short story With Percy Shelleys encouragement she expanded this tale into her first novel Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus published in 1818 64 She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment when I first stepped out from childhood into life 54 The story of the writing of Frankenstein has been fictionalised several times and formed the basis for a number of films In September 2011 the astronomer Donald Olson after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars concluded that her waking dream took place between 2am and 3am 16 June 1816 several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story 65 Authorship of Frankenstein Shelley and her husband collaborated on the story but the extent of Percys contribution to the novel is unknown and has been argued over by readers and critics 66 There are differences in the 1818 1823 and 1831 editions and Mary Shelley wrote I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident nor scarcely of one train of feeling to my husband and yet but for his incitement it would never have taken the form in which it was presented to the world She wrote that the preface to the first edition was Percys work as far as I can recollect James Rieger concluded Percys assistance at every point in the books manufacture was so extensive that one hardly knows whether to regard him as editor or minor collaborator while Anne K Mellor later argued Percy only made many technical corrections and several times clarified the narrative and thematic continuity of the text 67 Charles E Robinson editor of a facsimile edition of the Frankenstein manuscripts concluded that Percys contributions to the book were no more than what most publishers editors have provided new or old authors or in fact what colleagues have provided to each other after reading each others works in progress 68 Bath and Marlow On their return to England in September Mary and Percy movedwith Claire Clairmont who took lodgings nearbyto Bath where they hoped to keep Claires pregnancy secret 69 At Cologny Mary Godwin had received two letters from her halfsister Fanny Imlay who alluded to her unhappy life on 9 October Fanny wrote an alarming letter from Bristol that sent Percy Shelley racing off to search for her without success On the morning of 10 October Fanny Imlay was found dead in a room at a Swansea inn along with a suicide note and a laudanum bottle On 10 December Percy Shelleys wife Harriet was discovered drowned in the Serpentine a lake in Hyde Park London 70 Both suicides were hushed up Harriets family obstructed Percy Shelleys effortsfully supported by Mary Godwinto assume custody of his two children by Harriet His lawyers advised him to improve his case by marrying so he and Mary who was pregnant again married on 30 December 1816 at St Mildreds Church Bread Street London 71 Mr and Mrs Godwin were present and the marriage ended the family rift 72 Claire Clairmont gave birth to a baby girl on 13 January at first called Alba later Allegra 73 note 7 In March of that year the Chancery Court ruled Percy Shelley morally unfit to assume custody of his children and later placed them with a clergymans family 74 Also in March the Shelleys moved with Claire and Alba to Albion House at Marlow Buckinghamshire a large damp building on the river Thames There Mary Shelley gave birth to her third child Clara on 2 September At Marlow they entertained their new friends Marianne and Leigh Hunt worked hard at their writing and often discussed politics 66 Early in the summer of 1817 Mary Shelley finished Frankenstein which was published anonymously in January 1818 Reviewers and readers assumed that Percy Shelley was the author since the book was published with his preface and dedicated to his political hero William Godwin 75 At Marlow Mary edited the joint journal of the groups 1814 Continental journey adding material written in Switzerland in 1816 along with Percys poem Mont Blanc The result was the History of a Six Weeks Tour published in November 1817 That autumn Percy Shelley often lived away from home in London to evade creditors The threat of a debtors prison combined with their ill health and fears of losing custody of their children contributed to the couples decision to leave England for Italy on 12 March 1818 taking Claire Clairmont and Alba with them 76 They had no intention of returning 77 Italy William Willmouse Shelley painted just before his death from malaria in 1819 portrait by Amelia Curran 1819 One of the partys first tasks on arriving in Italy was to hand Alba over to Byron who was living in Venice He had agreed to raise her so long as Claire had nothing more to do with her 78 The Shelleys then embarked on a roving existence never settling in any one place for long 79 note 8 Along the way they accumulated a circle of friends and acquaintances who often moved with them The couple devoted their time to writing reading learning sightseeing and socialising The Italian adventure was however blighted for Mary Shelley by the deaths of both her childrenClara in September 1818 in Venice and William in June 1819 in Rome 80 note 9 These losses left her in a deep depression that isolated her from Percy Shelley 81 who wrote in his notebook My dearest Mary wherefore hast thou gone And left me in this dreary world alone Thy form is here indeeda lovely one But thou art fled gone down a dreary road That leads to Sorrows most obscure abode For thine own sake I cannot follow thee Do thou return for mine 82 For a time Mary Shelley found comfort only in her writing 83 The birth of her fourth child Percy Florence on 12 November 1819 finally lifted her spirits 84 though she nursed the memory of her lost children till the end of her life 85 Italy provided the Shelleys Byron and other exiles with a political freedom unattainable at home Despite its associations with personal loss Italy became for Mary Shelley a country which memory painted as paradise 86 Their Italian years were a time of intense intellectual and creative activity for both Shelleys While Percy composed a series of major poems Mary wrote the novel Matilda 87 the historical novel Valperga and the plays Proserpine and Midas Mary wrote Valperga to help alleviate her fathers financial difficulties as Percy refused to assist him further 88 She was often physically ill however and prone to depressions She also had to cope with Percys interest in other women such as Sophia Stacey Emilia Viviani and Jane Williams 89 Since Mary Shelley shared his belief in the nonexclusivity of marriage she formed emotional ties of her own among the men and women of their circle She became particularly fond of the Greek revolutionary Prince Alexandros Mavrokordatos and of Jane and Edward Williams 90 note 10 In December 1818 the Shelleys travelled south with Claire Clairmont and their servants to Naples where they stayed for three months receiving only one visitor a physician 91 In 1820 they found themselves plagued by accusations and threats from Paolo and Elise Foggi former servants whom Percy Shelley had dismissed in Naples shortly after the Foggis had married 92 The pair revealed that on 27 February 1819 in Naples Percy Shelley had registered as his child by Mary Shelley a twomonthold baby girl named Elena Adelaide Shelley 93 The Foggis also claimed that Claire Clairmont was the babys mother 94 Biographers have offered various interpretations of these events that Percy Shelley decided to adopt a local child that the baby was his by Elise Claire or an unknown woman or that she was Elises by Byron 95 note 11 Mary Shelley insisted she would have known if Claire had been pregnant but it is unclear how much she really knew 96 The events in Naples a city Mary Shelley later called a paradise inhabited by devils 97 remain shrouded in mystery note 12 The only certainty is that she herself was not the childs mother 97 Elena Adelaide Shelley died in Naples on 9 June 1820 98 After leaving Naples the Shelleys settled in Rome the city where her husband wrote where the meanest streets were strewed with truncated columns broken capitalsand sparkling fragments of granite or porphyryThe voice of dead time in still vibrations is breathed from these dumb things animated and glorified as they were by man 99 Rome inspired her to begin writing the unfinished novel Valerius the Reanimated Roman where the eponymous hero resists the decay of Rome and the machinations of superstitious Catholicism 99 The writing of her novel was broken off when her son William died of malaria 99 Shelley bitterly commented that she had come to Italy to improve her husbands health and instead the Italian climate had just killed her two children leading her to write May you my dear Marianne never know what it is to lose two only and lovely children in one yearto watch their dying momentsand then at last to be left childless and forever miserable 100 To deal with her grief Shelley wrote the novella The Fields of Fancy which became Matilda dealing with a young woman whose beauty inspired incestuous love in her father who ultimately commits suicide to stop himself from acting on his passion for his daughter while she spends the rest of her life full of despair about the unnatural love I had inspired 101 The novella offered a feminist critique of a patriarchal society as Matilda is punished in the afterlife though she did nothing to encourage her fathers feelings 102 Claire Clairmont Marys stepsister and mistress of Lord Byron portrait by Amelia Curran 1819 In the summer of 1822 a pregnant Mary moved with Percy Claire and Edward and Jane Williams to the isolated Villa Magni at the seas edge near the hamlet of San Terenzo in the Bay of Lerici Once they were settled in Percy broke the evil news to Claire that her daughter Allegra had died of typhus in a convent at Bagnacavallo 103 Mary Shelley was distracted and unhappy in the cramped and remote Villa Magni which she came to regard as a dungeon 104 On 16 June she miscarried losing so much blood that she nearly died Rather than wait for a doctor Percy sat her in a bath of ice to staunch the bleeding an act the doctor later told him saved her life 105 All was not well between the couple that summer however and Percy spent more time with Jane Williams than with his depressed and debilitated wife 106 Most of the short poems Shelley wrote at San Terenzo were addressed to Jane rather than to Mary The coast offered Percy Shelley and Edward Williams the chance to enjoy their perfect plaything for the summer a new sailing boat 107 The boat had been designed by Daniel Roberts and Edward Trelawny an admirer of Byrons who had joined the party in January 1822 108 On 1 July 1822 Percy Shelley Edward Ellerker Williams and Captain Daniel Roberts sailed south down the coast to Livorno There Percy Shelley discussed with Byron and Leigh Hunt the launch of a radical magazine called The Liberal 109 On 8 July he and Edward Williams set out on the return journey to Lerici with their eighteenyearold boatboy Charles Vivian 110 They never reached their destination A letter arrived at Villa Magni from Hunt to Percy Shelley dated 8 July saying pray write to tell us how you got home for they say you had bad weather after you sailed monday we are anxious 111 The paper fell from me Mary told a friend later I trembled all over 111 She and Jane Williams rushed desperately to Livorno and then to Pisa in the fading hope that their husbands were still alive Ten days after the storm three bodies washed up on the coast near Viareggio midway between Livorno and Lerici Trelawny Byron and Hunt cremated Percy Shelleys corpse on the beach at Viareggio 112 Return to England and

are now five and twenty And most fortunately you have pursued a course of reading and cultivated your mind in a manner the most admirably adapted to make you a great and successful author If you cannot be independent who should be William Godwin to Mary Shelley 113 After her husbands death Mary Shelley lived for a year with Leigh Hunt and his family in Genoa where she often saw Byron and transcribed his poems She resolved to live by her pen and for her son but her financial situation was precarious On 23 July 1823 she left Genoa for England and stayed with her father and stepmother in the Strand until a small advance from her fatherinlaw enabled her to lodge nearby 114 Sir Timothy Shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson Percy Florence only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian Mary Shelley rejected this idea instantly 115 She managed instead to wring out of Sir Timothy a limited annual allowance which she had to repay when Percy Florence inherited the estate but to the end of his days he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers Mary Shelley busied herself with editing her husbands poems among other literary endeavours but concern for her son restricted her options Sir Timothy threatened to stop the allowance if any biography of the poet were published 116 In 1826 Percy Florence became the legal heir of the Shelley estate after the death of his halfbrother Charles Shelley his fathers son by Harriet Shelley Sir Timothy raised Marys allowance from 100 a year to 250 but remained as difficult as ever 117 Mary Shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of William Godwins circle but poverty prevented her from socialising as she wished She also felt ostracised by those who like Sir Timothy still disapproved of her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley 118 In the summer of 1824 Mary Shelley moved to Kentish Town in north London to be near Jane Williams She may have been in the words of her biographer Muriel Spark a little in love with Jane Jane later disillusioned her by gossiping that Percy had preferred her to Mary owing to Marys inadequacy as a wife 119 At around this time Mary Shelley was working on her novel The Last Man 1826 and she assisted a series of friends who were writing memoirs of Byron and Percy Shelleythe beginnings of her attempts to immortalise her husband 120 She also met the American actor John Howard Payne and the American writer Washington Irving who intrigued her Payne fell in love with her and in 1826 asked her to marry him She refused saying that after being married to one genius she could only marry another 121 Payne accepted the rejection and tried without success to talk his friend Irving into proposing himself Mary Shelley was aware of Paynes plan but how seriously she took it is unclear 122 Reginald Eastons miniature of Mary Shelley is allegedly drawn from her death mask c1857 123 In 1827 Mary Shelley was party to a scheme that enabled her friend Isabel Robinson and Isabels lover Mary Diana Dods who wrote under the name David Lyndsay to embark on a life together in France as man and wife 124 note 13 With the help of Payne whom she kept in the dark about the details Mary Shelley obtained false passports for the couple 125 In 1828 she fell ill with smallpox while visiting them in Paris Weeks later she recovered unscarred but without her youthful beauty 126 During the period 182740 Mary Shelley was busy as an editor and writer She wrote the novels The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck 1830 Lodore 1835 and Falkner 1837 She contributed five volumes of Lives of Italian Spanish Portuguese and French authors to Lardners Cabinet Cyclopaedia She also wrote stories for ladies magazines She was still helping to support her father and they looked out for publishers for each other 127 In 1830 she sold the copyright for a new edition of Frankenstein for 60 to Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley for their new Standard Novels series 128 After her fathers death in 1836 at the age of eighty she began assembling his letters and a memoir for publication as he had requested in his will but after two years of work she abandoned the project 129 Throughout this period she also championed Percy Shelleys poetry promoting its publication and quoting it in her writing By 1837 Percys works were wellknown and increasingly admired 130 In the summer of 1838 Edward Moxon the publisher of Tennyson and the soninlaw of Charles Lamb proposed publishing a collected works of Percy Shelley Mary was paid 500 to edit the Poetical Works 1838 which Sir Timothy insisted should not include a biography Mary found a way to tell the story of Percys life nonetheless she included extensive biographical notes about the poems 131 Shelley continued to practice her mothers feminist principles by extending aid to women whom society disapproved of 132 For instance Shelley extended financial aid to Mary Diana Dods a single mother and illegitimate herself who appears to have been a lesbian and gave her the new identity of Walter Sholto Douglas husband of her lover Isabel Robinson 132 Shelley also assisted Georgiana Paul a woman disallowed for by her husband for alleged adultery 133 Shelley in her diary about her assistance to the latter I do not make a boastI do not say aloudbehold my generosity and greatness of mindfor in truth it is simple justice I performand so I am still reviled for being worldly 133 Mary Shelley continued to treat potential romantic partners with caution In 1828 she met and flirted with the French writer Prosper Mérimée but her one surviving letter to him appears to be a deflection of his declaration of love 134 She was delighted when her old friend from Italy Edward Trelawny returned to England and they joked about marriage in their letters 135 Their friendship had altered however following her refusal to cooperate with his proposed biography of Percy Shelley and he later reacted angrily to her omission of the atheistic section of Queen Mab from Percy Shelleys poems 136 Oblique references in her journals from the early 1830s until the early 1840s suggest that Mary Shelley had feelings for the radical politician Aubrey Beauclerk who may have disappointed her by twice marrying others 137 note 14 Mary Shelleys first concern during these years was the welfare of Percy Florence She honoured her late husbands wish that his son attend public school and with Sir Timothys grudging help had him educated at Harrow To avoid boarding fees she moved to Harrow on the Hill herself so that Percy could attend as a day scholar 138 Though Percy went on to Trinity College Cambridge and dabbled in politics and the law he showed no sign of his parents gifts 139 He was devoted to his mother and after he left university in 1841 he came to live with her Final years and death In 1840 and 1842 mother and son travelled together on the continent journeys that Mary Shelley recorded in Rambles in Germany and Italy in 1840 1842 and 1843 1844 140 In 1844 Sir Timothy Shelley finally died at the age of ninety falling from the stalk like an overblown flower as Mary put it 141 For the first time she and her son were financially independent though the estate proved less valuable than they had hoped 142 In order to fulfil Mary Shelleys wishes Percy Florence and his wife Jane had the coffins of Mary Shelleys parents exhumed and buried with her in Bournemouth 143 In the mid1840s Mary Shelley found herself the target of three separate blackmailers In 1845 an Italian political exile called Gatteschi whom she had met in Paris threatened to publish letters she had sent him A friend of her sons bribed a police chief into seizing Gatteschis papers including the letters which were then destroyed 144 Shortly afterwards Mary Shelley bought some letters written by herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley from a man calling himself G Byron and posing as the illegitimate son of the late Lord Byron 145 Also in 1845 Percy Bysshe Shelleys cousin Thomas Medwin approached her claiming to have written a damaging biography of Percy Shelley He said he would suppress it in return for 250 but Mary Shelley refused 146 note 15 In 1848 Percy Florence married Jane Gibson St John The marriage proved a happy one and Mary Shelley and Jane were fond of each other 147 Mary lived with her son and daughterinlaw at Field Place Sussex the Shelleys ancestral home and at Chester Square London and accompanied them on travels abroad Mary Shelleys last years were blighted by illness From 1839 she suffered from headaches and bouts of paralysis in parts of her body which sometimes prevented her from reading and writing 148 On 1 February 1851 at Chester Square she died at the age of fiftythree from what her physician suspected was a brain tumour According to Jane Shelley Mary Shelley had asked to be buried with her mother and father but Percy and Jane judging the graveyard at St Pancras to be dreadful chose to bury her instead at St Peters Church Bournemouth near their new home at Boscombe 149 On the first anniversary of Mary Shelleys death the Shelleys opened her boxdesk Inside they found locks of her dead childrens hair a notebook she had shared with Percy Bysshe Shelley and a copy of his poem Adonaïs with one page folded round a silk parcel containing some of his ashes and the remains of his heart 85 Literary themes and styles Mary Shelley lived a literary life Her father encouraged her to learn to write by composing letters 150 and her favourite occupation as a child was writing stories 151 Unfortunately all of Marys juvenilia were lost when she ran off with Percy in 1814 and none of her surviving manuscripts can be definitively dated before that year 152 Her first published work is often thought to have been Mounseer Nongtongpaw 153 comic verses written for Godwins Juvenile Library when she was ten and a half however the poem is attributed to another writer in the most recent authoritative collection of her works 154 Percy Shelley enthusiastically encouraged Mary Shelleys writing My husband was from the first very anxious that I should prove myself worthy of my parentage and enrol myself on the page of fame He was forever inciting me to obtain literary reputation 155 Novels Autobiographical elements Certain sections of Mary Shelleys novels are often interpreted as masked rewritings of her life Critics have pointed to the recurrence of the fatherdaughter motif in particular as evidence of this autobiographical style 156 For example commentators frequently read Mathilda 1820 autobiographically identifying the three central characters as versions of Mary Shelley William Godwin and Percy Shelley 157 Mary Shelley herself confided that she modelled the central characters of The Last Man on her Italian circle Lord Raymond who leaves England to fight for the Greeks and dies in Constantinople is based on Lord Byron and the utopian Adrian Earl of Windsor who leads his followers in search of a natural paradise and dies when his boat sinks in a storm is a fictional portrait of Percy Bysshe Shelley 158 However as she wrote in her review of Godwins novel Cloudesley 1830 she did not believe that authors were merely copying from our own hearts 159 William Godwin regarded his daughters characters as types rather than portraits from real life 160 Some modern critics such as Patricia Clemit and Jane Blumberg have taken the same view resisting autobiographical readings of Mary Shelleys works 161 Novelistic genres Euthanasia was never heard of more even her name perishedThe private chronicles from which the foregoing relation has been collected end with the death of Euthanasia It is therefore in public histories alone that we find an account of the last years of the life of Castruccio From Mary Shelley Valperga 162 Mary Shelley employed the techniques of many different novelistic genres most vividly the Godwinian novel Walter Scotts new historical novel and the Gothic novel The Godwinian novel made popular during the 1790s with works such as Godwins Caleb Williams 1794 employed a Rousseauvian confessional form to explore the contradictory relations between the self and society 163 and Frankenstein exhibits many of the same themes and literary devices as Godwins novel 164 However Shelley critiques those Enlightenment ideals that Godwin promotes in his works 165 In The Last Man she uses the philosophical form of the Godwinian novel to demonstrate the ultimate meaninglessness of the world 166 While earlier Godwinian novels had shown how rational individuals could slowly improve society The Last Man and Frankenstein demonstrate the individuals lack of control over history 167 Shelley uses the historical novel to comment on gender relations for example Valperga is a feminist version of Scotts masculinist genre 168 Introducing women into the story who are not part of the historical record Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions 169 Shelley sets the male protagonists compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative reason and sensibility 170 In Perkin Warbeck Shelleys other historical novel Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship domesticity and equality Through her Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events 171 Gender With the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1970s Mary Shelleys works particularly Frankenstein began to attract much more attention from scholars Feminist and psychoanalytic critics were largely responsible for the recovery from neglect of Shelley as a writer 172 Ellen Moers was one of the first to claim that Shelleys loss of a baby was a crucial influence on the writing of Frankenstein 173 She argues that the novel is a birth myth in which Shelley comes to terms with her guilt for causing her mothers death as well as for failing as a parent 174 Shelley scholar Anne K Mellor suggests that from a feminist viewpoint it is a story about what happens when a man tries to have a baby without a woman Frankenstein is profoundly concerned with natural as opposed to unnatural modes of production and reproduction 175 Victor Frankensteins failure as a parent in the novel has been read as an expression of the anxieties which accompany pregnancy giving birth and particularly maternity 176 Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar argue in their seminal book The Madwoman in the Attic 1979 that in Frankenstein in particular Shelley responded to the masculine literary tradition represented by John Miltons Paradise Lost In their interpretation Shelley reaffirms this masculine tradition including the misogyny inherent in it but at the same time conceals fantasies of equality that occasionally erupt in monstrous images of rage 177 Mary Poovey reads the first edition of Frankenstein as part of a larger pattern in Shelleys writing which begins with literary selfassertion and ends with conventional femininity 178 Poovey suggests that Frankenstein s multiple narratives enable Shelley to split her artistic persona she can express and efface herself at the same time 179 Shelleys fear of selfassertion is reflected in the fate of Frankenstein who is punished for his egotism by losing all his domestic ties 180 Feminist critics often focus on how authorship itself particularly female authorship is represented in and through Shelleys novels 181 As Mellor explains Shelley uses the Gothic style not only to explore repressed female sexual desire 182 but also as way to censor her own speech in Frankenstein 183 According to Poovey and Mellor Shelley did not want to promote her own authorial persona and felt deeply inadequate as a writer and this shame contributed to the generation of her fictional images of abnormality perversion and destruction 184 Shelleys writings focus on the role of the family in society and womens role within that family She celebrates the feminine affections and compassion associated with the family and suggests that civil society will fail without them 185 Shelley was profoundly committed to an ethic of cooperation mutual dependence and selfsacrifice 186 In Lodore for example the central story follows the fortunes of the wife and daughter of the title character Lord Lodore who is killed in a duel at the end of the first volume leaving a trail of legal financial and familial obstacles for the two heroines to negotiate The novel is engaged with political and ideological issues particularly the education and social role of women 187 It dissects a patriarchal culture that separated the sexes and pressured women into dependence on men In the view of Shelley scholar Betty T Bennett the novel proposes egalitarian educational paradigms for women and men which would bring social justice as well as the spiritual and intellectual means by which to meet the challenges life invariably brings 188 However Falkner is the only one of Mary Shelleys novels in which the heroines agenda triumphs 189 The novels resolution proposes that when female values triumph over violent and destructive masculinity men will be freed to express the compassion sympathy and generosity of their better natures 190 Enlightenment and Romanticism Frankenstein like much Gothic fiction of the period mixes a visceral and alienating subject matter with speculative and thoughtprovoking themes 191 Rather than focusing on the twists and turns of the plot however the novel foregrounds the mental and moral struggles of the protagonist Victor Frankenstein and Shelley imbues the text with her own brand of politicised Romanticism one that criticised the individualism and egotism of traditional Romanticism 192 Victor Frankenstein is like Satan in Paradise Lost and Prometheus he rebels against tradition he creates life and he shapes his own destiny These traits are not portrayed positively as Blumberg writes his relentless ambition is a selfdelusion clothed as quest for truth 193 He must abandon his family to fulfill his ambition 194 The frontispiece to the 1831 Frankenstein by Theodor von Holst one of the first two illustrations for the novel 195 Mary Shelley believed in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos 196 In practice her works largely criticise the way 18thcentury thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about The creature in Frankenstein for example reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless 197 Shelleys works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft she lacks faith in Godwins theory that humanity could eventually be perfected 198 As literary scholar Kari Lokke writes The Last Man more so than Frankenstein in its refusal to place humanity at the center of the universe its questioning of our privileged position in relation to natureconstitutes a profound and prophetic challenge to Western humanism 199 Specifically Mary Shelleys allusions to what radicals believed was a failed revolution in France and the Godwinian Wollstonecraftian and Burkean responses to it challenge Enlightenment faith in the inevitability of progress through collective efforts 200 As in Frankenstein Shelley offers a profoundly disenchanted commentary on the age of revolution which ends in a total rejection of the progressive ideals of her own generation 201 Not only does she reject these Enlightenment political ideals but she also rejects the Romantic notion that the poetic or literary imagination can offer an alternative 202 Politics There is a new scholarly emphasis on Shelley as a lifelong reformer deeply engaged in the liberal and feminist concerns of her day 203 In 1820 she was thrilled by the Liberal uprising in Spain which forced the king to grant a constitution 204 In 1823 she wrote articles for Leigh Hunts periodical The Liberal and played an active role in the formulation of its outlook 205 She was delighted when the Whigs came back to power in 1830 and at the prospect of the 1832 Reform Act 206 Critics have until recently cited Lodore and Falkner as evidence of increasing conservatism in Mary Shelleys later works In 1984 Mary Poovey influentially identified the retreat of Mary Shelleys reformist politics into the separate sphere of the domestic 207 Poovey suggested that Mary Shelley wrote Falkner to resolve her conflicted response to her fathers combination of libertarian radicalism and stern insistence on social decorum 208 Mellor largely agreed arguing that Mary Shelley grounded her alternative political ideology on the metaphor of the peaceful loving bourgeois family She thereby implicitly endorsed a conservative vision of gradual evolutionary reform 209 This vision allowed women to participate in the public sphere but it inherited the inequalities inherent in the bourgeois family 210 However in the last decade or so this view has been challenged For example Bennett claims that Mary Shelleys works reveal a consistent commitment to Romantic idealism and political reform 211 and Jane Blumbergs study of Shelleys early novels argues that her career cannot be easily divided into radical and conservative halves She contends that Shelley was never a passionate radical like her husband and her later lifestyle was not abruptly assumed nor was it a betrayal She was in fact challenging the political and literary influences of her circle in her first work 212 In this reading Shelleys early works are interpreted as a challenge to Godwin and Percy Bysshe Shelleys radicalism Victor Frankensteins thoughtless rejection of family for example is seen as evidence of Shelleys constant concern for the domestic 213 Short stories Shelley frequently wrote stories to accompany prepared illustrations for gift books such as this one which accompanied Transformation in the 1830 The Keepsake 214 In the 1820s and 1830s Mary Shelley frequently wrote short stories for gift books or annuals including sixteen for The Keepsake which was aimed at middleclass women and bound in silk with gilt edged pages 215 Mary Shelleys work in this genre has been described as that of a hack writer and wordy and pedestrian 216 However critic Charlotte Sussman points out that other leading writers of the day such as the Romantic poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge also took advantage of this profitable market She explains that the annuals were a major mode of literary production in the 1820s and 1830s with The Keepsake the most successful 217 Many of Shelleys stories are set in places or times far removed from early 19thcentury Britain such as Greece and the reign of Henry IV of France Shelley was particularly interested in the fragility of individual identity and often depicted the way a persons role in the world can be cataclysmically altered either by an internal emotional upheaval or by some supernatural occurrence that mirrors an internal schism 218 In her stories female identity is tied to a womans shortlived value in the marriage market while male identity can be sustained and transformed through the use of money 219 Although Mary Shelley wrote twentyone short stories for the annuals between 1823 and 1839 she always saw herself above all as a novelist She wrote to Leigh Hunt I write bad articles which help to make me miserablebut I am going to plunge into a novel and hope that its clear water will wash off the mud of the magazines 220 Travelogues When they ran off to France in the summer of 1814 Mary Godwin and Percy Shelley began a joint journal 221 which they published in 1817 under the title History of a Six Weeks Tour adding four letters two by each of them based on their visit to Geneva in 1816 along with Percy Shelleys poem Mont Blanc The work celebrates youthful love and political idealism and consciously follows the example of Mary Wollstonecraft and others who had combined travelling with writing 222 The perspective of the History is philosophical and reformist rather than that of a conventional travelogue in particular it addresses the effects of politics and war on France 223 The letters the couple wrote on the second journey confront the great and extraordinary events of the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo after his Hundred Days return in 1815 They also explore the sublimity of Lake Geneva and Mont Blanc as well as the revolutionary legacy of the philosopher and novelist JeanJacques Rousseau 224 Mary Shelleys last fulllength book written in the form of letters and published in 1844 was Rambles in Germany and Italy in 1840 1842 and 1843 which recorded her travels with her son Percy Florence and his university friends In Rambles Shelley follows the tradition of Mary Wollstonecrafts Letters Written in Sweden Norway and Denmark and her own A History of a Six Weeks Tour in mapping her personal and political landscape through the discourse of sensibility and sympathy 225 For Shelley building sympathetic connections between people is the way to build civil society and to increase knowledge knowledge to enlighten and free the mind from clinging deadening prejudicesa wider circle of sympathy with our fellowcreaturesthese are the uses of travel 226 Between observations on scenery culture and the people especially in a political point of view 227 she uses the travelogue form to explore her roles as a widow and mother and to reflect on revolutionary nationalism in Italy 228 note 16 She also records her pilgrimage to scenes associated with Percy Shelley 229 According to critic Clarissa Orr Mary Shelleys adoption of a persona of philosophical motherhood gives Rambles the unity of a prose poem with death and memory as central themes 230 At the same time Shelley makes an egalitarian case against monarchy class distinctions slavery and war 231 Biographies Between 1832 and 1839 Mary Shelley wrote many biographies of notable Italian Spanish Portuguese and French men and a few women for Dionysius Lardners Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men These formed part of Lardners Cabinet Cyclopaedia one of the best of many such series produced in the 1820s and 1830s in response to growing middleclass demand for selfeducation 232 Until the republication of these essays in 2002 their significance within her body of work was not appreciated 233 note 17 In the view of literary scholar Greg Kucich they reveal Mary Shelleys prodigious research across several centuries and in multiple languages her gift for biographical narrative and her interest in the emerging forms of feminist historiography 234 Shelley wrote in a biographical style popularised by the 18thcentury critic Samuel Johnson in his Lives of the Poets 177981 combining secondary sources memoir and anecdote and authorial evaluation 235 She records details of each writers life and character quotes their writing in the original as well as in translation and ends with a critical assessment of their achievement 236 For Shelley biographical writing was supposed to in her words form as it were a school in which to study the philosophy of history 237 and to teach lessons Most frequently and importantly these lessons consisted of criticisms of maledominated institutions such as primogeniture 238 Shelley emphasises domesticity romance family sympathy and compassion in the lives of her subjects Her conviction that such forces could improve society connects her biographical approach with that of other early feminist historians such as Mary Hays and Anna Jameson 239 Unlike her novels most of which had an original print run of several hundred copies the Lives had a print run of about 4000 for each volume thus according to Kucich Mary Shelleys use of biography to forward the social agenda of womens historiography became one of her most influential political interventions 240 Editorial work The qualities that struck any one newly introduced to Shelley were first a gentle and cordial goodness that animated his intercourse with warm affection and helpful sympathy The other the eagerness and ardour with which he was attached to the cause of human happiness and improvement Mary Shelley Preface Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley 241 Soon after Percy Shelleys death Mary Shelley determined to write his biography In a letter of 17 November 1822 she announced I shall write his life thus occupy myself in the only manner from which I can derive consolation 242 However her fatherinlaw Sir Timothy Shelley effectively banned her from doing so 243 note 18 Mary began her fostering of Percys poetic reputation in 1824 with the publication of his Posthumous Poems In 1839 while she was working on the Lives she prepared a new edition of his poetry which became in the words of literary scholar Susan J Wolfson the canonizing event in the history of her husbands reputation 244 The following year Mary Shelley edited a volume of her husbands essays letters translations and fragments and throughout the 1830s she introduced his poetry to a wider audience by publishing assorted works in the annual The Keepsake 245 Evading Sir Timothys ban on a biography Mary Shelley often included in these editions her own annotations and reflections on her husbands life and work 246 I am to justify his ways she had declared in 1824 I am to make him beloved to all posterity 247 It was this goal argues Blumberg that led her to present Percys work to the public in the most popular form possible 248 To tailor his works for a Victorian audience she cast Percy Shelley as a lyrical rather than a political poet 249 As Mary Favret writes the disembodied Percy identifies the spirit of poetry itself 250 Mary glossed Percys political radicalism as a form of sentimentalism arguing that his republicanism arose from sympathy for those who were suffering 251 She inserted romantic anecdotes of his benevolence domesticity and love of the natural world 252 Portraying herself as Percys practical muse she also noted how she had suggested revisions as he wrote 253 Despite the emotions stirred by this task Mary Shelley arguably proved herself in many respects a professional and scholarly editor 254 Working from Percys messy sometimes indecipherable notebooks she attempted to form a chronology for his writings and she included poems such as Epipsychidion addressed to Emilia Viviani which she would rather have left out 255 She was forced however into several compromises and as Blumberg notes modern critics have found fault with the edition and claim variously that she miscopied misinterpreted purposely obscured and attempted to turn the poet into something he was not 256 According to Wolfson Donald Reiman a modern editor of Percy Bysshe Shelleys works still refers to Mary Shelleys editions while acknowledging that her editing style belongs to an age of editing when the aim was not to establish accurate texts and scholarly apparatus but to present a full record of a writers career for the general reader 257 In principle Mary Shelley believed in publishing every last word of her husbands work 258 but she found herself obliged to omit certain passages either by pressure from her publisher Edward Moxon or in deference to public propriety 259 For example she removed the atheistic passages from Queen Mab for the first edition After she restored them in the second edition Moxon was prosecuted and convicted of blasphemous libel though the prosecution was brought out of principle by the Chartist publisher Henry Hetherington and no punishment was sought 260 Mary Shelleys omissions provoked criticism often stinging from members of Percy Shelleys former circle 261 and reviewers accused her of among other things indiscriminate inclusions 262 Her notes have nevertheless remained an essential source for the study of Percy Shelleys work As Bennett explains biographers and critics agree that Mary Shelleys commitment to bring Shelley the notice she believed his works merited was the single major force that established Shelleys reputation during a period when he almost certainly would have faded from public view 263 Reputation Engraving by George Stodart after a monument of Mary and Percy Shelley by Henry Weekes 1853 In her own lifetime Mary Shelley was taken seriously as a writer though reviewers often missed her writings political edge After her death however she was chiefly remembered as the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley and as the author of Frankenstein 264 In fact in the introduction to her letters published in 1945 editor Frederick Jones wrote a collection of the present size could not be justified by the general quality of the letters or by Mary Shelleys importance as a writer It is as the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley that she excites our interest 265 This attitude had not disappeared by 1980 when Betty T Bennett published the first volume of Mary Shelleys complete letters As she explains the fact is that until recent years scholars have generally regarded Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley as a result William Godwins and Mary Wollstonecrafts daughter who became Shelleys Pygmalion 266 It was not until Emily Sunsteins Mary Shelley Romance and Reality in 1989 that a fulllength scholarly biography was published 267 The attempts of Mary Shelleys son and daughterinlaw to Victorianise her memory by censoring biographical documents contributed to a perception of Mary Shelley as a more conventional less reformist figure than her works suggest Her own timid omissions from Percy Shelleys works and her quiet avoidance of public controversy in her later years added to this impression Commentary by Hogg Trelawny and other admirers of Percy Shelley also tended to downplay Mary Shelleys radicalism Trelawnys Records of Shelley Byron and the Author 1878 praised Percy Shelley at the expense of Mary questioning her intelligence and even her authorship of Frankenstein 268 Lady Shelley Percy Florences wife responded in part by presenting a severely edited collection of letters she had inherited published privately as Shelley and Mary in 1882 269 From Frankenstein s first theatrical adaptation in 1823 to the cinematic adaptations of the 20th century including the first cinematic version in 1910 and nowfamous versions such as James Whales 1931 Frankenstein Mel Brooks 1974 Young Frankenstein and Kenneth Branaghs 1994 Mary Shelleys Frankenstein many audiences first encounter the work of Mary Shelley through adaptation 270 Over the course of the 19th century Mary Shelley came to be seen as a onenovel author at best rather than as the professional writer she was most of her works have remained out of print until the last thirty years obstructing a larger view of her achievement 271 In recent decades the republication of almost all her writing has stimulated a new recognition of its value Her habit of intensive reading and study revealed in her journals and letters and reflected in her works is now better appreciated 272 Shelleys conception of herself as an author has also been recognised after Percys death she wrote of her authorial ambitions I think that I can maintain myself and there is something inspiriting in the idea 273 Scholars now consider Mary Shelley to be a major Romantic figure significant for her literary achievement and her political voice as a woman and a liberal 269 Selected works Main article List of works by Mary Shelley History of a Six Weeks Tour 1817 Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus 1818 Mathilda 1819 Valperga or The Life and Adventures of
