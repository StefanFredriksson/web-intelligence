design description IEEE 1016 SPM Software project management IEEE 1058 SUD Software user documentation IEEE 1063 v t e Software quality assurance SQA is a means of monitoring the software engineering processes and methods used to ensure proper quality This is accomplished by many and varied approaches It may include ensuring conformance to one or more standards such as ISO 9000 or a model such as CMMI 1 It includes standards and procedures that administrators may use to review and audit software products and activities to verify that the software meets standards According to ISOIEC 15504 v25 SPICE it is a supporting process that provides the independent assurance that all work products activities and processes comply with the predefined plans and ISO 15504 citation needed SQA encompasses the entire software development process including requirements definition software design coding code reviews source code control software configuration management testing release management and product integration It is organized into goals commitments abilities activities measurements and verification 2 Contents 1 Purpose 2 Activities 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Purpose edit
