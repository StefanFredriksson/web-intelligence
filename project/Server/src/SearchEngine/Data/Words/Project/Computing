In a general way we can define computing to mean any goaloriented activity requiring benefiting from or creating computers Thus computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes processing structuring and managing various kinds of information doing scientific studies using computers making computer systems behave intelligently creating and using communications and entertainment media finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose and so on The list is virtually endless and the possibilities are vast ACM also defines five subdisciplines of the computing field 2 Computer engineering Computer science Information systems Information technology Software engineering However Computing Curricula 2005 1 also recognizes that the meaning of computing depends on the context Computing also has other meanings that are more specific based on the context in which the term is used For example an information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from a software engineer Regardless of the context doing computing well can be complicated and difficult Because society needs people to do computing well we must think of computing not only as a profession but also as a discipline The term computing has sometimes been narrowly defined as in a 1989 ACM report on Computing as a Discipline 3 The discipline of computing is the systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information their theory analysis design efficiency implementation and application The fundamental question underlying all computing is What can be efficiently automated The term computing is also synonymous with counting and calculating In earlier times it was used in reference to the action performed by mechanical computing machines and before that to human computers 4 History edit Main articles History of computing and Timeline of computing The history of computing is longer than the history of computing hardware and modern computing technology and includes the history of methods intended for pen and paper or for chalk and slate with or without the aid of tables Computing is intimately tied to the representation of numbers But long before abstractions like the number arose there were mathematical concepts to serve the purposes of civilization clarification needed These concepts include onetoone correspondence the basis of counting comparison to a standard used for measurement and the 345 right triangle a device for assuring a right angle The earliest known tool for use in computation was the abacus and it was thought to have been invented in Babylon circa 2400 BC Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles Abaci of a more modern design are still used as calculation tools today This was the first known calculation aid preceding Greek methods by 2000 years citation needed The first recorded idea of using digital electronics for computing was the 1931 paper The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena by C E WynnWilliams 5 Claude Shannon s 1938 paper A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits then introduced the idea of using electronics for Boolean algebraic operations The concept of a fieldeffect transistor was proposed by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925 John Bardeen and Walter Brattain while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs built the first working transistor the pointcontact transistor in 1947 6 7 In 1953 the University of Manchester built the first transistorized computer called the Transistor Computer 8 However early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a massproduction basis which limited them to a number of specialised applications 9 The metaloxidesilicon fieldeffect transistor MOSFET or MOS transistor was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959 10 11 It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and massproduced for a wide range of uses 9 The MOSFET made it possible to build highdensity integrated circuit chips 12 13 leading to what is known as the computer revolution 14 or microcomputer revolution 15 Computer edit Main articles Computer Outline of computers and Glossary of computer terms A computer is a machine that manipulates data according to a set of instructions called a computer program The program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions The same program in its humanreadable source code form enables a programmer to study and develop a sequence of steps known as an algorithm Because the instructions can be carried out in different types of computers a single set of source instructions converts to machine instructions 16 according to the CPU type The execution process carries out the instructions in a computer program Instructions express the computations performed by the computer They trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine Those actions produce effects according to the semantics of the instructions Computer software and hardware edit Main articles Software and Computer hardware Computer software or just software is a collection of computer programs and related data that provides the instructions for telling a computer what to do and how to do it Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes In other words software is a set of programs procedures algorithms and its documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system Program software performs the function of the program it implements either by directly providing instructions to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of software The term was coined to contrast with the old term hardware meaning physical devices In contrast to hardware software is intangible 17 Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense meaning application software only Application software edit Main article Application software Application software also known as an application or an app is a computer software designed to help the user to perform specific tasks Examples include enterprise software accounting software office suites graphics software and media players Many application programs deal principally with documents Apps may be bundled with the computer and its system software or may be published separately Some users are satisfied with the bundled apps and need never install additional applications Application software is contrasted with system software and middleware which manage and integrate a computers capabilities but typically do not directly apply them in the performance of tasks that benefit the user The system software serves the application which in turn serves the user Application software applies the power of a particular computing platform or system software to a particular purpose Some apps such as Microsoft Office are available in versions for several different platforms others have narrower requirements and are thus called for example a Geography application for Windows or an Android application for education or Linux gaming Sometimes a new and popular application arises that only runs on one platform increasing the desirability of that platform This is called a killer application System software edit Main article System software System software or systems software is computer software designed to operate and control the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software System software includes operating systems utility software device drivers window systems and firmware Frequently development tools such as compilers linkers and debuggers 18 are classified as system software Computer network edit Main article Computer network A computer network often simply referred to as a network is a collection of hardware components and computers interconnected by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information 19 Where at least one process in one device is able to sendreceive data tofrom at least one process residing in a remote device then the two devices are said to be in a network Networks may be classified according to a wide variety of characteristics such as the medium used to transport the data communications protocol used scale topology and organizational scope Communications protocols define the rules and data formats for exchanging information in a computer network and provide the basis for network programming Wellknown communications protocols are Ethernet a hardware and Link Layer standard that is ubiquitous in local area networks and the Internet Protocol Suite which defines a set of protocols for internetworking ie for data communication between multiple networks as well as hosttohost data transfer and applicationspecific data transmission formats Computer networking is sometimes considered a subdiscipline of electrical engineering telecommunications computer science information technology or computer engineering since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of these disciplines Internet edit Main article Internet The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite TCPIP to serve billions of users that consists of millions of private public academic business and government networks of local to global scope that are linked by a broad array of electronic wireless and optical networking technologies The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services such as the interlinked hypertext documents of the World Wide Web and the infrastructure to support email Computer programming edit Main articles Computer programming and Software engineering Computer programming in general is the process of writing testing debugging and maintaining the source code and documentation of computer programs This source code is written in a programming language which is an artificial language often more restrictive or demanding than natural languages but easily translated by the computer The purpose of programming is to invoke the desired behavior customization from the machine The process of writing high quality source code requires knowledge of both the applications domain and the computer science domain The highestquality software is thus developed by a team of various domain experts each person a specialist in some area of development But the term programmer may apply to a range of program quality from hacker to open source contributor to professional And a single programmer could do most or all of the computer programming needed to generate the proof of concept to launch a new killer application Computer programmer edit Main articles Programmer Software engineer and Software developer A programmer computer programmer or coder is a person who writes computer software The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computer programming or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst A programmers primary computer language C C Java Lisp Python etc is often prefixed to the above titles and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with web The term programmer can be used to refer to a software developer software engineer computer scientist or software analyst However members of these professions typically 20 possess other software engineering skills beyond programming Computer industry edit Main article Computer industry The computer industry is made up of all of the businesses involved in developing computer software designing computer hardware and computer networking infrastructures the manufacture of computer components and the provision of information technology services including system administration and maintenance Software industry edit Main article Software industry The software industry includes businesses engaged in development maintenance and publication of software The industry also includes software services such as training documentation and consulting Subdisciplines of computing edit Computer engineering edit Main article Computer engineering Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software 21 Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering or electrical engineering software design and hardwaresoftware integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing from the design of individual microprocessors personal computers and supercomputers to circuit design This field of engineering not only focuses on the design of hardware within its own domain but as well the interactions between hardware and the world around it 22 Software engineering edit Main article Software engineering Software engineering SE is the application of a systematic disciplined quantifiable approach to the design development operation and maintenance of software and the study of these approaches that is the application of engineering to software 23 24 25 In laymans terms it is the act of using insights to conceive model and scale a solution to a problem The first reference to the term is the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference and was meant to provoke thought regarding the perceived software crisis at the time 26 27 28 Software development a much used and more generic term does not necessarily subsume the engineering paradigm The generally accepted concepts of Software Engineering as an engineering discipline have been specified in the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge SWEBOK The SWEBOK has become an internationally accepted standard ISOIEC TR 197592015 29 Computer science edit Main articles Computer science and Computer scientist Computer science or computing science abbreviated CS or Comp Sci is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems 30 Its subfields can be divided into practical techniques for its implementation and application in computer systems and purely theoretical areas Some such as computational complexity theory which studies fundamental properties of computational problems are highly abstract while others such as computer graphics emphasize realworld applications Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations For example programming language theory studies approaches to description of computations while the study of computer programming itself investigates various aspects of the use of programming languages and complex systems and humancomputer interaction focuses on the challenges in making computers and computations useful usable and universally accessible to humans Information systems edit Main article Information systems Information systems IS is the study of complementary networks of hardware and software see information technology that people and organizations use to collect filter process create and distribute data 31 32 33 34 35 The ACM s Computing Careers website says A majority of IS degree programs are located in business schools however they may have different names such as management information systems computer information systems or business information systems All IS degrees combine business and computing topics but the emphasis between technical and organizational issues varies among programs For example programs differ substantially in the amount of programming required 36 The study bridges business and computer science using the theoretical foundations of information and computation to study various business models and related algorithmic processes within a computer science discipline 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 Computer Information Systems CIS edit This field studies computers and algorithmic processes including their principles their software and hardware designs their applications and their impact on society 47 48 49 while IS emphasizes functionality over design 50 Information technology edit Main article Information technology Information technology IT is the application of computers and telecommunications equipment to store retrieve transmit and manipulate data 51 often in the context of a business or other enterprise 52 The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones Several industries are associated with information technology such as computer hardware software electronics semiconductors internet telecom equipment ecommerce and computer services 53 54 Systems administration edit Main article System administrator A system administrator IT systems administrator systems administrator or sysadmin is a person employed to maintain and operate a computer system or network The duties of a system administrator are wideranging and may vary substantially from one organization to another Sysadmins are usually charged with installing supporting and maintaining servers or other computer systems and planning for and responding to service outages and other problems Other duties may include scripting or light programming project management for systemsrelated projects supervising or training computer operators and being the consultant for computer problems beyond the knowledge of technical support staff Research and emerging technologies edit Further information List of unsolved problems in computer science DNAbased computing and quantum computing are areas of active research in both hardware and software such as the development of quantum algorithms Potential infrastructure for future technologies includes DNA origami on photolithography 55 and quantum antennae for transferring information between ion traps 56 By 2011 researchers had entangled 14 qubits 57 58 Fast digital circuits including those based on Josephson junctions and rapid single flux quantum technology are becoming more nearly realizable with the discovery of nanoscale superconductors 59 Fiberoptic and photonic optical devices which already have been used to transport data over long distances have started being used by data centers side by side with CPU and semiconductor memory components This allows the separation of RAM from CPU by optical interconnects 60 IBM has created an integrated circuit with both electronic and optical information processing in one chip This is denoted CMOSintegrated nanophotonics or CINP 61 One benefit of optical interconnects is that motherboards which formerly required a certain kind of system on a chip SoC can now move formerly dedicated memory and network controllers off the motherboards spreading the controllers out onto the rack This allows standardization of backplane interconnects and motherboards for multiple types of SoCs which allows more timely upgrades of CPUs 62 Another field of research is spintronics Spintronics can provide computing power and storage without heat buildup 63 Some research is being done on hybrid chips which combine photonics and spintronics 64 65 Cloud Computing edit Cloud computing is a model that allows for the use of computing resources such as servers or applications without the need for much interaction between the owner of these resources and the user using them Typically this is offered as a service making it another example of Software as a Service Platforms as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service depending on what functionality is offered Key characteristics include ondemand access broad network access and the capability of rapid scaling 66 Cloud computing is also being talked about regarding energy conservation Allowing thousands of instances of computation to occur on one single machine instead of thousands of individual machines could be a way to save energy It would also ease the act of transitioning to more renewable energy because you would only need to power one server farm with a set of solar panels or wind turbines instead of millions of peoples homes 67 However computing being done from a centralized location has its own challenges One of the major ones is security With cloud computing companies having no obligation to tell you what data they have on you where its being kept or how they are using it Laws in the modern day are not yet equipped to handle these circumstances In the future lawmakers in many countries will have to push to regulate cloud computing and protect the privacy of users 68 Cloud computing is also a way for individual users or small business to benefit from economies of scale While currently the cloud computing infrastructure is too underdeveloped to benefit the scientific community within a few years of development it could also be used to help smaller research groups get the computing power they need to answer a lot of the worlds questions 69 Quantum Computing edit Quantum computing is an area of research that brings together the disciplines of computer science information theory and quantum physics The idea of information being a basic part of physics is relatively new but there seems to be a strong tie between information theory and quantum mechanics 70 Whereas traditional computing operates on a binary system of ones and zeros quantum computing uses qubits Qubits are capable of being in a superposition which means that they are in both states one and zero simultaneously This means the qubit is not somewhere between 1 and 0 but actually the value of the qubit will change depending on when you measure it This trait of qubits is called quantum entanglement and is the core idea of quantum computing and is what allows quantum computers to do the large scale equations they are used for 71 Quantum computing is often used for scientific research where a normal computer does not have nearly enough computational power to do the calculations necessary A good example would be molecular modeling Large molecules are far too complex for modern computers to calculate what happens to them during a reaction but the power of quantum computers could open the doors to further understanding these molecules See also
