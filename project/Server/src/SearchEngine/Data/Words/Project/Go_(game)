mathematics Computer Go Go software Internet Go servers AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol v t e Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent The game was invented in China more than 2500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day 1 2 A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation s 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go and over 20 million current players the majority of whom live in East Asia 3 The playing pieces are called stones One player uses the white stones and the other black The players take turns placing the stones on the vacant intersections points of a board Once placed on the board stones may not be moved but stones are removed from the board if captured Capture happens when a stone or group of stones is surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally adjacent points 4 The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move When a game concludes the winner is determined by counting each players surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second 5 Games may also be terminated by resignation The standard Go board has a 1919 grid of lines containing 361 points Beginners often play on smaller 99 and 1313 boards 6 and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 1717 grid However boards with a 1919 grid had become standard by the time the game had reached Korea in the 5th century CE and later Japan in the 7th century CE 7 Go was considered one of the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic Chinese scholars in antiquity The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal Zuo Zhuan 8 9 c 4th century BC 10 Despite its relatively simple rules Go is very complex Compared to chess Go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games and on average many more alternatives to consider per move The lower bound on the number of legal board positions in Go has been estimated to be 2 10 170 11 12 which is greater than the number of atoms in the universe 13 Contents 1 Etymology 2 Overview 3 Rules 31 Basic rules 32 Liberties and capture 33 Ko rule 34

hjwɨjgi which roughly translates as board game of surrounding or encircling game To differentiate the game from the common English verb to go g is often capitalized 14 or in events sponsored by the Ing Changki Foundation it is spelled goe 15 The Korean word baduk derives from the Middle Korean word Badok the origin of which is controversial the more plausible etymologies include the suffix dok added to Ba creating the meaning flat and wide board or the joining of Bat meaning field and Dok meaning stone Less plausible etymologies include a derivation of Badukdok referring to the playing pieces of the game or a derivation from Chinese 排子 meaning to arrange pieces 16 Overview edit The first 60 moves of a Go game animated This particular game quickly developed into a complicated fight in the lower left and bottom Click on the board to restart the play in a larger window Go is an adversarial game with the objective of surrounding a larger total area of the board with ones stones than the opponent 17 As the game progresses the players position stones on the board to map out formations and potential territories Contests between opposing formations are often extremely complex and may result in the expansion reduction or wholesale capture and loss of formation stones The four liberties adjacent empty points of a single black stone A as White reduces those liberties by one B C and D When Black has only one liberty left D that stone is in atari 18 White may capture that stone remove from board with a play on its last liberty at D1 A basic principle of Go is that a group of stones must have at least one liberty to remain on the board A liberty is an open point intersection bordering the group An enclosed liberty or liberties is called an eye and a group of stones with two or more eyes is said to be unconditionally alive 19 Such groups cannot be captured even if surrounded 20 The general strategy is to expand ones territory attack the opponents weak groups groups that can be killed and always stay mindful of the life status of ones own groups 21 22 The liberties of groups are countable Situations where mutually opposing groups must capture each other or die are called capturing races or semeai 23 In a capturing race the group with more liberties andor better shape will ultimately be able to capture the opponents stones 23 24 Capturing races and the elements of life or death are the primary challenges of Go A player may pass on determining that the game offers no further opportunities for profitable play The game ends when both players pass 25 and is then scored For each player the number of captured stones is subtracted from the number of controlled surrounded points in liberties or eyes and the player with the greater score wins the game 26 Games may also be won by resignation of the opponent In the opening stages of the game players typically establish positions or bases in the corners and around the sides of the board These bases help to quickly develop strong shapes which have many options for life selfviability for a group of stones that prevents capture and establish formations for potential territory 27 Players usually start in the corners because establishing territory is easier with the aid of two edges of the board 28 Established corner opening sequences are called joseki and are often studied independently 29 Dame are points that lie in between the boundary walls of black and white and as such are considered to be of no value to either side Seki are mutually alive pairs of white and black groups where neither has two eyes A ko Chinese and Japanese 劫 is a repeatedposition shape that may be contested by making forcing moves elsewhere After the forcing move is played the ko may be taken back and returned to its original position 30 Some ko fights may be important and decide the life of a large group while others may be worth just one or two points Some ko fights are referred to as picnic kos when only one side has a lot to lose 31 The Japanese call it a hanami flowerviewing ko 32 Playing with others usually requires a knowledge of each players strength indicated by the players rank increasing from 30kyu to 1kyu then 1dan to 7dan then 1dan pro to 9dan pro A difference in rank may be compensated by a handicapBlack is allowed to place two or more stones on the board to compensate for Whites greater strength 33 34 There are different rulesets Japanese Chinese AGA etc which are almost entirely equivalent except for certain specialcase positions Rules edit Main article Rules of Go Aside from the order of play alternating moves Black moves first or takes a handicap and scoring rules there are essentially only two rules in Go Rule 1 the rule of liberty states that every stone remaining on the board must have at least one open point an intersection called a liberty directly orthogonally adjacent up down left or right or must be part of a connected group that has at least one such open point liberty next to it Stones or groups of stones which lose their last liberty are removed from the board Rule 2 the ko rule states that the stones on the board must never repeat a previous position of stones Moves which would do so are forbidden and thus only moves elsewhere on the board are permitted that turn Almost all other information about how the game is played is a heuristic meaning it is learned information about how the game is played rather than a rule Other rules are specialized as they come about through different rulesets but the above two rules cover almost all of any played game Although there are some minor differences between rulesets used in different countries 35 most notably in Chinese and Japanese scoring rules 36 these differences do not greatly affect the tactics and strategy of the game Except where noted the basic rules presented here are valid independent of the scoring rules used The scoring rules are explained separately Go terms for which there are no ready English equivalent are commonly called by their Japanese names Basic rules edit One black chain and two white chains with their liberties marked with dots Liberties are shared among all stones of a chain and can be counted Here the black group has 5 liberties while the two white chains have 4 liberties each The two players Black and White take turns placing stones of their colour on the intersections of the board one stone at a time The usual board size is a 19x19 grid but for beginners or for playing quick games 37 the smaller board sizes of 13x13 38 and 9x9 are also popular 39 The board is empty to begin with 40 Black plays first unless black is given a handicap of two stones or more in which case white plays first The players may choose any unoccupied intersection to play on except for those forbidden by the ko and suicide rules see below Once played a stone can never be moved and can be taken off the board only if it is captured 41 A player may also pass declining to place a stone though this is usually only done at the end of the game when both players believe nothing more can be accomplished with further play When both players pass consecutively the game ends 42 and is then scored Liberties and capture edit Vertically and horizontally adjacent stones of the same color form a chain also called a string or group 43 forming a discrete unit that cannot then be divided 44 Only stones connected to one another by the lines on the board create a chain stones that are diagonally adjacent are not connected Chains may be expanded by placing additional stones on adjacent intersections and can be connected together by placing a stone on an intersection that is adjacent to two or more chains of the same color 45 A vacant point adjacent to a stone along one of the grid lines of the board is called a liberty for that stone 46 47 Stones in a chain share their liberties 43 A chain of stones must have at least one liberty to remain on the board When a chain is surrounded by opposing stones so that it has no liberties it is captured and removed from the board 48 If White plays at A the black chain loses its last liberty It is captured and removed from the board Ko rule edit Main article Ko fight An example of a situation in which the ko rule applies Players are not allowed to make a move that returns the game to the previous position This rule called the ko rule prevents unending repetition 49 As shown in the example pictured Black has just played the stone marked 1 capturing a white stone at the intersection marked with the red circle If White were allowed to play on the marked intersection that move would capture the black stone marked 1 and recreate the situation before Black made the move marked 1 Allowing this could result in an unending cycle of captures by both players The ko rule therefore prohibits White from playing at the marked intersection immediately Instead White must play elsewhere or pass Black can then end the ko by filling at the marked intersection creating a fivestone black chain If White wants to continue the ko that specific repeating position White tries to find a play elsewhere on the board that Black must answer if Black answers then White can retake the ko A repetition of such exchanges is called a ko fight 50 While the various rulesets agree on the ko rule prohibiting returning the board to an immediately previous position they deal in different ways with the relatively uncommon situation in which a player might recreate a past position that is further removed See Rules of Go Repetition for further information Suicide edit Under normal rules White cannot play at A because that point has no liberties Under the Ing 51 and New Zealand rules 52 White may play A a suicide stone that kills itself and the two neighboring white stones leaving an empty threespace eye Black naturally answers by playing at A creating two eyes A player may not place a stone such that it or its group immediately has no liberties unless doing so immediately deprives an enemy group of its final liberty In the latter case the enemy group is captured leaving the new stone with at least one liberty 53 This rule is responsible for the allimportant difference between one and two eyes if a group with only one eye is fully surrounded on the outside it can be killed with a stone placed in its single eye The Ing and New Zealand rules do not have this rule 54 and there a player might destroy one of its own groupscommit suicide This play would only be useful in a limited set of situations involving a small interior space 55 In the example at right it may be useful as a ko threat Komi edit Main article Komidashi Because Black has the advantage of playing the first move the idea of awarding White some compensation came into being during the 20th century This is called komi which gives white a 65point compensation under Japanese rules number of points varies by rule set 56 Under handicap play White receives only a 05point komi to break a possible tie jigo Scoring rules edit A simplified game at its end Blacks territory A C and prisoners D is counted and compared to Whites territory B only no prisoners In this example both Black and White attempted to invade and live C and D groups to reduce the others total territory Only Blacks invading group C was successful in living as Whites group D was killed with a black stone at E The points in the middle F are dame meaning they belong to neither player Two general types of scoring system are used and players determine which to use before play Both systems almost always give the same result Territory scoring counts the number of empty points a players stones surround together with the number of stones the player captured Area scoring counts the number of points a players stones occupy and surround It is associated with contemporary Chinese play and was probably established there during the Ming Dynasty in the 15th or 16th century 57 After both players have passed consecutively the stones that are still on the board but unable to avoid capture called dead stones are removed Area scoring including Chinese A players score is the number of stones that the player has on the board plus the number of empty intersections surrounded by that players stones Territory scoring including Japanese and Korean In the course of the game each player retains the stones they capture termed prisoners Any dead stones removed at the end of the game become prisoners The score is the number of empty points enclosed by a players stones plus the number of prisoners captured by that player nb 1 If there is disagreement about which stones are dead then under area scoring rules the players simply resume play to resolve the matter The score is computed using the position after the next time the players pass consecutively Under territory scoring the rules are considerably more complex however in practice players generally play on and once the status of each stone has been determined return to the position at the time the first two consecutive passes occurred and remove the dead stones For further information see Rules of Go Given that the number of stones a player has on the board is directly related to the number of prisoners their opponent has taken the resulting net score that is the difference between Blacks and Whites scores is identical under both rulesets unless the players have passed different numbers of times during the course of the game Thus the net result given by the two scoring systems rarely differs by more than a point 58 Life and death edit See also Life and death While not actually mentioned in the rules of Go at least in simpler rule sets such as those of New Zealand and the US the concept of a living group of stones is necessary for a practical understanding of the game 59 Examples of eyes marked The black groups at the top of the board are alive as they have at least two eyes The black groups at the bottom are dead as they only have one eye The point marked a is a false eye When a group of stones is mostly surrounded and has no options to connect with friendly stones elsewhere the status of the group is either alive dead or unsettled A group of stones is said to be alive if it cannot be captured even if the opponent is allowed to move first Conversely a group of stones is said to be dead if it cannot avoid capture even if the owner of the group is allowed the first move Otherwise the group is said to be unsettled the defending player can make it alive or the opponent can kill it depending on who gets to play first 59 An eye is an empty point or group of points surrounded by one players stones If the eye is surrounded by Black stones White cannot play there unless such a play would take Blacks last liberty and capture the Black stones Such a move is forbidden according to the suicide rule in most rule sets but even if not forbidden such a move would be a useless suicide of a White stone If a Black group has two eyes White can never capture it because White cannot remove both liberties simultaneously If Black has only one eye White can capture the Black group by playing in the single eye removing Blacks last liberty Such a move is not suicide because the Black stones are removed first In the Examples of eyes diagram all the circled points are eyes The two black groups in the upper corners are alive as both have at least two eyes The groups in the lower corners are dead as both have only one eye The group in the lower left may seem to have two eyes but the surrounded empty point marked a is not actually an eye White can play there and take a black stone Such a point is often called a false eye 59 Seki mutual life edit Example of seki mutual life Neither Black nor White can play on the marked points without reducing their own liberties for those groups to one selfatari There is an exception to the requirement that a group must have two eyes to be alive a situation called seki or mutual life Where different colored groups are adjacent and share liberties the situation may reach a position when neither player wants to move first because doing so would allow the opponent to capture in such situations therefore both players stones remain on the board in mutual life or seki Neither player receives any points for those groups but at least those groups themselves remain living as opposed to being captured nb 2 Seki can occur in many ways The simplest are each player has a group without eyes and they share two liberties and each player has a group with one eye and they share one more liberty In the Example of seki mutual life diagram the circled points are liberties shared by both a black and a white group Neither player wants to play on a circled point because doing so would allow the opponent to capture All the other groups in this example both black and white are alive with at least two eyes Seki can result from an attempt by one player to invade and kill a nearly settled group of the other player 59 Tactics edit Main article Go strategy and tactics In Go tactics deal with immediate fighting between stones capturing and saving stones life death and other issues localized to a specific part of the board Larger issues not limited to only part of the board are referred to as strategy and are covered in their own section Capturing tactics edit There are several tactical constructs aimed at capturing stones 60 These are among the first things a player learns after understanding the rules Recognizing the possibility that stones can be captured using these techniques is an important step forward A ladder Black cannot escape unless the ladder connects to black stones further down the board that will intercept with the ladder The most basic technique is the ladder 61 To capture stones in a ladder a player uses a constant series of capture threatscalled atari to force the opponent into a zigzag pattern as shown in the adjacent diagram Unless the pattern runs into friendly stones along the way the stones in the ladder cannot avoid capture Experienced players recognize the futility of continuing the pattern and play elsewhere The presence of a ladder on the board does give a player the option to play a stone in the path of the ladder thereby threatening to rescue their stones forcing a response Such a move is called a ladder breaker and may be a powerful strategic move In the diagram Black has the option of playing a ladder breaker A net The chain of three marked black stones cannot escape in any direction Another technique to capture stones is the socalled net 62 also known by its Japanese name geta This refers to a move that loosely surrounds some stones preventing their escape in all directions An example is given in the adjacent diagram It is generally better to capture stones in a net than in a ladder because a net does not depend on the condition that there are no opposing stones in the way nor does it allow the opponent to play a strategic ladder breaker A snapback Although Black can capture the white stone by playing at the circled point the resulting shape for Black has only one liberty at 1 thus White can then capture the three black stones by playing at 1 again snap back A third technique to capture stones is the snapback 63 In a snapback one player allows a single stone to be captured then immediately plays on the point formerly occupied by that stone by so doing the player captures a larger group of their opponents stones in effect snapping back at those stones An example can be seen on the right As with the ladder an experienced player does not play out such a sequence recognizing the futility of capturing only to be captured back immediately Reading ahead edit One of the most important skills required for strong tactical play is the ability to read ahead 64 Reading ahead includes considering available moves to play the possible responses to each move and the subsequent possibilities after each of those responses Some of the strongest players of the game can read up to 40 moves ahead even in complicated positions 65 As explained in the scoring rules some stone formations can never be captured and are said to be alive while other stones may be in the position where they cannot avoid being captured and are said to be dead Much of the practice material available to players of the game comes in the form of life and death problems also known as tsumego 66 In such problems players are challenged to find the vital move sequence that kills a group of the opponent or saves a group of their own Tsumego are considered an excellent way to train a players ability at reading ahead 66 and are available for all skill levels some posing a challenge even to top players Ko fighting edit A simplified ko fight on a 99 board The ko is at the point marked with a squareBlack has taken the ko first The ko fight determines the life of the A and B groupsonly one survives and the other is captured White may play C as a ko threat and Black properly answers at D White can then take the ko by playing at the squaremarked point capturing the one black stone E is a possible ko threat for Black In situations when the Ko rule applies a ko fight may occur 50 If the player who is prohibited from capture is of the opinion that the capture is important because it prevents a large group of stones from being captured for instance the player may play a ko threat 50 This is a move elsewhere on the board that threatens to make a large profit if the opponent does not respond If the opponent does respond to the ko threat the situation on the board has changed and the prohibition on capturing the ko no longer applies Thus the player who made the ko threat may now recapture the ko Their opponent is then in the same situation and can either play a ko threat as well or concede the ko by simply playing elsewhere If a player concedes the ko either because they do not think it important or because there are no moves left that could function as a ko threat they have lost the ko and their opponent may connect the ko Instead of responding to a ko threat a player may also choose to ignore the threat and connect the ko 50 They thereby win the ko but at a cost The choice of when to respond to a threat and when to ignore it is a subtle one which requires a player to consider many factors including how much is gained by connecting how much is lost by not responding how many possible ko threats both players have remaining what the optimal order of playing them is and what the size points lost or gainedof each of the remaining threats is 67 Frequently the winner of the ko fight does not connect the ko but instead captures one of the chains that constituted their opponents side of the ko 50 In some cases this leads to another ko fight at a neighboring location Strategy edit Main article Go strategy and tactics Strategy deals with global influence interaction between distant stones keeping the whole board in mind during local fights and other issues that involve the overall game It is therefore possible to allow a tactical loss when it confers a strategic advantage Novices often start by randomly placing stones on the board as if it were a game of chance An understanding of how stones connect for greater power develops and then a few basic common opening sequences may be understood Learning the ways of life and death helps in a fundamental way to develop ones strategic understanding of weak groups nb 3 A player who both plays aggressively and can handle adversity is said to display kiai or fighting spirit in the game Basic concepts edit This section needs additional citations for verification Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources Unsourced material may be challenged and removed Find

Keeping ones own stones connected means that fewer groups need to make living shape and one has fewer groups to defend Cut Keeping opposing stones disconnected means that the opponent needs to defend and make living shape for more groups Stay alive The simplest way to stay alive is to establish a foothold in the corner or along one of the sides At a minimum a group must have two eyes separate open points to be alive 68 An opponent cannot fill in either eye as any such move is suicidal and prohibited in the rules Mutual life seki is better than dying A situation in which neither player can play on a particular point without then allowing the other player to play at another point to capture The most common example is that of adjacent groups that share their last few libertiesif either player plays in the shared liberties they can reduce their own group to a single liberty putting themselves in atari allowing their opponent to capture it on the next move Death A group that lacks living shape is eventually removed from the board as captured Invasion Set up a new living group inside an area where the opponent has greater influence means one reduces the opponents score in proportion to the area one occupies Reduction Placing a stone far enough into the opponents area of influence to reduce the amount of territory they eventually get but not so far in that it can be cut off from friendly stones outside Sente A play that forces ones opponent to respond gote A player who can regularly play sente has the initiative and can control the flow of the game Sacrifice Allowing a group to die in order to carry out a play or plan in a more important area The strategy involved can become very abstract and complex Highlevel players spend years improving their understanding of strategy and a novice may play many hundreds of games against opponents before being able to win regularly Opening strategy edit Main article Go opening In the opening of the game players usually play and gain territory in the corners of the board first as the presence of two edges makes it easier for them to surround territory and establish their stones 69 From a secure position in a corner it is possible to lay claim to more territory by extending along the side of the board 70 The opening is the most theoretically difficult part of the game and takes a large proportion of professional players thinking time 71 72 The first stone played at a corner of the board is generally placed on the third or fourth line from the edge Playing nearer to the edge does not produce enough territory to be efficient and playing further from the edge does not safely secure the territory 73 In the opening players often play established sequences called joseki which are locally balanced exchanges 74 however the joseki chosen should also produce a satisfactory result on a global scale It is generally advisable to keep a balance between territory and influence Which of these gets precedence is often a matter of individual taste Middlegame and endgame edit The middle phase of the game is the most combative and usually lasts for more than 100 moves During the middlegame the players invade each others territories and attack formations that lack the necessary two eyes for viability Such groups may be saved or sacrificed for something more significant on the board 75 It is possible that one player may succeed in capturing a large weak group of the opponents which often proves decisive and ends the game by a resignation However matters may be more complex yet with major tradeoffs apparently dead groups reviving and skillful play to attack in such a way as to construct territories rather than kill 76 The end of the middlegame and transition to the endgame is marked by a few features Near the end of a game play becomes divided into localized fights that do not affect each other 77 with the exception of ko fights where before the central area of the board related to all parts of it No large weak groups are still in serious danger Moves can reasonably be attributed some definite value such as 20 points or fewer rather than simply being necessary to compete Both players set limited objectives in their plans in making or destroying territory capturing or saving stones These changing aspects of the game usually occur at much the same time for strong players In brief the middlegame switches into the endgame when the concepts of strategy and influence need reassessment in terms of concrete final results on the board History edit Go Chinese name Simplified

of 548 BC It is also mentioned in Book XVII of the Analects of Confucius 10 and in two books written by Mencius 9 78 c 3rd century BC 10 In all of these works the game is referred to as yì 弈 Today in China it is known as weiqi simplified Chinese 围棋 traditional Chinese 圍棋 pinyin wéiqí WadeGiles wei chi literally encirclement board game A 1919 Go board model from a Sui dynasty 581618 CE tomb Go was originally played on a 1717 line grid but a 1919 grid became standard by the time of the Tang Dynasty 618907 9 Legends trace the origin of the game to the mythical Chinese emperor Yao 23372258 BC who was said to have had his counselor Shun design it for his unruly son Danzhu to favorably influence him 79 Other theories suggest that the game was derived from Chinese tribal warlords and generals who used pieces of stone to map out attacking positions 80 81 Woman Playing Go Tang Dynasty c 744 discovered at the Astana Graves In China Go was considered one of the four cultivated arts of the Chinese scholar gentleman along with calligraphy painting and playing the musical instrument guqin 82 In ancient times the rules of go were passed on verbally rather than being written down 83 Spread to Korea and Japan edit Weiqi was introduced to Korea sometime between the 5th and 7th centuries CE and was popular among the higher classes In Korea the game is called baduk hangul 바둑 and a variant of the game called Sunjang baduk was developed by the 16th century Sunjang baduk became the main variant played in Korea until the end of the 19th century when the current version was reintroduced from Japan 84 85 Korean couple in traditional dress play in a photograph dated between 1910 and 1920 The game reached Japan in the 7th century CEwhere it is called go 碁 or igo 囲碁 It became popular at the Japanese imperial court in the 8th century 86 and among the general public by the 13th century 87 The modern version of the game as we know it today was formalized in Japan in the 15th century In 1603 Tokugawa Ieyasu reestablished Japans unified national government In the same year he assigned the thenbest player in Japan a Buddhist monk named Nikkai né Kanō Yosaburo 1559 to the post of Godokoro Minister of Go 88 Illustrated handscroll of The Tale of Genji 12th century Nikkai took the name Honinbō Sansa and founded the Honinbō Go school 88 Several competing schools were founded soon after 88 These officially recognized and subsidized Go schools greatly developed the level of play and introduced the dankyu style system of ranking players 89 Players from the four schools Honinbō Yasui Inoue and Hayashi competed in the annual castle games played in the presence of the shōgun 90 Internationalization edit Despite its widespread popularity in East Asia Go has been slow to spread to the rest of the world Although there are some mentions of the game in western literature from the 16th century forward Go did not start to become popular in the West until the end of the 19th century when German scientist Oskar Korschelt wrote a treatise on the ancient Han Chinese game 91 By the early 20th century Go had spread throughout the German and AustroHungarian empires In 1905 Edward Lasker learned the game while in Berlin When he moved to New York Lasker founded the New York Go Club together with amongst others Arthur Smith who had learned of the game in Japan while touring the East and had published the book The Game of Go in 1908 92 Laskers book Go and Gomoku 1934 helped spread the game throughout the US 92 and in 1935 the American Go Association was formed Two years later in 1937 the German Go Association was founded World War II put a stop to most Go activity since it was a game coming from Japan but after the war Go continued to spread 93 For most of the 20th century the Japan Go Association Nihon Kiin played a leading role in spreading Go outside East Asia by publishing the Englishlanguage magazine Go Review in the 1960s establishing Go centers in the US Europe and South America and often sending professional teachers on tour to Western nations 94 Internationally the game had been commonly known since the start of the twentieth century by its shortened Japanese name and terms for common Go concepts are derived from their Japanese pronunciation In 1996 NASA astronaut Daniel Barry and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata became the first people to play Go in space They used a special Go set which was named Go Space designed by WaiCheung Willson Chow 95 Both astronauts were awarded honorary dan ranks by the Nihon Kiin 95 As of December2015 update the International Go Federation has 75 member countries with 67 member countries outside East Asia 96 Chinese cultural centres across the world are promoting Go and cooperating with local Go associations for example the seminars held by the Chinese cultural centre in Tel Aviv Israel together with the Israeli Go association 97 Competitive play edit Ranks and ratings edit Main article Go ranks and ratings Three Japanese professional Go players observe some younger amateurs as they dissect a life and death problem in the corner of the board at the US Go Congress in Houston Texas 2003 In Go rank indicates a players skill in the game Traditionally ranks are measured using kyu and dan grades 98 a system also adopted by many martial arts More recently mathematical rating systems similar to the Elo rating system have been introduced 99 Such rating systems often provide a mechanism for converting a rating to a kyu or dan grade 99 Kyu grades abbreviated k are considered student grades and decrease as playing level increases meaning 1st kyu is the strongest available kyu grade Dan grades abbreviated d are considered master grades and increase from 1st dan to 7th dan First dan equals a black belt in eastern martial arts using this system The difference among each amateur rank is one handicap stone For example if a 5k plays a game with a 1k the 5k would need a handicap of four stones to even the odds Toplevel amateur players sometimes defeat professionals in tournament play 100 Professional players have professional dan ranks abbreviated p These ranks are separate from amateur ranks The rank system comprises from the lowest to highest ranks Rank Type Range Stage Doubledigit kyu 3021k Beginner Doubledigit kyu 2010k Casual player Singledigit kyu 91k Intermediateclub player Amateur dan 17d where 8d is a special title Advanced player Professional dan 19p where 10p is a special title Professionals Tournament and match rules edit See also Go competitions Tournament and match rules deal with factors that may influence the game but are not part of the actual rules of play Such rules may differ between events Rules that influence the game include the setting of compensation points komi handicap and time control parameters Rules that do not generally influence the game are the tournament system pairing strategies and placement criteria Common tournament systems used in Go include the McMahon system 101 Swiss system league systems and the knockout system Tournaments may combine multiple systems many professional Go tournaments use a combination of the league and knockout systems 102 Tournament rules may also set the following compensation points called komi which compensate the second player for the first move advantage of his opponent tournaments commonly use a compensation in the range of 58 points 103 generally including a halfpoint to prevent draws handicap stones placed on the board before alternate play allowing players of different strengths to play competitively see Go handicap for more information and superko Although the basic ko rule described above covers more than 95 of all cycles occurring in games 104 there are some complex situations triple ko eternal life nb 4 etcthat are not covered by it but would allow the game to cycle indefinitely To prevent this the ko rule is sometimes extended to forbid the repetition of any previous position This extension is called superko 104 Time control edit See also Time control and Byoyomi A game of Go may be timed using a game clock Formal time controls were introduced into the professional game during the 1920s and were controversial 105 Adjournments and sealed moves began to be regulated in the 1930s Go tournaments use a number of different time control systems All common systems envisage a single main period of time for each player for the game but they vary on the protocols for continuation in overtime after a player has finished that time allowance nb 5 The most widely used time control system is the socalled byoyomi nb 6 system The top professional Go matches have timekeepers so that the players do not have to press their own clocks Two widely used variants of the byoyomi system are 106 Standard byoyomi After the main time is depleted a player has a certain number of time periods typically around thirty seconds After each move the number of fulltime periods that the player took often zero is subtracted For example if a player has three thirtysecond time periods and takes thirty or more but less than sixty seconds to make a move they lose one time period With 6089seconds they lose two time periods and so on If however they take less than thirty seconds the timer simply resets without subtracting any periods Using up the last period means that the player has lost on time Canadian byoyomi After using all of their main time a player must make a certain number of moves within a certain period of time such as twenty moves within five minutes 106 nb 7 If the time period expires without the required number of stones having been played then the player has lost on time nb 8 Notation and recording games edit See also Kifu Go games are recorded with a simple coordinate system This is comparable to algebraic chess notation except that Go stones do not move and thus require only one coordinate per turn Coordinate systems include purely numerical 44 point hybrid K3 and purely alphabetical 107 The Smart Game Format uses alphabetical coordinates internally but most editors represent the board with hybrid coordinates as this reduces confusion The Japanese word kifu is sometimes used to refer to a game record In Unicode Go stones can be represented with black and white circles from the block Geometric Shapes mwparseroutput

professional and List of professional Go tournaments A Go professional is a professional player of the game of Go There are six areas with professional go associations these are China China Qiyuan Japan Nihon Kiin Kansai Kiin South Korea Korea Baduk Association Taiwan Taiwan Chi Yuan Culture Foundation the United States AGA Professional System and Europe European Professional System Although the game was developed in China the establishment of the Four Go houses by Tokugawa Ieyasu at the start of the 17th century shifted the focus of the Go world to Japan State sponsorship allowing players to dedicate themselves fulltime to study of the game and fierce competition between individual houses resulted in a significant increase in the level of play During this period the best player of his generation was given the prestigious title Meijin master and the post of Godokoro minister of Go Of special note are the players who were dubbed Kisei Go Sage The only three players to receive this honor were Dōsaku Jōwa and Shūsaku all of the house Honinbō 111 Honinbō Shūsai left last head of house Honinbō plays against thenupandcoming Go Seigen in the game of the century After the end of the Tokugawa shogunate and the Meiji Restoration period the Go houses slowly disappeared and in 1924 the Nihon Kiin Japanese Go Association was formed Top players from this period often played newspapersponsored matches of 210 games 112 Of special note are the Chineseborn player Go Seigen Chinese Wu Qingyuan who scored 80 in these matches and beat down most of his opponents to inferior handicaps 113 and Minoru Kitani who dominated matches in the early 1930s 114 These two players are also recognized for their groundbreaking work on new opening theory Shinfuseki 115 For much of the 20th century Go continued to be dominated by players trained in Japan Notable names included Eio Sakata Rin Kaiho born in China Masao Kato Koichi Kobayashi and Cho Chikun born Cho Chihun from South Korea 116 Top Chinese and Korean talents often moved to Japan because the level of play there was high and funding was more lavish One of the first Korean players to do so was Cho Namchul who studied in the Kitani Dojo 19371944 After his return to Korea the Hanguk Kiwon Korea Baduk Association was formed and caused the level of play in South Korea to rise significantly in the second half of the 20th century 117 In China the game declined during the Cultural Revolution 19661976 but quickly recovered in the last quarter of the 20th century bringing Chinese players such as Nie Weiping and Ma Xiaochun on par with their Japanese and South Korean counterparts 118 The Chinese Weiqi Association today part of the China Qiyuan was established in 1962 professional dan grades started being issued in 1982 119 Western professional Go began in 2012 with the American Go Associations Professional System 120 In 2014 the European Go Federation followed suit and started their professional system 121 South Korean player Lee Changho plays against Russian player Alexandre Dinerchtein seventime European Champion and one of the few nonEast Asian players to reach professional status With the advent of major international titles from 1989 onward it became possible to compare the level of players from different countries more accurately Cho Hunhyun of South Korea won the first edition of the Quadrennial Ing Cup in 1989 His disciple Lee Changho was the dominant player in international Go competitions for more than a decade spanning much of 1990s and early 2000s he is also credited with groundbreaking works on the endgame Cho Lee and other South Korean players such as Seo Bongsoo Yoo Changhyuk and Lee Sedol between them won majority of international titles in this period 122 Several Chinese players also rose to the top in international Go from 2000s most notably Ma Xiaochun Chang Hao Gu Li and Ke Jie As of 2016 update Japan lags behind in the international Go scene Historically more men than women have played Go Special tournaments for women exist but until recently men and women did not compete together at the highest levels however the creation of new open tournaments and the rise of strong female players most notably Rui Naiwei have in recent years highlighted the strength and competitiveness of emerging female players 123 The level in other countries has traditionally been much lower except for some players who had preparatory professional training in East Asia nb 9 Knowledge of the game has been scant elsewhere up until the 20th century A famous player of the 1920s was Edward Lasker nb 10 It was not until the 1950s that more than a few Western players took up the game as other than a passing interest In 1978 Manfred Wimmer became the first Westerner to receive a professional players certificate from an East Asian professional Go association 124 In 2000 American Michael Redmond became the first Western player to achieve a 9 dan rank Equipment edit Main article Go equipment A traditional Japanese set with a solid wooden floor board 碁盤 goban 2 bowls 碁笥 goke and 361 stones 碁石 goishi It is possible to play Go with a simple paper board and coins or plastic tokens for the stones or even by drawing the stones on the board and erasing them when captured More popular midrange equipment includes cardstock a laminated particle board or wood boards with stones of plastic or glass More expensive traditional materials are still used by many players The most expensive Go sets have black stones carved from slate and white stones carved from translucent white shells played on boards carved in a single piece from the trunk of a tree Traditional equipment edit Boards edit The Go board generally referred to by its Japanese name goban 碁盤 typically measures between 45 and 48cm 18 and 19in in length from one players side to the other and 42 to 44cm 16 1 2 to 17 1 4 in in width Chinese boards are slightly larger as a traditional Chinese Go stone is slightly larger to match The board is not square there is a 1514 ratio in length to width because with a perfectly square board from the players viewing angle the perspective creates a foreshortening of the board The added length compensates for this 125 There are two main types of boards a table board similar in most respects to other gameboards like that used for chess and a floor board which is its own freestanding table and at which the players sit The traditional Japanese goban is between 10 and 18cm 39 and 71in thick and has legs it sits on the floor see picture 125 It is preferably made from the rare goldentinged Kaya tree Torreya nucifera with the very best made from Kaya trees up to 700years old More recently the related California Torreya Torreya californica has been prized for its light color and pale rings as well as its reduced expense and more readily available stock The natural resources of Japan have been unable to keep up with the enormous demand for the slowgrowing Kaya trees both T nucifera and T californica take many hundreds of years to grow to the necessary size and they are now extremely rare raising the price of such equipment tremendously 126 As Kaya trees are a protected species in Japan they cannot be harvested until they have died Thus an oldgrowth floorstanding Kaya goban can easily cost in excess of 10000 with the highestquality examples costing more than 60000 127 Other less expensive woods often used to make quality table boards in both Chinese and Japanese dimensions include Hiba Thujopsis dolabrata Katsura Cercidiphyllum japonicum Kauri Agathis and Shin Kaya various varieties of spruce commonly from Alaska Siberia and Chinas Yunnan Province 126 Socalled Shin Kaya is a potentially confusing merchants term shin means new and thus shin kaya is best translated faux kaya because the woods so described are biologically unrelated to Kaya 126 Stones edit A full set of Go stones goishi usually contains 181 black stones and 180 white ones a 1919 grid has 361 points so there are enough stones to cover the board and Black gets the extra odd stone because that player goes first Traditional Japanese stones are doubleconvex and made of clamshell white and slate black 128 The classic slate is nachiguro stone mined in Wakayama Prefecture and the clamshell from the Hamaguri clam however due to a scarcity in the Japanese supply of this clam the stones are most often made of shells harvested from Mexico 128 Historically the most prized stones were made of jade often given to the reigning emperor as a gift 128 In China the game is traditionally played with singleconvex stones 128 made of a composite called Yunzi The material comes from Yunnan Province and is made by sintering a proprietary and tradesecret mixture of mineral compounds derived from the local stone This process dates to the Tang Dynasty and after the knowledge was lost in the 1920s during the Chinese Civil War was rediscovered in the 1960s by the now staterun Yunzi company The material is praised for its colors its pleasing sound as compared to glass or to synthetics such as melamine and its lower cost as opposed to other materials such as slateshell The term yunzi can also refer to a singleconvex stone made of any material however most Englishlanguage Go suppliers specify Yunzi as a material and singleconvex as a shape to avoid confusion as stones made of Yunzi are also available in doubleconvex while synthetic stones can be either shape Traditional stones are made so that black stones are slightly larger in diameter than white this is to compensate for the optical illusion created by contrasting colors that would make equalsized white stones appear larger on the board than black stones 128 nb 11 An example of singleconvex stones and Go Seigen bowls These particular stones are made of Yunzi material and the bowls of jujube wood Bowls edit The bowls for the stones are shaped like a flattened sphere with a level underside 129 The lid is loose fitting and upturned before play to receive stones captured during the game Chinese bowls are slightly larger and a little more rounded a style known generally as Go Seigen Japanese Kitani bowls tend to have a shape closer to that of the bowl of a snifter glass such as for brandy The bowls are usually made of turned wood Mulberry is the traditional material for Japanese bowls but is very expensive wood from the Chinese jujube date tree which has a lighter color it is often stained and slightly more visible grain pattern is a common substitute for rosewood and traditional for Go Seigenstyle bowls Other traditional materials used for making Chinese bowls include lacquered wood ceramics stone and woven straw or rattan The names of the bowl shapes Go Seigen and Kitani were introduced in the last quarter of the 20th century by the professional player Janice Kim as homage to two 20thcentury professional Go players by the same names of Chinese and Japanese nationality respectively who are referred to as the Fathers of modern Go 111 Playing technique and etiquette edit Go players in Shanghai demonstrate the traditional technique of holding a stone The traditional way to place a Go stone is to first take one from the bowl gripping it between the index and middle fingers with the middle finger on top and then placing it directly on the desired intersection 130 One can also place a stone on the board and then slide it into position under appropriate circumstances where it does not move any other stones It is considered respectful towards White for Black to place the first stone of the game in the upper righthand corner 131 Because of symmetry this has no effect on the games outcome It is considered poor manners to run ones fingers through ones bowl of unplayed stones as the sound however soothing to the player doing this can be disturbing to ones opponent Similarly clacking a stone against another stone the board or the table or floor is also discouraged However it is permissible to emphasize select moves by striking the board more firmly than normal thus producing a sharp clack Additionally hovering ones arm over the board usually when deciding where to play is also considered rude as it obstructs the opponents view of the board Manners and etiquette are extensively discussed in The Classic of WeiQi in Thirteen Chapters a Song dynasty manual to the game Apart from the points above it also points to the need to remain calm and honorable in maintaining posture and knowing the key specialised terms such as titles of common formations Generally speaking much attention is paid to the etiquette of playing as much as to winning or actual game technique Computers and Go edit Main article Computer Go Nature of the game edit See also Go and mathematics In combinatorial game theory terms Go is a zerosum perfectinformation partisan deterministic strategy game putting it in the same class as chess draughts checkers and Reversi Othello however it differs from these in its game play Although the rules are simple the practical strategy is complex The game emphasizes the importance of balance on multiple levels and has internal tensions To secure an area of the board it is good to play moves close together however to cover the largest area one needs to spread out perhaps leaving weaknesses that can be exploited Playing too low close to the edge secures insufficient territory and influence yet playing too high far from the edge allows the opponent to invade It has been claimed that Go is the most complex game in the world due to its vast number of variations in individual games 132 Its large board and lack of restrictions allow great scope in strategy and expression of players individuality Decisions in one part of the board may be influenced by an apparently unrelated situation in a distant part of the board Plays made early in the game can shape the nature of conflict a hundred moves later The game complexity of Go is such that describing even elementary strategy fills many introductory books In fact numerical estimates show that the number of possible games of Go far exceeds the number of atoms in the observable universe nb 12 Research of go endgame by John H Conway led to the invention of the surreal numbers 133 Go also contributed to development of combinatorial game theory with Go Infinitesimals 134 being a specific example of its use in Go Software players edit Main article Computer Go Go long posed a daunting challenge to computer programmers putting forward difficult decisionmaking tasks an intractable search space and an optimal solution so complex it appears infeasible to directly approximate using a policy or value function 135 Prior to 2015 135 the best Go programs only managed to reach amateur dan level 136 On smaller 99 and 13x13 boards computer programs fared better and were able to compare to professional players Many in the field of artificial intelligence consider Go to require more elements that mimic human thought than chess 137 A finished beginners game on a 1313 board Go software can reach stronger levels on a smaller board size The reasons why computer programs had not played Go at the professional dan level prior to 2016 include 138 The number of spaces on the board is much larger over five times the number of spaces on a chess board361 vs 64 On most turns there are many more possible moves in Go than in chess Throughout most of the game the number of legal moves stays at around 150250 per turn and rarely falls below 100 in chess the average number of moves is 37 139 Because an exhaustive computer program for Go must calculate and compare every possible legal move in each ply player turn its ability to calculate the best plays is sharply reduced when there are a large number of possible moves Most computer game algorithms such as those for chess compute several moves in advance Given an average of 200 available moves through most of the game for a computer to calculate its next move by exhaustively anticipating the next four moves of each possible play two of its own and two of its opponents it would have to consider more than 320 billion 32 10 11 possible combinations To exhaustively calculate the next eight moves would require computing 512 quintillion 512 10 20 possible combinations As of March2014 update the most powerful supercomputer in the world NUDTs Tianhe2 can sustain 3386 petaflops 140 At this rate even given an exceedingly low estimate of 10 operations required to assess the value of one play of a stone Tianhe2 would require 4 hours to assess all possible combinations of the next eight moves in order to make a single play The placement of a single stone in the initial phase can affect the play of the game a hundred or more moves later A computer would have to predict this influence and it would be unworkable to attempt to exhaustively analyze the next hundred moves In capturebased games such as chess a position can often be evaluated relatively easily such as by calculating who has a material advantage or more active pieces nb 13 In Go there is often no easy way to evaluate a position 141 However a 6kyu human can evaluate a position at a glance to see which player has more territory and even beginners can estimate the score within 10 points given time to count it The number of stones on the board material advantage is only a weak indicator of the strength of a position and a territorial advantage more empty points surrounded for one player might be compensated by the opponents strong positions and influence all over the board Normally a 3dan can easily judge most of these positions As an illustration the greatest handicap normally given to a weaker opponent is 9 stones It was not until August 2008 that a computer won a game against a professional level player at this handicap It was the Mogo program which scored this first victory in an exhibition game played during the US Go Congress 142 143 By 2013 a win at the professional level of play was accomplished with a fourstone advantage 144 145 In October 2015 Google DeepMind s program AlphaGo beat Fan Hui the European Go champion and a 2 dan out of 9 dan possible professional five times out of five with no handicap on a full size 1919 board 135 AlphaGo used a fundamentally different paradigm than earlier Go programs it included very little direct instruction and mostly used deep learning where AlphaGo played itself in hundreds of millions of games such that it could measure positions more intuitively In March 2016 Google next challenged Lee Sedol a 9 dan considered the top player in the world in the early 21st century 146 to a fivegame match Leading up to the game Lee Sedol and other top professionals were confident that he would win 147 however AlphaGo defeated Lee in four of the five games 148 149 After having already lost the series by the third game Lee won the fourth game describing his win as invaluable 150 In May 2017 AlphaGo beat Ke Jie who at the time continuously held the world No 1 ranking for two years 151 152 winning each game in a threegame match during the Future of Go Summit 153 154 In October 2017 DeepMind announced a significantly stronger version called AlphaGo Zero which beat the previous version by 100 games to 0 155 Software assistance edit Main article Go software A 99 game with graphical aids Colors and markings show evaluations by the computer assistant An abundance of software is available to support players of the game This includes programs that can be used to view or edit game records and diagrams programs that allow the user to search for patterns in the games of strong players and programs that allow users to play against each other over the Internet Some web servers citation needed provide graphical aids like maps to aid learning during play These graphical aids may suggest possible next moves indicate areas of influence highlight vital stones under attack and mark stones in atari or about to be captured There are several file formats used to store game records the most popular of which is SGF short for Smart Game Format Programs used for editing game records allow the user to record not only the moves but also variations commentary and further information on the game nb 14 Electronic databases can be used to study life and death situations joseki fuseki and games by a particular player Programs are available that give players pattern searching options which allow players to research positions by searching for highlevel games in which similar situations occur Such software generally lists common followup moves that have been played by professionals and gives statistics on winloss ratio in opening situations Internetbased Go servers allow access to competition with players all over the world for realtime and turnbased games nb 15 Such servers also allow easy access to professional teaching with both teaching games and interactive game review being possible nb 16 In popular culture and science edit Apart from technical literature and study material Go and its strategies have been the subject of several works of fiction such as The Master of Go by Nobel prize winning author Yasunari Kawabata nb 17 and The Girl Who Played Go by Shan Sa Other books have used Go as a theme or minor plot device For example the novel Shibumi by Trevanian centers around the game and uses Go metaphors 156 and The Way of Go 8 Ancient Strategy Secrets for Success in Business and Life by Troy Anderson applies Go strategy to business 157 GO An Asian Paradigm for Business Strategy 158 by Miura Yasuyuki a manager with Japan Airlines 159 uses Go to describe the thinking and behavior of business men 160 Go features prominently in the Chung Kuo series of novels by David Wingrove being the favourite game of the main villain 161 The manga Japanese comic book and anime series Hikaru no Go released in Japan in 1998 had a large impact in popularizing Go among young players both in Japan andas translations were releasedabroad 162 163 Go Player is a similar animated series about young Go players that aired in China In the anime PriPara one of the main characters Sion Tōdō is a world renowned Go player but decides to retire as nobody has been able to beat her becoming an idol instead Despite this Go still features heavily in her characters personality Similarly Go has been used as a subject or plot device in film such as π A Beautiful Mind Tron Legacy and The Go Master a biopic of Go professional Go Seigen 164 nb 18 2013s Tôkyô ni kita bakari or Tokyo Newcomer portrays a Chinese foreigner Go player moving to Tokyo 165 In King Hu s wuxia film The Valiant Ones the characters are colorcoded as Go stones black or other dark shades for the Chinese white for the Japanese invaders Go boards and stones are used by the characters to keep track of soldiers prior to battle and the battles themselves are structured like a game of Go 166 Go is also featured prominently in the movie The Divine Move Go has also been featured in a number of television series Starz s science fiction thriller Counterpart for instance is rich in references the opening itself featuring developments on a Go board including applications of the games metaphors a book about life and death being displayed and Go matches accurately played relevant to the plot 167 Another example is Syfy s 12 Monkeys In the first seasons episode Atari one of the characters explains the homonymous concept using it as an analogy to the situation he was facing and his son is briefly seen playing Go later on 167 The corporation and brand Atari was named after the Go term 168 Hedge fund manager Mark Spitznagel used Go as his main investing metaphor in his investing book The Dao of Capital 169 In the endgame it can often happen that the state of the board consists of several subpositions that do not interact with the others The whole board position can then be considered as a mathematical sum or composition of the individual subpositions 170 It is this property of go endgames that led John Horton Conway to the discovery of surreal numbers 133 Occasionally the playing of Go happens in movies or videogames especially those made in Korea Rarely mistakes are made either in formations or in basics such as placing the stones inside the squares as opposed to onto the intersections This may be due to the creators not playing the game themselves and usually goes unnoticed by the audience Psychology edit A 2004 review of literature by Fernand Gobet de Voogt Retschitzki 171 shows that relatively little scientific research has been carried out on the psychology of Go compared with other traditional board games such as chess Computer Go research has shown that given the large search tree knowledge and pattern recognition are more important in Go than in other strategy games such as chess 171 A study of the effects of age on Goplaying 172 has shown that mental decline is milder with strong players than with weaker players According to the review of Gobet and colleagues the pattern of brain activity observed with techniques such as PET and fMRI does not show large differences between Go and chess On the other hand a study by Xiangchuan Chen et al 173 showed greater activation in the right hemisphere among Go players than among chess players There is some evidence to suggest a correlation between playing board games and reduced risk of Alzheimers disease and dementia 174 Game theory edit In formal game theory terms Go is a nonchance combinatorial game with perfect information Informally that means there are no dice used and decisions or moves create discrete outcome vectors rather than probability distributions the underlying math is combinatorial and all moves via single vertex analysis are visible to both players unlike some card games where some information is hidden Perfect information also implies sequenceplayers can theoretically know about all past moves Other game theoretical taxonomy elements include the facts that Go is bounded because every game must end with a victor or a tie within a finite number of moves the strategy is associative every strategy is a function of board position format is noncooperative not a team sport positions are extensible can be represented by board position trees game is zerosum player choices do not increase resources availablecolloquially rewards in the game are fixed and if one player wins the other loses and the utility function is restricted in the sense of winlose however ratings monetary rewards national and personal pride and other factors can extend utility functions but generally not to the extent of removing the winlose restriction Affine transformations can theoretically add nonzero and complex utility aspects even to two player games 175 Comparisons edit Go begins with an empty board It is focused on building from the ground up nothing to something with multiple simultaneous battles leading to a pointbased win Chess is tactical rather than strategic as the predetermined strategy is to trap one individual piece the king This comparison has also been applied to military and political history with Scott Boorman s book The Protracted Game 1969 and more recently Robert Greene s book The 48 Laws of Power 1998 exploring the strategy of the Communist Party of China in the Chinese Civil War through the lens of Go 176 177 A similar comparison has been drawn among Go chess and backgammon perhaps the three oldest games that enjoy worldwide popularity 178 Backgammon is a man vs fate contest with chance playing a strong role in determining the outcome Chess with rows of soldiers marching forward to capture each other embodies the conflict of man vs man Because the handicap system tells Go players where they stand relative to other players an honestly ranked player can expect to lose about half of their games therefore Go can be seen as embodying the quest for selfimprovement man vs self 178 See also edit China

life position can be found on Senseis Library it also appears in the official text for Japanese Rules see translation Roughly one has the time to play the game and then a little time to finish it off Timewasting tactics are possible in Go so that sudden death systems in which time runs out at a predetermined point however many plays are in the game are relatively unpopular in the West Literally in Japanese byōyomi means reading of seconds Typically players stop the clock and the player in overtime sets hisher clock for the desired interval counts out the required number of stones and sets the remaining stones out of reach so as not to become confused If twenty moves are made in time the timer is reset to five minutes again In other words Canadian byoyomi is essentially a standard chessstyle time control based on N moves in a time period T imposed after a main period is used up It is possible to decrease T or increase N as each overtime period expires but systems with constant T and N for example 20 plays in 5minutes are widely used Kaku Takagawa toured Europe around 1970 and reported Go Review a general standard of amateur 4 dan This is a good amateur level but no more
