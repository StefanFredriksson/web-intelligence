a problem the problem is no longer considered by the public to be a part of AI This phenomenon has occurred in relation to every AI application produced so far throughout the history of development of AI AI winter GOFAI History of machine learning timeline History of machine translation timeline Moores Law observation that over the history of computing hardware the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years One way this relates to AI is that hypothetically a computer would need at least as much capacity as a human brain to be able to be programmed to be as smart as a human So as long as the aforementioned rate of development met or beat the 2year doubling time one could roughly forecast when a computer would have as much memory and calculation capacity as a human brain a milestone which was reached in 2010 Though it may take as much as 3 magnitudes 1000 times more computer capacity since computers calculate things in a much more linear fashion to emulate the massively parallel structure of the human brain At a doubling time of 2 years an increase in capacity by 1000fold would take a little less than 18 years 9 doublings if reaching the limit of integrated circuit technology did not pose an obstacle before then History of natural language processing History of optical character recognition timeline AI hazards and safety edit Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence as a global catastrophic risk AI takeover point at which humans are no longer the dominant form of intelligence on Earth and machine intelligence is Intelligence explosion through recursive selfimprovement and selfreplication the magnitude of intelligent machinery could achieve superintelligence surpassing human ability to resist it Superintelligence AI may grow to such an advanced state to become as proportionately superior to humans as humans are to ants Theoretically there would be little humans could do to prevent such an intelligence from reaching its goals Weaponization of artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence arms race competition between two or more states to have its military forces equipped with the best artificial intelligence AI Lethal autonomous weapon Military robot Unmanned combat aerial vehicle Friendly AI hypothetical AI that is designed not to harm humans and to prevent unfriendly AI from being developed AI and the future edit Artificial general intelligence Strong AI hypothetical artificial intelligence that matches or exceeds human intelligence an intelligent machine that could perform intellectual tasks at least as well as a human Aspects or features Selfreplicating machines smart computers and robots would be able to make more of themselves in a geometric progression or via mass production Or smart programs may be uploaded into hardware existing at the time because linear architecture of sufficient speeds could be used to emulate massively parallel analog systems such as human brains Recursive self improvement aka seed AI speculative ability of strong artificial intelligence to reprogram itself to make itself even more intelligent The more intelligent it got the more capable it would be of further improving itself in successively more rapid iterations potentially resulting in an intelligence explosion leading to the emergence of a superintelligence Hive mind Robot swarm Technological singularity the development of strong AI may cause an intelligence explosion in which greaterthanhuman intelligence emerges radically changing civilization and perhaps even human nature The TS has been identified by Berglas 2012 and others to be an existential risk Singularitarianism Human enhancement humans may be enhanced either by the efforts of AI or by merging with it Transhumanism philosophy of human transformation Posthumanism people may survive but not be recognizable in comparison to present modernday humans Cyborgs Mind
