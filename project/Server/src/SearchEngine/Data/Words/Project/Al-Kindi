mathematician physician and musician AlKindi was the first of the Islamic peripatetic philosophers and is hailed as the father of Arab philosophy 8 9 10 AlKindi was born in Kufa and educated in Baghdad 11 He became a prominent figure in the House of Wisdom and a number of Abbasid Caliphs appointed him to oversee the translation of Greek scientific and philosophical texts into the Arabic language This contact with the philosophy of the ancients as Hellenistic philosophy was often referred to by Muslim scholars had a profound effect on him as he synthesized adapted and promoted Hellenistic and Peripatetic philosophy in the Muslim world 12 He subsequently wrote hundreds of original treatises of his own on a range of subjects ranging from metaphysics ethics logic and psychology to medicine pharmacology 13 mathematics astronomy astrology and optics and further afield to more practical topics like perfumes swords jewels glass dyes zoology tides mirrors meteorology and earthquakes 14 15 In the field of mathematics alKindi played an important role in introducing Indian numerals to the Islamic world and subsequently the Arabic numerals to the Christian world along with AlKhwarizmi 16 AlKindi was also one of the fathers of cryptography 17 18 Building on the work of AlKhalil 717786 19 AlKindis book entitled Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages gave rise to the birth of cryptanalysis was the earliest known use of statistical inference 20 and introduced several new methods of breaking ciphers notably frequency analysis 21 22 Using his mathematical and medical expertise he was able to develop a scale that would allow doctors to quantify the potency of their medication 23 The central theme underpinning alKindis philosophical writings is the compatibility between philosophy and other orthodox Islamic sciences particularly theology And many of his works deal with subjects that theology had an immediate interest in These include the nature of God the soul and prophetic knowledge 24 But despite the important role he played in making philosophy accessible to Muslim intellectuals his own philosophical output was largely overshadowed by that of alFarabi and very few of his texts are available for modern scholars to examine Contents 1 Early life 2 Accomplishments 21 Philosophy 22 Astronomy 23 Optics 24 Medicine 25 Chemistry 26

family of the Kinda tribe descended from the chieftain alAshath ibn Qays a contemporary of Muhammad 25 The family belonged to the most prominent families of the tribal nobility of Kufa in the early Islamic period until it lost much of its power following the revolt of Abd alRahman ibn Muhammad ibn alAshath 26 His father Ishaq was the governor of Kufa and alKindi received his preliminary education there He later went to complete his studies in Baghdad where he was patronized by the Abbasid caliphs alMamun ruled 813833 and alMutasim r 833842 On account of his learning and aptitude for study alMamun appointed him to the House of Wisdom a recently established centre for the translation of Greek philosophical and scientific texts in Baghdad He was also well known for his beautiful calligraphy and at one point was employed as a calligrapher by alMutawakkil 27 When alMamun died his brother alMutasim became Caliph AlKindis position would be enhanced under alMutasim who appointed him as a tutor to his son But on the accession of alWāthiq r 842847 and especially of alMutawakkil r 847861 alKindis star waned There are various theories concerning this some attribute alKindis downfall to scholarly rivalries at the House of Wisdom others refer to alMutawakkils often violent persecution of unorthodox Muslims as well as of nonMuslims at one point alKindi was beaten and his library temporarily confiscated Henry Corbin an authority on Islamic studies says that in 873 alKindi died a lonely man in Baghdad during the reign of alMutamid r 870892 27 After his death alKindis philosophical works quickly fell into obscurity and many of them were lost even to later Islamic scholars and historians Felix KleinFranke suggests a number of reasons for this aside from the militant orthodoxy of alMutawakkil the Mongols also destroyed countless libraries during their invasion However he says the most probable cause of this was that his writings never found popularity amongst subsequent influential philosophers such as alFarabi and Avicenna who ultimately overshadowed him 28 Accomplishments edit According to Ibn alNadim alKindi wrote at least two hundred and sixty books contributing heavily to geometry thirtytwo books medicine and philosophy twentytwo books each logic nine books and physics twelve books 29 Although most of his books have been lost over the centuries a few have survived in the form of Latin translations by Gerard of Cremona and others have been rediscovered in Arabic manuscripts most importantly twentyfour of his lost works were located in the midtwentieth century in a Turkish library 30 Philosophy edit His greatest contribution to the development of Islamic philosophy was his efforts to make Greek thought both accessible and acceptable to a Muslim audience AlKindi carried out this mission from the House of Wisdom Bayt alHikma an institute of translation and learning patronized by the Abbasid Caliphs in Baghdad 27 As well as translating many important texts much of what was to become standard Arabic philosophical vocabulary originated with alKindi indeed if it had not been for him the work of philosophers like AlFarabi Avicenna and alGhazali might not have been possible 31 In his writings one of alKindis central concerns was to demonstrate the compatibility between philosophy and natural theology on the one hand and revealed or speculative theology on the other though in fact he rejected speculative theology Despite this he did make clear that he believed revelation was a superior source of knowledge to reason because it guaranteed matters of faith that reason could not uncover And while his philosophical approach was not always original and was even considered clumsy by later thinkers mainly because he was the first philosopher writing in the Arabic language he successfully incorporated Aristotelian and especially neoPlatonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world 32 Astronomy edit AlKindi took his view of the solar system from Ptolemy who placed the Earth at the centre of a series of concentric spheres in which the known heavenly bodies the Moon Mercury Venus the Sun Mars Jupiter and the stars are embedded In one of his treatises on the subject he says that these bodies are rational entities whose circular motion is in obedience to and worship of God Their role alKindi believes is to act as instruments for divine providence He furnishes empirical evidence as proof for this assertion different seasons are marked by particular arrangements of the planets and stars most notably the sun the appearance and manner of people varies according to the arrangement of heavenly bodies situated above their homeland 33 However he is ambiguous when it comes to the actual process by which the heavenly bodies affect the material world One theory he posits in his works is from Aristotle who conceived that the movement of these bodies causes friction in the sublunar region which stirs up the primary elements of earth fire air and water and these combine to produce everything in the material world An alternative view found his treatise On Rays is that the planets exercise their influence in straight lines In each of these he presents two fundamentally different views of physical interaction action by contact and action at a distance This dichotomy is duplicated in his writings on optics 34 Some of the notable astrological works by alKindi include 35 The Book of the Judgement of the Stars including The Forty Chapters on questions and elections On the Stellar Rays Several epistles on weather and meteorology including De mutatione temporum On the Changing of the Weather Treatise on the Judgement of Eclipses Treatise on the Dominion of the Arabs and its Duration used to predict the end of Arab rule The Choices of Days on elections On the Revolutions of the Years on mundane astrology and natal revolutions De Signis Astronomiae Applicitis as Mediciam On the Signs of Astronomy as applied to Medicine Treatise on the Spirituality of the Planets Optics edit De radiis manuscript 17th century Cambridge Trinity College Library Medieval manuscripts MS R1517 937 AlKindi was the first major writer on optics since antiquity Roger Bacon placed him in the first rank after Ptolemy as a writer on the topic 36 In a work known in the west as De radiis stellarum alKindi developed a theory that everything in the world emits rays in every direction which fill the whole world 37 This theory of the active power of rays had an influence on later scholars such as Ibn alHaytham Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon 38 Two major theories of optics appear in the writings of alKindi Aristotelian and Euclidean Aristotle had believed that in order for the eye to perceive an object both the eye and the object must be in contact with a transparent medium such as air that is filled with light When these criteria are met the sensible form of the object is transmitted through the medium to the eye On the other hand Euclid proposed that vision occurred in straight lines when rays from the eye reached an illuminated object and were reflected back As with his theories on Astrology the dichotomy of contact and distance is present in alKindis writings on this subject as well The factor which alKindi relied upon to determine which of these theories was most correct was how adequately each one explained the experience of seeing For example Aristotles theory was unable to account for why the angle at which an individual sees an object affects his perception of it For example why a circle viewed from the side will appear as a line According to Aristotle the complete sensible form of a circle should be transmitted to the eye and it should appear as a circle On the other hand Euclidean optics provided a geometric model that was able to account for this as well as the length of shadows and reflections in mirrors because Euclid believed that the visual rays could only travel in straight lines something which is commonly accepted in modern science For this reason alKindi considered the latter preponderant 39 AlKindis primary optical treatise De aspectibus was later translated into Latin This work along with Alhazen s Optics and the Arabic translations of Ptolemy and Euclids Optics were the main Arabic texts to affect the development of optical investigations in Europe most notably those of Robert Grosseteste Vitello and Roger Bacon 40 Medicine edit There are more than thirty treatises attributed to alKindi in the field of medicine in which he was chiefly influenced by the ideas of Galen 41 His most important work in this field is probably De Gradibus in which he demonstrates the application of mathematics to medicine particularly in the field of pharmacology For example he developed a mathematical scale to quantify the strength of drug and a system based the phases of the moon that would allow a doctor to determine in advance the most critical days of a patients illness 23 According to Plinio Prioreschi this was the first attempt at serious quantification in medicine 42 Chemistry edit As an advanced chemist AlKindi was also an opponent of alchemy he debunked the myth that simple base metals could be transformed into precious metals such as gold or silver 43 AlKindi unambiguously described the distillation of wine 44 45 In a book titled as Kitab alTaraffuq fi alitr The Book of the chemistry of Perfume and distillations he says after describing the method and apparatus needed for distillation In this way one can distill wine using a waterbath and it comes out the same color as rosewater 46 Also in the same book he describes the distillation process for extracting rose oils and provides the recipes for 107 different kinds of perfumes 47 Mathematics edit AlKindi authored works on a number of important mathematical subjects including arithmetic geometry the Indian numbers the harmony of numbers lines and multiplication with numbers relative quantities measuring proportion and time and numerical procedures and cancellation 16 He also wrote four volumes On the Use of the Indian Numerals Ketab fi Istimal alAdad alHindi which contributed greatly to diffusion of the Indian system of numeration in the MiddleEast and the West In geometry among other works he wrote on the theory of parallels Also related to geometry were two works on optics One of the ways in which he made use of mathematics as a philosopher was to attempt to disprove the eternity of the world by demonstrating that actual infinity is a mathematical and logical absurdity 48 Cryptography edit The first page of alKindis manuscript On Deciphering Cryptographic Messages containing the oldest known description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis AlKindi is credited with developing a method whereby variations in the frequency of the occurrence of letters could be analyzed and exploited to break ciphers ie cryptanalysis by frequency analysis 22 His book on this topic is Risāla fī Istikhrāj alKutub alMuammāh رسالة في استخراج الكتب المعماة literally On Extracting Obscured Correspondence more contemporary On Decrypting Encrypted Correspondence In his treatise on cryptanalysis he wrote One way to solve an encrypted message if we know its language is to find a different plaintext of the same language long enough to fill one sheet or so and then we count the occurrences of each letter We call the most frequently occurring letter the first the next most occurring letter the second the following most occurring letter the third and so on until we account for all the different letters in the plaintext sample Then we look at the cipher text we want to solve and we also classify its symbols We find the most occurring symbol and change it to the form of the first letter of the plaintext sample the next most common symbol is changed to the form of the second letter and the following most common symbol is changed to the form of the third letter and so on until we account for all symbols of the cryptogram we want to solve 49 AlKindi was influenced by the work of AlKhalil 717786 who wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels 19 Meteorology edit In a treatise entitled as Risala fi lIlla alFailali lMadd wa lFazr Treatise on the Efficient Cause of the Flow and Ebb AlKindi presents a theory on tides which depends on the changes which take place in bodies owing to the rise and fall of temperature 50 In order to support his argument he gave a description of a scientific experiment as follows One can also observe by the senses how in consequence of extreme cold air changes into water To do this one takes a glass bottle fills it completely with snow and closes its end carefully Then one determines its weight by weighing One places it in a container which has previously been weighed On the surface of the bottle the air changes into water and appears upon it like the drops on large porous pitchers so that a considerable amount of water gradually collects inside the container One then weighs the bottle the water and the container and finds their weight greater than previously which proves the change Some foolish persons are of opinion that the snow exudes through the glass This is impossible There is no process by which water or snow can be made to pass through glass In explaining the natural cause of the wind and the difference for its directions based on time and location he wrote 51 When the sun is in its northern declination northerly places will heat up and it will be cold towards the south Then the northern air will expand in a southerly direction because of the heat due to the contraction of the southern air Therefore most of the summer winds are merits and most of the winter winds are not Music theory edit AlKindi was the first great theoretician of music in the ArabIslamic world He is known to have written fifteen treatises on music theory but only five have survived He added a fifth string to the ud 52 His works included discussions on the therapeutic value of music 53 and what he regarded as cosmological connections of music 54 Philosophical thought edit Influences edit While Muslim intellectuals were already acquainted with Greek philosophy especially logic alKindi is credited with being the first real Muslim philosopher 12 His own thought was largely influenced by the NeoPlatonic philosophy of Proclus Plotinus and John Philoponus amongst others although he does appear to have borrowed ideas from other Hellenistic schools as well 55 He makes many references to Aristotle in his writings but these are often unwittingly reinterpreted in a NeoPlatonic framework This trend is most obvious in areas such as metaphysics and the nature of God as a causal entity 56 Earlier experts had suggested that he was influenced by the Mutazilite school of theology because of the mutual concern both he and they demonstrated for maintaining the singularity tawhid of God However such agreements are now considered incidental as further study has shown that they disagreed on a number of equally important topics 57 Metaphysics edit According to alKindi the goal of metaphysics is knowledge of God For this reason he does not make a clear distinction between philosophy and theology because he believes they are both concerned with the same subject Later philosophers particularly alFarabi and Avicenna would strongly disagree with him on this issue by saying that metaphysics is actually concerned with being qua being and as such the nature of God is purely incidental 24 Central to alKindis understanding of metaphysics is Gods absolute oneness which he considers an attribute uniquely associated with God and therefore not shared with anything else By this he means that while we may think of any existent thing as being one it is in fact both one and many For example he says that while a body is one it is also composed of many different parts A person might say I see an elephant by which he means I see one elephant but the term elephant refers to a species of animal that contains many Therefore only God is absolutely one both in being and in concept lacking any multiplicity whatsoever Some feel this understanding entails a very rigorous negative theology because it implies that any description which can be predicated to anything else cannot be said about God 57 58 In addition to absolute oneness alKindi also described God as the Creator This means that He acts as both a final and efficient cause Unlike later Muslim NeoPlatonic philosophers who asserted that the universe existed as a result of Gods existence overflowing which is a passive act alKindi conceived of God as an active agent In fact of God as the agent because all other intermediary agencies are contingent upon Him 59 The key idea here is that God acts through created intermediaries which in turn act on one another through a chain of cause and effect to produce the desired result In reality these intermediary agents do not act at all they are merely a conduit for Gods own action 56 This is especially significant in the development of Islamic philosophy as it portrayed the first cause and unmoved mover of Aristotelian philosophy as compatible with the concept of God according to Islamic revelation 60 Epistemology edit Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle were highly respected in the medieval Islamic world AlKindi theorized that there was a separate incorporeal and universal intellect known as the First Intellect It was the first of Gods creation and the intermediary through which all other things came into creation Aside from its obvious metaphysical importance it was also crucial to alKindis epistemology which was influenced by Platonic realism 61 According to Plato everything that exists in the material world corresponds to certain universal forms in the heavenly realm These forms are really abstract concepts such as a species quality or relation which apply to all physical objects and beings For example a red apple has the quality of redness derived from the appropriate universal However alKindi says that human intellects are only potentially able to comprehend these This potential is actualized by the First Intellect which is perpetually thinking about all of the universals He argues that the external agency of this intellect is necessary by saying that human beings cannot arrive at a universal concept merely through perception In other words an intellect cannot understand the species of a thing simply by examining one or more of its instances According to him this will only yield an inferior sensible form and not the universal form which we desire The universal form can only be attained through contemplation and actualization by the First Intellect 62 The analogy he provides to explain his theory is that of wood and fire Wood he argues is potentially hot just as a human is potentially thinking about a universal and therefore requires something else which is already hot such as fire to actualize this This means that for the human intellect to think about something the First Intellect must already be thinking about it Therefore he says that the First Intellect must always be thinking about everything Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process it becomes part of the individuals acquired intellect and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes 63 The soul and the afterlife edit AlKindi says that the soul is a simple immaterial substance which is related to the material world only because of its faculties which operate through the physical body To explain the nature of our worldly existence he borrowing from Epictetus compares it to a ship which has during the course of its ocean voyage temporarily anchored itself at an island and allowed its passengers to disembark The implicit warning is that those passengers who linger too long on the island may be left behind when the ship sets sail again Here alKindi displays a stoic concept that we must not become attached to material things represented by the island as they will invariably be taken away from us when the ship sets sail again He then connects this with a NeoPlatonist idea by saying that our soul can be directed towards the pursuit of desire or the pursuit of intellect the former will tie it to the body so that when the body dies it will also die but the latter will free it from the body and allow it to survive in the light of the Creator in a realm of pure intelligence 64 The relationship between revelation and philosophy edit In the view of alKindi prophecy and philosophy were two different routes to arrive at the truth He contrasts the two positions in four ways Firstly while a person must undergo a long period of training and study to become a philosopher prophecy is bestowed upon someone by God Secondly the philosopher must arrive at the truth by his own devices and with great difficulty whereas the prophet has the truth revealed to him by God Thirdly the understanding of the prophet being divinely revealed is clearer and more comprehensive than that of the philosopher Fourthly the way in which the prophet is able to express this understanding to the ordinary people is superior Therefore alKindi says the prophet is superior in two fields the ease and certainty with which he receives the truth and the way in which he presents it However the crucial implication is that the content of the prophets and the philosophers knowledge is the same This says Adamson demonstrates how limited the superiority alKindi afforded to prophecy was 65 66 In addition to this alKindi adopted a naturalistic view of prophetic visions He argued that through the faculty of imagination as conceived of in Aristotelian philosophy certain pure and wellprepared souls were able to receive information about future events Significantly he does not attribute such visions or dreams to revelation from God but instead explains that imagination enables human beings to receive the form of something without needing to perceive the physical entity to which it refers Therefore it would seem to imply that anyone who has purified themselves would be able to receive such visions It is precisely this idea amongst other naturalistic explanations of prophetic miracles that alGhazali attacks in his Incoherence of the Philosophers 67 Critics and patrons edit While alKindi appreciated the usefulness of philosophy in answering questions of a religious nature there would be many Islamic thinkers who were not as enthusiastic about its potential But it would be incorrect to assume that they opposed philosophy simply because it was a foreign science Oliver Leaman an expert on Islamic philosophy points out that the objections of notable theologians are rarely directed at philosophy itself but rather at the conclusions the philosophers arrived at Even alGhazali who is famous for his critique of the philosophers was himself an expert in philosophy and logic And his criticism was that they arrived at theologically erroneous conclusions The three most serious of these in his view were believing in the coeternity of the universe with God denying the bodily resurrection and asserting that God only has knowledge of abstract universals not of particular things not all philosophers subscribed to these same views 68 During his life alKindi was fortunate enough to enjoy the patronage of the pro Mutazilite Caliphs alMamun and alMutasim which meant he could carry out his philosophical speculations with relative ease In his own time alKindi would be criticized for extolling the intellect as being the most immanent creation in proximity to God which was commonly held to be the position of the angels 69 He also engaged in disputations with the Mutazilites whom he attacked for their belief in atoms 70 But the real role of alKindi in the conflict between philosophers and theologians would be to prepare the ground for debate His works says Deborah Black contained all the seeds of future controversy that would be fully realized in alGhazalis Incoherence of the Philosophers 71 Legacy edit AlKindi was a master of many different areas of thought and was held to be one of the greatest Islamic philosophers of his time His influence in the fields of physics mathematics medicine philosophy and music were farreaching and lasted for several centuries Ibn alNadim in his alFihrist praised AlKindi and his work stating The best man of his time unique in his knowledge of all the ancient sciences He is called the Philosopher of the Arabs His books deal with different sciences such as logic philosophy geometry arithmetic astronomy etc We have connected him with the natural philosophers because of his prominence in Science 72 AlKindi major contribution was his establishment of philosophy in the Islamic world and his efforts in trying to harmonize the philosophical investigation along with the Islamic theology and creed The philosophical texts which were translated under his supervision would become the standard texts in the Islamic world for centuries to come even after his influence has been eclipsed by later Philosophers 73 AlKindi was also an important figure in medieval Europe Several of his books got translated into Latin influencing western authors like Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon The Italian Renaissance scholar Geralomo Cardano 15011575 considered him as one of the twelve greatest minds 74 References edit KleinFrank F AlKindi In Leaman O Nasr H 2001 History of Islamic Philosophy London Routledge p 165 Adamson 2007 p1213 Leaman Oliver 16 July
