Unified Modeling Language The Unified Modeling Language UML is a generalpurpose developmental modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system 1 The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design It was developed by Grady Booch Ivar Jacobson and James Rumbaugh at Rational Software in 19941995 with further development led by them through 1996 1 In 1997 UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group OMG and has been managed by this organization ever since In 2005 UML was also published by the International Organization for Standardization ISO as an approved ISO standard 2 Since then the standard has been periodically revised to cover the latest revision of UML 3 Contents 1 History 11 Before UML 10 12 UML 1x 121 Cardinality notation 13 UML 2 2 Design 21 Software development methods 22 Modeling

objectoriented methods and notation Before UML 10 edit UML has been evolving since the second half of the 1990s and has its roots in the objectoriented programming methods developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s The timeline see image shows the highlights of the history of objectoriented modeling methods and notation It is originally based on the notations of the Booch method the objectmodeling technique OMT and objectoriented software engineering OOSE which it has integrated into a single language 4 Rational Software Corporation hired James Rumbaugh from General Electric in 1994 and after that the company became the source for two of the most popular objectoriented modeling approaches of the day 5 Rumbaughs objectmodeling technique OMT and Grady Booch s method They were soon assisted in their efforts by Ivar Jacobson the creator of the objectoriented software engineering OOSE method who joined them at Rational in 1995 1 UML 1x edit Under the technical leadership of those three Rumbaugh Jacobson and Booch a consortium called the UML Partners was organized in 1996 to complete the Unified Modeling Language UML specification and propose it to the Object Management Group OMG for standardisation The partnership also contained additional interested parties for example HP DEC IBM and Microsoft The UML Partners UML 10 draft was proposed to the OMG in January 1997 by the consortium During the same month the UML Partners formed a group designed to define the exact meaning of language constructs chaired by Cris Kobryn and administered by Ed Eykholt to finalize the specification and integrate it with other standardization efforts The result of this work UML 11 was submitted to the OMG in August 1997 and adopted by the OMG in November 1997 1 6 After the first release a task force was formed 1 to improve the language which released several minor revisions 13 14 and 15 7 The standards it produced as well as the original standard have been noted as being ambiguous and inconsistent 8 9 Cardinality notation edit As with database Chen Bachman and ISO ER diagrams class models are specified to use lookacross cardinalities even though several authors Merise 10 Elmasri Navathe 11 amongst others 12 prefer sameside or lookhere for roles and both minimum and maximum cardinalities Recent researchers Feinerer 13 Dullea et al 14 have shown that the lookacross technique used by UML and ER diagrams is less effective and less coherent when applied to n ary relationships of order strictly greater than 2 Feinerer says Problems arise if we operate under the lookacross semantics as used for UML associations Hartmann 15 investigates this situation and shows how and why different transformations fail and As we will see on the next few pages the lookacross interpretation introduces several difficulties which prevent the extension of simple mechanisms from binary to n ary associations UML 2 edit UML 20 major revision replaced version 15 in 2005 which was developed with an enlarged consortium to improve the language further to reflect new experience on usage of its features 16 Although UML 21 was never released as a formal specification versions 211 and 212 appeared in 2007 followed by UML 22 in February 2009 UML 23 was formally released in May 2010 17 UML 241 was formally released in August 2011 17 UML 25 was released in October 2012 as an In progress version and was officially released in June 2015 17 Formal version 251 was adopted in December 2017 18 There are four parts to the UML 2x specification The Superstructure that defines the notation and semantics for diagrams and their model elements The Infrastructure that defines the core metamodel on which the Superstructure is based The Object Constraint Language OCL for defining rules for model elements The UML Diagram Interchange that defines how UML 2 diagram layouts are exchanged The current versions of these standards are 19 UML Superstructure version 241 UML Infrastructure version 241 OCL version 231 UML Diagram Interchange version 10 It continues to be updated and improved by the revision task force who resolve any issues with the language 20 Design edit UML offers a way to visualize a systems architectural blueprints in a diagram including elements such as 4 any activities jobs individual components of the system and how they can interact with other software components how the system will run how entities interact with others components and interfaces external user interface Although originally intended for objectoriented design documentation UML has been extended to a larger set of design documentation as listed above 21 and been found useful in many contexts 22 Software development methods edit UML is not a development method by itself 23 however it was designed to be compatible with the leading objectoriented software development methods of its time for example OMT Booch method Objectory and especially RUP that it was originally intended to be used with when work began at Rational Software Modeling edit It is important to distinguish between the UML model and the set of diagrams of a system A diagram is a partial graphic representation of a systems model The set of diagrams need not completely cover the model and deleting a diagram does not change the model The model may also contain documentation that drives the model elements and diagrams such as written use cases UML diagrams represent two different views of a system model 24 Static or structural view emphasizes the static structure of the system using objects attributes operations and relationships It includes class diagrams and composite structure diagrams Dynamic or behavioral view emphasizes the dynamic behavior of the system by showing collaborations among objects and changes to the internal states of objects This view includes sequence diagrams activity diagrams and state machine diagrams UML models can be exchanged among UML tools by using the XML Metadata Interchange XMI format In UML one of the key tools for behavior modelling is the usecase model caused by OOSE Use cases are a way of specifying required usages of a system Typically they are used to capture the requirements of a system that is what a system is supposed to do 25 Diagrams edit UML diagram types Structural UML diagrams Class diagram Component diagram Composite structure diagram Deployment diagram Object diagram Package diagram Profile diagram Behavioral UML diagrams Activity diagram Communication diagram Interaction overview diagram Sequence diagram State diagram Timing diagram Use case diagram v t e UML 2 has many types of diagrams which are divided into two categories 4 Some types represent structural information and the rest represent general types of behavior including a few that represent different aspects of interactions These diagrams can be categorized hierarchically as shown in the following class diagram 4 These diagrams may all contain comments or notes explaining usage constraint or intent Structure diagrams edit Structure diagrams emphasize the things that must be present in the system being modeled Since structure diagrams represent the structure they are used extensively in documenting the software architecture of software systems For example the component diagram describes how a software system is split up into components and shows the dependencies among these components Component diagram Class diagram Behavior diagrams edit Behavior diagrams emphasize what must happen in the system being modeled Since behavior diagrams illustrate the behavior of a system they are used extensively to describe the functionality of software systems As an example the activity diagram describes the business and operational stepbystep activities of the components in a system Activity diagram Use case diagram Interaction diagrams edit Interaction diagrams a subset of behavior diagrams emphasize the flow of control and data among the things in the system being modeled For example the sequence diagram shows how objects communicate with each other regarding a sequence of messages Sequence diagram Communication diagram Metamodeling edit Main article MetaObject Facility Illustration of the MetaObject Facility The Object Management Group OMG has developed a metamodeling architecture to define the UML called the MetaObject Facility 26 MOF is designed as a fourlayered architecture as shown in the image at right It provides a metameta model at the top called the M3 layer This M3model is the language used by MetaObject Facility to build metamodels called M2models The most prominent example of a Layer 2 MetaObject Facility model is the UML metamodel which describes the UML itself These M2models describe elements of the M1layer and thus M1models These would be for example models written in UML The last layer is the M0layer or data layer It is used to describe runtime instances of the system 27 The metamodel can be extended using a mechanism called stereotyping This has been criticised as being insufficientuntenable by Brian HendersonSellers and Cesar GonzalezPerez in Uses and Abuses of the Stereotype Mechanism in UML 1x and 20 28 Adoption edit UML has been marketed for many contexts 22 29 It has been treated at times as a design silver bullet which leads to problems UML misuse includes overuse designing every part of the system with it which is unnecessary and assuming that novices can design with it 30 It is considered a large language with many constructs Some people including Jacobson feel that UMLs size hinders learning and therefore using it 31 See also edit Applications of UML Business Process Model and Notation BPMN Modelbased testing Modeldriven
