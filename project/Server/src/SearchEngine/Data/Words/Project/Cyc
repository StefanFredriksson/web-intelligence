in Lisp CycL Type Ontology and Knowledge Base and Knowledge Representation Language and Inference engine Website www cyc com Cyc pronounced SYKE ˈ s aɪ k is a longliving artificial intelligence project that aims to assemble a comprehensive ontology and knowledge base that spans the basic concepts and rules about how the world works Hoping to capture common sense knowledge Cyc focuses on implicit knowledge that other AI platforms may take for granted This is contrasted with facts one might find somewhere on the internet or retrieve via a search engine or Wikipedia Cyc enables AI applications to perform humanlike reasoning and be less brittle when confronted with novel situations Douglas Lenat began the project in July 1984 at MCC where he was Principal Scientist 19841994 and then since January 1995 has been under active development by the Cycorp company where he is the CEO Contents 1 Overview 2 Knowledge base 3 Inference engine 4 Releases 41 OpenCyc 42 ResearchCyc 5

Further reading 11 External links Overview edit The need for a massive symbolic artificial intelligence project of this kind was born in the early 1980s Early AI researchers had ample experience over the previous 25 years with AI programs that would generate encouraging early results but then fail to scale upmove beyond the training set to tackle a broader range of cases Douglas Lenat and Alan Kay publicized this need 1 2 3 and they organized a meeting at Stanford in 1983 to address the problem The backoftheenvelope calculations by Doug Alan and their colleagues including Marvin Minsky Allen Newell Edward Feigenbaum and John McCarthy indicated that that effort would require between 1000 and 3000 personyears of effort far beyond the standard academic project model However events within a year of that meeting enabled an effort of that scale to get underway The project began in July 1984 as the flagship project of the 400person Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation MCC a research consortium started by two dozen large United States based corporations to counter a then ominous Japanese effort in AI the socalled fifthgeneration project 4 The US Government reacted to the Fifth Generation threat by passing the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 which for the first time allowed US companies to collude on longterm highrisk highpayoff research and MCC and Sematech sprang up to take advantage of that tenyear opportunity MCCs first President and CEO was Bobby Ray Inman former NSA Director and Central Intelligence Agency deputy director The objective of the Cyc project was to codify in machineusable form the millions of pieces of knowledge that compose human common sense 5 This entailed along the way 1 developing an adequately expressive representation language CycL 6 2 developing an ontology spanning all human concepts down to some appropriate level of detail 7 3 developing a knowledge base on that ontological framework 7 comprising all human knowledge about those concepts down to some appropriate level of detail and 4 developing an inference engine exponentially faster than those used in thenconventional expert systems 8 9 to be able to infer the same types and depth of conclusions that humans are capable of given their knowledge of the world In slightly more detail The CycL representation language started as an extension of RLL 10 11 the socalled Representation Language Language developed in 19791980 by Professor Douglas Lenat at Stanford University and his graduate student Russell Greiner but within a few years of the launch of the Cyc project it became clear that even representing a typical news story or novel or advertisement would require more than the expressive power of full first order logic namely second order predicate calculus What is the relationship between rain and water and then even higherlevel orders of logic including modal logic reflection enabling the system to reason about its progress so far on a problem on which its working and context logic enabling the system to reason explicitly about the contexts in which its various premises and conclusions might hold nonmonotonic logic and circumscription By 1989 6 CycL had expanded in expressive power to Higher Order Logic HOL Triplestore representations which are akin to the Frame andslot representation languages of the 1970s from which RLL sprang are widespread today in AI It may be useful to cite a few examples that stress or break that type of representation typical of the examples that forced the Cyc project to move from a triplestore representation to a much more expressive one during the period 19841989 6 English sentences including negations Fred does not own a dog nested quantifiers Every American has a mother means forall x thereexists y but Every American has a President means thereexists y such that forall x nested modals such as The United States believes that Germany wants NATO to avoid pursuing and its even awkward to represent in a Triplestore relationships of arity higher than 2 such as Los Angeles is between San Diego and San Francisco along US101 Cycs ontology grew to about 100000 terms during the first decade of the project to 1994 and as of 2017 contained about 1500000 terms This ontology included 416000 collections types sorts natural kind s which includes both types of things such as Fish and types of actions such as Fishing a little over a million individuals representing 42500 predicate s relations attributes fields properties functions about a million generally well known entities such as TheUnitedStatesOfAmerica BarackObama TheSigningOfTheUSDeclarationOfIndependence etc An arbitrarily large number of additional terms are also implicitly present in the Cyc ontology in the sense that there are termdenoting functions such as CalendarYearFn when given the argument 2016 it denotes the calendar year 2016 GovernmentFn when given the argument France it denotes the government of France Meter when given the argument 2016 it denotes a distance of 2016 kilometers and nestings and compositions of such functiondenoting terms The Cyc knowledge base of general commonsense rules and assertions involving those ontological terms was largely created by hand axiomwriting it grew to about 1 million in 1994 and as of 2017 is about 245 million and has taken well over 1000 personyears of effort to construct It is important to understand that the Cyc ontological engineers strive to keep those numbers as small as possible not inflate them so long as the deductive closure of the knowledge base isnt reduced Suppose Cyc is told about one billion individual people animals etc Then it could be told 10 18 facts of the form Mickey Mouse is not the same individual as Bullwinkle the MooseAbraham LincolnJennifer Lopez But instead of that one could tell Cyc 10000 Linnaean Taxonomy rules followed by just 10 8 rules of the form No mouse is a moose And even more compactly Cyc could instead just be given those 10000 Linnaean Taxonomy rules followed by just one rule of the form For any two Linnaean taxons if neither is explicitly known to be a supertaxon of the other then they are disjoint Those 10001 assertions have the same deductive closure as the earliermentioned 10 18 facts The Cyc inference engine design separates the epistemological problem what content should be in the Cyc KB from the heuristic problem how Cyc could efficiently infer arguments hundreds of steps deep in a sea of tens of millions of axioms To do the former the CycL language and wellunderstood logical inference might suffice For the latter Cyc used a communityofagents architecture where specialized reasoning modules each with its own data structure and algorithm raised their hand if they could efficiently make progress on any of the currently open subproblems By 1994 there were 20 such heuristic level HL modules 8 as of 2017 there are over 1050 HL modules 12 Some of these HL modules are very general such as a module that caches the Kleene Star transitive closure of all the commonlyused transitive relation s in Cycs ontology Some are domainspecific such as a chemical equationbalancer These can be and often are an escape to pointer to some externally available program or webservice or online database such as a module to quickly compute the current population of a city by knowing wherehow to look that up CycL has a publicly released specification and dozens of HL modules were described in Lenat and Guhas textbook 8 but the actual Cyc inference engine code and the full list of 1000 HL modules is Cycorpproprietary 3 The name Cyc from encyclopedia pronounced saɪk like syke is a registered trademark owned by Cycorp Access to Cyc is through paid licenses but bona fide AI research groups are given researchonly nocost licenses cf ResearchCyc as of 2017 over 600 such groups worldwide have these licenses Typical pieces of knowledge represented in the Cyc knowledge base are Every tree is a plant and Plants die eventually When asked whether trees die the inference engine can draw the obvious conclusion and answer the question correctly Most of Cycs knowledge outside math is only true by default For example Cyc knows that as a default parents love their children when youre made happy you smile taking your first step is a big accomplishment when someone you love has a big accomplishment that makes you happy and only adults have children When asked whether a picture captioned Someone watching his daughter take her first step contains a smiling adult person Cyc can logically infer that the answer is Yes and show its work by presenting the step by step logical argument using those five pieces of knowledge from its knowledge base These are formulated in the language CycL which is based on predicate calculus and has a syntax similar to that of the Lisp programming language In 2008 Cyc resources were mapped to many Wikipedia articles 13 Cyc is presently connected to Wikidata Future plans may connect Cyc to both DBpedia and Freebase Much of the current work Cyc continues to be knowledge engineering representing facts about the world by hand and implementing efficient inference mechanisms on that knowledge Increasingly however work at Cycorp involves giving the Cyc system the ability to communicate with end users in natural language and to assist with the ongoing knowledge formation process via machine learning and natural language understanding Another large effort at Cycorp is building a suite of Cycpowered ontological engineering tools to lower the bar to entry for individuals to contribute to edit browse and query Cyc Like many companies Cycorp has ambitions to use Cycs natural language processing to parse the entire internet to extract structured data unlike all others it is able to call on the Cyc system itself to act as an inductive bias and as an adjudicator of ambiguity metaphor and ellipsis Knowledge base edit The concept names in Cyc are CycL terms or constants 6 Constants start with an optional and are casesensitive There are constants for Individual items known as individuals such as BillClinton or France Collections such as TreeThePlant containing all trees or EquivalenceRelation containing all equivalence relations A member of a collection is called an instance of that collection 8 Functions which produce new terms from given ones For example FruitFn when provided with an argument describing a type or collection of plants will return the collection of its fruits By convention function constants start with an uppercase letter and end with the string Fn Truth functions which can apply to one or more other concepts and return either true or false For example siblings is the sibling relationship true if the two arguments are siblings By convention truth function constants start with a lowercase letter Truth functions may be broken down into logical connectives such as and or not implies quantifiers forAll thereExists etc and predicates Two important binary predicates are isa and genls The first one describes that one item is an instance of some collection the second one that one collection is a subcollection of another one Facts about concepts are asserted using certain CycL sentences Predicates are written before their arguments in parentheses isa BillClinton UnitedStatesPresident Bill Clinton belongs to the collection of US presidents genls TreeThePlant Plant All trees are plants capitalCity France Paris Paris is the capital of France Sentences can also contain variables strings starting with These sentences are called rules One important rule asserted about the isa predicate reads implies and isa OBJ SUBSET genls SUBSET SUPERSET isa OBJ SUPERSET If OBJ is an instance of the collection SUBSET and SUBSET is a subcollection of SUPERSET then OBJ is an instance of the collection SUPERSET Another typical example is relationAllExists biologicalMother ChordataPhylum FemaleAnimal which means that for every instance of the collection ChordataPhylum ie for every chordate there exists a female animal instance of FemaleAnimal which is its mother described by the predicate biologicalMother 8 The knowledge base is divided into microtheories Mt collections of concepts and facts typically pertaining to one particular realm of knowledge Unlike the knowledge base as a whole each microtheory must be free from monotonic contradictions Each microtheory is a firstclass object in the Cyc ontology it has a name that is a regular constant microtheory constants contain the string Mt by convention An example is MathMt the microtheory containing mathematical knowledge The microtheories can inherit from each other and are organized in a hierarchyone specialization of MathMt is GeometryGMt the microtheory about geometry Inference engine edit An inference engine is a computer program that tries to derive answers from a knowledge baseThe Cyc inference engine performs general logical deduction including modus ponens modus tollens universal quantification and existential quantification 14 It also performs inductive reasoning statistical machine learning and symbolic machine learning and abductive reasoning but of course sparingly and using the existing knowledge base as a filter and guide Releases edit OpenCyc edit The first version of OpenCyc was released in spring 2002 and contained only 6000 concepts and 60000 facts The knowledge base was released under the Apache License Cycorp stated its intention to release OpenCyc under parallel unrestricted licences to meet the needs of its users The CycL and SubL interpreter the program that allows users to browse and edit the database as well as to draw inferences was released free of charge but only as a binary without source code It was made available for Linux and Microsoft Windows The open source Texai 15 project released the RDF compatible content extracted from OpenCyc 16 A version of OpenCyc 40 was released in June 2012 OpenCyc 40 included much of the Cyc ontology at that time containing hundreds of thousands of terms along with millions of assertions relating the terms to each other however these are mainly taxonomic assertions not the complex rules available in Cyc The OpenCyc 40 knowledge base contained 239000 concepts and 2093000 facts The main point of releasing OpenCyc was to help AI researchers understand what was missing from what they now call ontologies and knowledge graph s Its useful and important to have properly taxonomized concepts like person night sleep lying down waking happy etc but whats missing from the OpenCyc content about those terms but present in the Cyc KB content are the various rules of thumb that most of us share about those terms that as a default in the ModernWesternHumanCultureMt each person sleeps at night sleeps lying down can be woken up is not happy about being woken up and so on That point does not require continuallyupdated releases of OpenCyc so as of 2017 OpenCyc is no longer available ResearchCyc edit In July 2006 Cycorp released the executable of ResearchCyc 10 a version of Cyc aimed at the research community at no charge ResearchCyc was in beta stage of development during all of 2004 a beta version was released in February 2005 In addition to the taxonomic information contained in OpenCyc ResearchCyc includes significantly more semantic knowledge ie additional facts and rules of thumb involving the concepts in its knowledge base it also includes a large lexicon English parsing and generation tools and Java based interfaces for knowledge editing and querying In addition it contains a system for Ontologybased data integration As of 2017 regular releases of ResearchCyc continued to appear with 600 research groups utilizing licenses around the world at no cost for noncommercial research purposes As of December 2019 ResearchCyc is no longer supported Cycorp expects to improve and overhaul tools for external developers over the coming years Applications edit There have been over 100 successful applications of Cyc 17 listed here are a few mutually dissimilar instances Pharmaceutical Term Thesaurus ManagerIntegrator edit For over a decade Glaxo has used Cyc to semiautomatically integrate all the large hundreds of thousands of terms thesauri of pharmaceuticalindustry terms that reflect differing usage across companies countries years and subindustries 18 This ontology integration task requires domain knowledge shallow semantic knowledge but also arbitrarily deep common sense knowledge and reasoning Pharma vocabulary varies across countries sub industries companies departments and decades of time Eg whats a gel pak Whats the street name for ranitidine hydrochloride Each of these n controlled vocabularies is an ontology with approximately 300k terms Glaxo researchers need to issue a query in their current vocabulary have it translated into a neutral true meaning and then have that transformed in the opposite direction to find potential matches against documents each of which was written to comply with a particular known vocabulary They had been using a large staff to do that manually Cyc is used as the universal interlingua capable of representing the union of all the terms true meanings and capable of representing the 300k transformations between each of those controlled vocabularies and Cyc thereby converting an n2 problem into a linear one without introducing the usual sort of telephone game attenuation of meaning Furthermore creating each of those 300k mappings for each thesaurus is done in a largely automated fashion by Cyc Terrorism Knowledge Base edit The comprehensive Terrorism Knowledge Base is an application of Cyc in development that will try to ultimately contain all relevant knowledge about terrorist groups their members leaders ideology founders sponsors affiliations facilities locations finances capabilities intentions behaviors tactics and full descriptions of specific terrorist events The knowledge is stored as statements in mathematical logic suitable for computer understanding and reasoning 19 Cleveland Clinic Foundation edit The Cleveland Clinic has used Cyc to develop a natural language query interface of biomedical information spanning decades of information on cardiothoracic surgeries 20 A query is parsed into a set of CycL higherorder logic fragments with open variables eg this question is talking about a person who developed an endocarditis infection this question is talking about a subset of Cleveland Clinic patients who underwent surgery there in 2009 etc then various constraints are applied medical domain knowledge common sense discourse pragmatics syntax to see how those fragments could possibly fit together into one semantically meaningful formal query significantly in most cases there is exactly one and only one such way of incorporating and integrating those fragments 21 Integrating the fragments involves i deciding which open variables in which fragments actually represent the same variable and ii for all the final variables decide what order and scope of quantification that variable should have and what type universal or existential That logical CycL query is then converted into a SPARQL query that is passed to the CCF SemanticDB that is its data lake MathCraft edit One Cyc application aims to help students doing math at a 6th grade level helping them much more deeply understand that subject matter 22 It is based on the experience that we often have thought we understood something but only really understood it after we had to explain or teach it to someone else Unlike almost all other educational software where the computer plays the role of the teacher this application of Cyc called MathCraft 23 has Cyc play the role of a fellow student who is always slightly more confused than you the user are about the subject The users role is to observe the Cyc avatar and give it advice correct its errors mentor it get it to see what its doing wrong etc As the user gives good advice Cyc allows the avatar to make fewer mistakes of that type hence from the users point of view it seems as though the user has just successfully taught it something This is a variation of Learning by Teaching Criticisms edit The Cyc project has been described as one of the most controversial endeavors of the artificial intelligence history 24 Catherine Havasi CEO of Luminoso says that Cyc is the predecessor project to IBMs Watson 25 Machinelearning scientist Pedro Domingos refers to the project as a catastrophic failure for several reasons including the unending amount of data required to produce any viable results and the inability for Cyc to evolve on its own 26 Robin Hanson a professor of economics at George Mason University gives a more balanced analysis mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 Of course the CYC project is open to criticism on its many particular choices People have complained about its logiclike and languagelike representations about its selection of prototypical cases to build from eg encyclopedia articles about its focus on answering over acting about how often it rebuilds vs maintaining legacy systems and about being private vs publishing everything But any large project like this would produce such disputes and it is not obvious any of its choices have been seriously wrong They had to start somewhere and in my opinion they have now collected a knowledge base with a truly spectacular size scope and integration Other architectures may well work better but if knowing lots is anywhere near as important as Lenat thinks Id expect serious AI attempts to import CYCs knowledge translating it into a new representation No other source has anywhere near CYCs size scope and integration 27 A similar sentiment was expressed by Marvin Minsky Unfortunately the strategies most popular among AI researchers in the 1980s have come to a dead end said Minsky Socalled expert systems which emulated human expertise within tightly defined subject areas like law and medicine could match users queries to relevant diagnoses papers and abstracts yet they could not learn concepts that most children know by the time they are 3 years old For each different kind of problem said Minsky the construction of expert systems had to start all over again because they didnt accumulate commonsense knowledge Only one researcher has committed himself to the colossal task of building a comprehensive commonsense reasoning system according to Minsky Douglas Lenat through his Cyc project has directed the linebyline entry of more than 1 million rules into a commonsense knowledge base 28 Gary Marcus a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University and the cofounder of an AI company called Geometric Intelligence says it represents an approach that is very different from all the deeplearning stuff that has been in the news 29 This is consistent with Doug Lenats position that Sometimes the veneer of intelligence is not enough 30 Stephen Wolfram writes In the early days of the field of artificial intelligence there were plenty of discussions of knowledge representation with approaches based variously on the grammar of natural language the structure of predicate logic or the formalism of databases Very few largescale projects were attempted Doug Lenats Cyc being a notable counterexample 31 Every few years since it began publishing 1993 there is a new Wired Magazine article about Cyc 32 28 33 some positive and some negative including one issue 34 which contained one of each Notable employees edit This is a list of some of the notable people who work or have worked on Cyc either while it was a project at MCC where Cyc was
