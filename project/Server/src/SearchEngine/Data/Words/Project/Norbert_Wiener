Wiener was born in Columbia Missouri the first child of Leo Wiener and Bertha Kahn Jews 4 from Poland and Germany respectively Through his father he was related to Maimonides the famous rabbi philosopher and physician from Al Andalus as well as to Akiva Eger chief rabbi of Posen from 1815 to 1837 5 Leo had educated Norbert at home until 1903 employing teaching methods of his own invention except for a brief interlude when Norbert was 7 years of age Earning his living teaching German and Slavic languages Leo read widely and accumulated a personal library from which the young Norbert benefited greatly Leo also had ample ability in mathematics and tutored his son in the subject until he left home In his autobiography Norbert described his father as calm and patient unless he Norbert failed to give a correct answer at which his father would lose his temper He became an agnostic 6 After graduating from Ayer High School in 1906 at 11 years of age Wiener entered Tufts College He was awarded a BA in mathematics in 1909 at the age of 14 whereupon he began graduate studies of zoology at Harvard In 1910 he transferred to Cornell to study philosophy He graduated in 1911 at 17 years of age Harvard and World War I edit The next year he returned to Harvard while still continuing his philosophical studies Back at Harvard Wiener became influenced by Edward Vermilye Huntington whose mathematical interests ranged from axiomatic foundations to engineering problems Harvard awarded Wiener a PhD in June 1913 when he was 18 years old for a dissertation on mathematical logic a comparison of the work of Ernst Schröder with that of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell supervised by Karl Schmidt the essential results of which were published as Wiener 1914 In that dissertation he was the first to state publicly that ordered pairs can be defined in terms of elementary set theory Hence relations can be defined by set theory thus the theory of relations does not require any axioms or primitive notions distinct from those of set theory In 1921 Kazimierz Kuratowski proposed a simplification of Wieners definition of ordered pairs and that simplification has been in common use ever since It is x y x x y In 1914 Wiener traveled to Europe to be taught by Bertrand Russell and G H Hardy at Cambridge University and by David Hilbert and Edmund Landau at the University of Göttingen During 191516 he taught philosophy at Harvard then was an engineer for General Electric and wrote for the Encyclopedia Americana Wiener was briefly a journalist for the Boston Herald where he wrote a feature story on the poor labor conditions for mill workers in Lawrence Massachusetts but he was fired soon afterwards for his reluctance to write favorable articles about a politician the newspapers owners sought to promote 7 Although Wiener eventually became a staunch pacifist he eagerly contributed to the war effort in World War I In 1916 with Americas entry into the war drawing closer Wiener attended a training camp for potential military officers but failed to earn a commission One year later Wiener again tried to join the military but the government again rejected him due to his poor eyesight In the summer of 1918 Oswald Veblen invited Wiener to work on ballistics at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland 8 Living and working with other mathematicians strengthened his interest in mathematics However Wiener was still eager to serve in uniform and decided to make one more attempt to enlist this time as a common soldier Wiener wrote in a letter to his parents I should consider myself a pretty cheap kind of a swine if I were willing to be an officer but unwilling to be a soldier 9 This time the army accepted Wiener into its ranks and assigned him by coincidence to a unit stationed at Aberdeen Maryland World War I ended just days after Wieners return to Aberdeen and Wiener was discharged from the military in February 1919 10 After the war edit Norbert Wiener was regarded as a semilegendary figure at MIT Norbert standing and Margaret sitting Wiener at the International Congress of Mathematicians Zurich 1932 Wiener was unable to secure a permanent position at Harvard a situation he blamed largely on antisemitism at the university and in particular on the antipathy of Harvard mathematician G D Birkhoff 11 He was also rejected for a position at the University of Melbourne At W F Osgoods suggestion Wiener became an instructor of mathematics at MIT where he spent the remainder of his career becoming promoted eventually to professor For many years a photograph of him was prominently displayed in the Infinite Corridor often used in giving directions but as of 2017 update it has been removed 12 In 1926 Wiener returned to Europe as a Guggenheim scholar He spent most of his time at Göttingen and with Hardy at Cambridge working on Brownian motion the Fourier integral Dirichlets problem harmonic analysis and the Tauberian theorems In 1926 Wieners parents arranged his marriage to a German immigrant Margaret Engemann they had two daughters His sister Constance married Philip Franklin Their daughter Janet Wieners niece married Václav E Beneš 13 Many tales perhaps apocryphal were told of him at MIT especially concerning his absentmindedness It was said that he returned home once to find his house empty He inquired of a neighborhood girl the reason and she said that the family had moved elsewhere that day He thanked her for the information and she replied Thats why I stayed behind Daddy 14 In the runup to World War II 193945 Wiener became a member of the China Aid Society and the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars 15 He was interested in placing scholars such as YukWing Lee and Antoni Zygmund who had lost their positions 16 During and after World War II edit During World War II his work on the automatic aiming and firing of antiaircraft guns caused Wiener to investigate information theory independently of Claude Shannon and to invent the Wiener filter To him is due the now standard practice of modeling an information source as a random processin other words as a variety of noise His antiaircraft work eventually led him to formulate cybernetics 17 After the war his fame helped MIT to recruit a research team in cognitive science composed of researchers in neuropsychology and the mathematics and biophysics of the nervous system including Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts These men later made pioneering contributions to computer science and artificial intelligence Soon after the group was formed Wiener suddenly ended all contact with its members mystifying his colleagues This emotionally traumatized Pitts and led to his career decline In their biography of Wiener Conway and Siegelman suggest that Wieners wife Margaret who detested McCullochs bohemian lifestyle engineered the breach 18 Wiener later helped develop the theories of cybernetics robotics computer control and automation He discussed the modeling of neurons with John von Neumann and in a letter from November 1946 von Neumann presented his thoughts in advance of a meeting with Wiener 19 Wiener always shared his theories and findings with other researchers and credited the contributions of others These included Soviet researchers and their findings Wieners acquaintance with them caused him to be regarded with suspicion during the Cold War He was a strong advocate of automation to improve the standard of living and to end economic underdevelopment His ideas became influential in India whose government he advised during the 1950s After the war Wiener became increasingly concerned with what he believed was political interference with scientific research and the militarization of science His article A Scientist Rebels from the January 1947 issue of The Atlantic Monthly 20 urged scientists to consider the ethical implications of their work After the war he refused to accept any government funding or to work on military projects The way Wieners beliefs concerning nuclear weapons and the Cold War contrasted with those of von Neumann is the major theme of the book John Von Neumann and Norbert Wiener 21 full citation needed Wiener was a participant of the Macy conferences He died in March 1964 aged 69 in Stockholm from a heart attack Wiener and his wife are buried at the Vittum Hill Cemetery in Sandwich New Hampshire Awards and honors edit Wiener was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1936 at Oslo and in 1950 at Cambridge Massachusetts Wiener won the Bôcher Memorial Prize in 1933 and the National Medal of Science in 1963 presented by President Johnson at a White House Ceremony in January 1964 shortly before Wieners death Wiener won the 1965 US National Book Award in Science Philosophy and Religion for God Golem Inc A Comment on Certain Points where Cybernetics Impinges on Religion 22 The Norbert Wiener Prize in Applied Mathematics was endowed in 1967 in honor of Norbert Wiener by MITs mathematics department and is provided jointly by the American Mathematical Society and Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics The Norbert Wiener Award for Social and Professional Responsibility awarded annually by CPSR was established in 1987 in honor of Wiener to recognize contributions by computer professionals to socially responsible use of computers The crater Wiener on the far side of the Moon is named after him The Norbert Wiener Center for Harmonic Analysis and Applications at the University of Maryland College Park is named

Norbert Wiener Cybernetics Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine Wiener was an early studier of stochastic and mathematical noise processes contributing work relevant to electronic engineering electronic communication and control systems It was Wieners idea to model a signal as if it were an exotic type of noise giving it a sound mathematical basis The example often given to students is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces where each letter of the alphabet and the space has an assigned probability But Wiener dealt with analog signals where such a simple example doesnt exist Wieners early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory 25 Wiener originated cybernetics a formalization of the notion of feedback with many implications for engineering systems control computer science biology philosophy and the organization of society Wieners work with cybernetics influenced Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead and through them anthropology sociology and education 26 In the mathematical field of probability the Wiener sausage is a neighborhood of the trace of a Brownian motion up to a time t given by taking all points within a fixed distance of Brownian motion It can be visualized as a cylinder of fixed radius the centerline of which is Brownian motion Wiener equation edit A simple mathematical representation of Brownian motion the Wiener equation named after Wiener assumes the current velocity of a fluid particle fluctuates randomly Wiener filter edit For signal processing the Wiener filter is a filter proposed by Wiener during the 1940s and published in 1942 as a classified document Its purpose is to reduce the amount of noise present in a signal by comparison with an estimate of the desired noiseless signal Wiener developed the filter at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT to predict the position of German bombers from radar reflections It is necessary to predict the future because by the time the shell reaches the vicinity of the target the target has moved and may have changed direction slightly They even modeled the muscle response of the pilot which led eventually to cybernetics The unmanned V1s were particularly easy to model and on a good day American guns fitted with Wiener filters would shoot down 99 out of 100 V1s as they entered Britain from the English channel on their way to London What emerged was a mathematical theory of great generalitya theory for predicting the future as best one can on the basis of incomplete information about the past It was a statistical theory that included applications that did not strictly speaking predict the future but only tried to remove noise It made use of Wieners earlier work on integral equations and Fourier transforms 27 28 In mathematics edit Wiener took a great interest in the mathematical theory of Brownian motion named after Robert Brown proving many results now widely known such as the nondifferentiability of the paths Consequently the onedimensional version of Brownian motion was named the Wiener process It is the best known of the Lévy processes càdlàg stochastic processes with stationary statistically independent increments and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics physics and economics eg on the stockmarket Wieners Tauberian theorem a 1932 result of Wiener developed Tauberian theorems in summability theory on the face of it a chapter of real analysis by showing that most of the known results could be encapsulated in a principle taken from harmonic analysis In its present formulation the theorem of Wiener does not have any obvious association with Tauberian theorems which deal with infinite series the translation from results formulated for integrals or using the language of functional analysis and Banach algebras is however a relatively routine process The PaleyWiener theorem relates growth properties of entire functions on C n and Fourier transformation of Schwartz distributions of compact support The WienerKhinchin theorem also known as the Wiener Khintchine theorem and the Khinchin Kolmogorov theorem states that the power spectral density of a widesensestationary random process is the Fourier transform of the corresponding autocorrelation function An abstract Wiener space is a mathematical object in measure theory used to construct a decent strictly positive and locally finite measure on an infinitedimensional vector space Wieners original construction only applied to the space of realvalued continuous paths on the unit interval known as classical Wiener space Leonard Gross provided the generalization to the case of a general separable Banach space The notion of a Banach space itself was discovered independently by both Wiener and Stefan Banach at around the same time 29 The Norbert Wiener Center for Harmonic Analysis and Applications NWC in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Maryland College Park is devoted to the scientific and mathematical legacy of Norbert Wiener The NWC website highlights the research activities of the Center Further each year the Norbert Wiener Center hosts the February Fourier Talks a twoday national conference displaying advances in pure and applied harmonic analysis in industry government and academia In popular culture edit His work with Mary Brazier is referenced in Avis DeVoto s As Always Julia 30 A character named after him appears briefly in the Hugo Award
