Control system For other uses see Control system disambiguation The centrifugal governor is an early proportional control mechanism A control system manages commands directs or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems using control loops It can range from a single home heating controller using a thermostat controlling a domestic boiler to large Industrial control systems which are used for controlling processes or machines For continuously modulated control a feedback controller is used to automatically control a process or operation The control system compares the value or status of the process variable PV being controlled with the desired value or setpoint SP and applies the difference as a control signal to bring the process variable output of the plant to the same value as the setpoint For sequential and combinational logic software logic such as in a programmable logic controller is used Contents 1 Openloop and closedloop control 2 Feedback control systems 3 Logic

Physical implementation 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Openloop and closedloop control edit There are two common classes of control action open loop and closed loop In an openloop control system the control action from the controller is independent of the process variable An example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer The control action is the switching on or off of the boiler The process variable is the building temperature This controller operates the heating system for a constant time regardless of the temperature of the building In a closedloop control system the control action from the controller is dependent on the desired and actual process variable In the case of the boiler analogy this would utilise a thermostat to monitor the building temperature and feed back a signal to ensure the controller output maintains the building temperature close to that set on the thermostat A closed loop controller has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to control a process variable at the same value as the setpoint For this reason closedloop controllers are also called feedback controllers 1 Feedback control systems edit Example of a single industrial control loop showing continuously modulated control of process flow A basic feedback loop In the case of linear feedback systems a control loop including sensors control algorithms and actuators is arranged in an attempt to regulate a variable at a setpoint SP An everyday example is the cruise control on a road vehicle where external influences such as hills would cause speed changes and the driver has the ability to alter the desired set speed The PID algorithm in the controller restores the actual speed to the desired speed in the optimum way with minimal delay or overshoot by controlling the power output of the vehicles engine Control systems that include some sensing of the results they are trying to achieve are making use of feedback and can adapt to varying circumstances to some extent Openloop control systems do not make use of feedback and run only in prearranged ways Logic control edit Logic control systems for industrial and commercial machinery were historically implemented by interconnected electrical relays and cam timers using ladder logic Today most such systems are constructed with microcontrollers or more specialized programmable logic controllers PLCs The notation of ladder logic is still in use as a programming method for PLCs 2 Logic controllers may respond to switches and sensors and can cause the machinery to start and stop various operations through the use of actuators Logic controllers are used to sequence mechanical operations in many applications Examples include elevators washing machines and other systems with interrelated operations An automatic sequential control system may trigger a series of mechanical actuators in the correct sequence to perform a task For example various electric and pneumatic transducers may fold and glue a cardboard box fill it with product and then seal it in an automatic packaging machine PLC software can be written in many different ways ladder diagrams SFC sequential function charts or statement lists 3 Onoff control edit Main article Bangbang control Onoff control uses a feedback controller that switches abruptly between two states A simple bimetallic domestic thermostat can be described as an onoff controller When the temperature in the room PV goes below the user setting SP the heater is switched on Another example is a pressure switch on an air compressor When the pressure PV drops below the setpoint SP the compressor is powered Refrigerators and vacuum pumps contain similar mechanisms Simple onoff control systems like these can be cheap and effective Linear control edit Linear control systems use negative feedback to produce a control signal to maintain the controlled PV at the desired SP There are several types of linear control systems with different capabilities Proportional control edit Main article Proportional control Step responses for a second order system defined by the transfer function H s ω n 2 s 2 2 ζ ω n s ω n 2 displaystyle Hsfrac omega n2s22zeta omega nsomega n2 where ζ displaystyle zeta is the damping ratio and ω n displaystyle omega n is the undamped natural frequency Proportional control is a type of linear feedback control system in which a correction is applied to the controlled variable which is proportional to the difference between the desired value SP and the measured value PV Two classic mechanical examples are the toilet bowl float proportioning valve and the flyball governor The proportional control system is more complex than an onoff control system but simpler than a proportionalintegralderivative PID control system used for instance in an automobile cruise control Onoff control will work for systems that do not require high accuracy or responsiveness but is not effective for rapid and timely corrections and responses Proportional control overcomes this by modulating the manipulated variable MV such as a control valve at a gain level which avoids instability but applies correction as fast as practicable by applying the optimum quantity of proportional correction A drawback of proportional control is that it cannot eliminate the residual SPPV error as it requires an error to generate a proportional output A PI controller can be used to overcome this The PI controller uses a proportional term P to remove the gross error and an integral term I to eliminate the residual offset error by integrating the error over time In some systems there are practical limits to the range of the MV For example a heater has a limit to how much heat it can produce and a valve can open only so far Adjustments to the gain simultaneously alter the range of error values over which the MV is between these limits The width of this range in units of the error variable and therefore of the PV is called the proportional band PB Furnace example edit When controlling the temperature of an industrial furnace it is usually better to control the opening of the fuel valve in proportion to the current needs of the furnace This helps avoid thermal shocks and applies heat more effectively At low gains only a small corrective action is applied when errors are detected The system may be safe and stable but may be sluggish in response to changing conditions Errors will remain uncorrected for relatively long periods of time and the system is overdamped If the proportional gain is increased such systems become more responsive and errors are dealt with more quickly There is an optimal value for the gain setting when the overall system is said to be critically damped Increases in loop gain beyond this point lead to oscillations in the PV and such a system is underdamped Adjusting gain to achieve critically damped behavior is known as tuning the control system In the underdamped case the furnace heats quickly Once the setpoint is reached stored heat within the heater subsystem and in the walls of the furnace will keep the measured temperature rising beyond what is required After rising above the setpoint the temperature falls back and eventually heat is applied again Any delay in reheating the heater subsystem allows the furnace temperature to fall further below setpoint and the cycle repeats The temperature oscillations that an underdamped furnace control system produces are undesirable In a critically damped system as the temperature approaches the setpoint the heat input begins to be reduced the rate of heating of the furnace has time to slow and the system avoids overshoot Overshoot is also avoided in an underdamped system but an underdamped system is unnecessarily slow to initially reach setpoint respond to external changes to the system eg opening the furnace door PID control edit A block diagram of a PID controller Effects of varying PID parameters K p K i K d on the step response of a system Main article PID controller Apart from sluggish performance to avoid oscillations another problem with proportionalonly control is that power application is always in direct proportion to the error In the example above we assumed that the set temperature could be maintained with 50 power What happens if the furnace is required in a different application where a higher set temperature will require 80 power to maintain it If the gain was finally set to a 50 PB then 80 power will not be applied unless the furnace is 15 below setpoint so for this other application the operators will have to remember always to set the setpoint temperature 15 higher than actually needed This 15 figure is not completely constant either it will depend on the surrounding ambient temperature as well as other factors that affect heat loss from or absorption within the furnace To resolve these two problems many feedback control schemes include mathematical extensions to improve performance The most common extensions lead to proportionalintegralderivative control or PID control Derivative action edit The derivative part is concerned with the rateofchange of the error with time If the measured variable approaches the setpoint rapidly then the actuator is backed off early to allow it to coast to the required level conversely if the measured value begins to move rapidly away from the setpoint extra effort is appliedin proportion to that rapidityto try to maintain it Derivative action makes a control system behave much more intelligently On control systems like the tuning of the temperature of a furnace or perhaps the motioncontrol of a heavy item like a gun or camera on a moving vehicle the derivative action of a welltuned PID controller can allow it to reach and maintain a setpoint better than most skilled human operators could If derivative action is overapplied it can lead to oscillations too An example would be a PV that increased rapidly towards SP then halted early and seemed to shy away from the setpoint before rising towards it again Integral action edit Change of response of second order system to a step input for varying Ki values The integral term magnifies the effect of longterm steadystate errors applying everincreasing effort until they reduce to zero In the example of the furnace above working at various temperatures if the heat being applied does not bring the furnace up to setpoint for whatever reason integral action increasingly moves the proportional band relative to the setpoint until the PV error is reduced to zero and the setpoint is achieved Ramp up per minute edit Some controllers include the option to limit the ramp up per minute This option can be very helpful in stabilizing small boilers 3 MBTUH especially during the summer during light loadsA utility boiler unit may be required to change load at a rate of as much as 5 per minute IEA Coal Online 2 2007 4 Other techniques edit It is possible to filter the PV or error signal Doing so can reduce the response of the system to undesirable frequencies to help reduce instability or oscillations Some feedback systems will oscillate at just one frequency By filtering out that frequency more stiff feedback can be applied making the system more responsive without shaking itself apart Feedback systems can be combined In cascade control one control loop applies control algorithms to a measured variable against a setpoint but then provides a varying setpoint to another control loop rather than affecting process variables directly If a system has several different measured variables to be controlled separate control systems will be present for each of them Control engineering in many applications produces control systems that are more complex than PID control Examples of such fields include flybywire aircraft control systems chemical plants and oil refineries Model predictive control systems are designed using specialized computeraideddesign software and empirical mathematical models of the system to be controlled Hybrid systems of PID and logic control are widely used The output from a linear controller may be interlocked by logic for instance Fuzzy logic edit Main article Fuzzy logic Fuzzy logic is an attempt to apply the easy design of logic controllers to the control of complex continuously varying systems Basically a measurement in a fuzzy logic system can be partly true that is if yes is 1 and no is 0 a fuzzy measurement can be between 0 and 1 The rules of the system are written in natural language and translated into fuzzy logic For example the design for a furnace would start with If the temperature is too high reduce the fuel to the furnace If the temperature is too low increase the fuel to the furnace Measurements from the real world such as the temperature of a furnace are converted to values between 0 and 1 by seeing where they fall on a triangle Usually the tip of the triangle is the maximum possible value which translates to 1 Fuzzy logic then modifies Boolean logic to be arithmetical Usually the not operation is output 1 input the and operation is output input1 multiplied by input2 and or is output 1 1 input1 multiplied by 1 input2 This reduces to Boolean arithmetic if values are restricted to 0 and 1 instead of allowed to range in the unit interval 01 The last step is to defuzzify an output Basically the fuzzy calculations make a value between zero and one That number is used to select a value on a line whose slope and height converts the fuzzy value to a realworld output number The number then controls real machinery If the triangles are defined correctly and rules are right the result can be a good control system When a robust fuzzy design is reduced into a single quick calculation it begins to resemble a conventional feedback loop solution and it might appear that the fuzzy design was unnecessary However the fuzzy logic paradigm may provide scalability for large control systems where conventional methods become unwieldy or costly to derive Fuzzy electronics is an electronic technology that uses fuzzy logic instead of the twovalue logic more commonly used in digital electronics Physical implementation edit A DCS control room where plant information and controls
