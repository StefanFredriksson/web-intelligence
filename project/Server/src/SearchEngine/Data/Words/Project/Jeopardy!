Merchandise 113 Internet 12 References 121 Bibliography 13 External links Gameplay edit Three contestants each take their place behind a lectern with the returning champion occupying the leftmost lectern from the viewers perspective The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds Jeopardy Double Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy 3 The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics including history and current events the sciences the arts popular culture literature and languages 4 Category titles often feature puns wordplay or shared themes and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round All clues in the show are presented as answers and responses must be phrased in the form of a question 3 For example if a contestant were to select Presidents for 200 the resulting clue could be This Father of Our Country didnt really chop down a cherry tree to which the correct response would be Who iswas George Washington Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question the traditional phrasing of who isare for people or what isare for things or words is almost always used When the correct response is the name of a person the surname is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous First two rounds edit The layout of the Jeopardy game board since November 26 2001 showing the dollar values used in the first round Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode The Jeopardy and Double Jeopardy rounds each feature six categories each of which contains five clues which are ostensibly valued by difficulty 3 The dollar values of the clues increased over time On the original Jeopardy series clue values in the first round ranged from 10 to 50 5 On The AllNew Jeopardy they ranged from 25 to 125 In the two pilots that led to the current series the first kept the 25 to 125 values for the Jeopardy round while the second doubled these to 50250 The current series first round originally ranged from 100 to 500 doubled again from the second pilot 3 and was doubled to 200 to 1000 on November 26 2001 6 The Jeopardy round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host after which any contestant may ringin using a handheld signaling device The first contestant to ringin successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue If the contestant responds correctly the clues dollar value is added to the contestants score and they may select a new clue from the board An incorrect response or a failure to respond within five seconds deducts the clues value from the contestants score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response 3 Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly the host gives the correct response and the last correct questioner chooses the next clue 7 Contestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value as the shows writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order the Forrest Bounce a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents has been used successfully by Arthur Chu and the strategys namesake Chuck Forrest despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error 8 Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first if successful this has several advantages the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money James Holzhauer whose AprilJune 2019 winning streak included the ten highest singleday money totals in the shows history regularly used this strategy in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering 9 From the premiere of the original Jeopardy until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed Since September 1985 contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in To accommodate the rule change lights were added to the game board unseen by home viewers to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal 10 attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second 11 The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game In pre1985 episodes a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled according to Trebek the buzzer was eliminated because it was distracting to the viewers and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue 10 Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in Braille before each round begins and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud The second round Double Jeopardy features six new categories of clues Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy round 3 The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy round 7 if there is a tie the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern from the hosts perspective selects first A Daily Double is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy round and two in Double Jeopardy 3 The name and inspiration were taken from a horse racing term 12 Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as Audio Daily Doubles and Video Daily Doubles respectively Before the clue is revealed the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of hisher entire score known as a true Daily Double or the highest clue value available in the round whichever is greater 7 13 The contestant is given the exclusive right to answer the clue but must do so a correct response adds the value of the wager to the contestants score while an incorrect response deducts it Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager Whether or not the contestant responds correctly he or she chooses the next clue 7 Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind highervalued questions and almost never on the top row only eight of the over 11000 Daily Doubles since November 2001 007 have been in that location 14 During the Jeopardy round except in response to the Daily Double clue contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses In the Double Jeopardy round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy round the phrasing rule is followed more strictly with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not rephrased before the host or judges make a ruling 13 If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity typically after the Jeopardy Double Jeopardy rounds the first break or a Daily Double break If it occurs after taping of an episode is completed the affected contestants are invited back to compete on a future show complying with federal quiz show regulations 15 Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy with 0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the thirdplace prize On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy with 0 or less and as a result no Final Jeopardy round was played 16 This rule is still in place for the Trebek version although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer Harry Friedman may decide to display the clue for home viewers play if such a situation were ever to occur 17 During Celebrity Jeopardy games contestants with a 0 or negative score are given 1000 for the Final Jeopardy round Final Jeopardy edit The Final Jeopardy round features a single clue At the end of the Double Jeopardy round the host announces the Final Jeopardy category and a commercial break follows During the break barriers are placed between the contestant lecterns and each contestant makes a final wager they may wager any amount of their earnings but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate 69 666 and 1488 are among the forbidden wagers though 13 420 and 911 are allowed 18 Contestants write their wagers using a light pen on an electronic display on their lectern 19 After the break the Final Jeopardy clue is revealed and read by the host The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display while the shows iconic Think music plays in the background In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions contestants can use an index card and a marker to manually write their response and wager Visually impaired or blind contestants use a Braille keyboard to type in a wager and response In the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining that contestant automatically wins unless she wagers his or her entire score which has never been attempted in such a situation and loses Otherwise contestants responses are revealed in order of their preFinal Jeopardy scores from lowest to highest Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewers perspective As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so usually including some brief context otherwise the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect A correct response adds the amount of the contestants wager to hisher score while a miss failure to respond insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question even if correct deducts it 7 Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word 20 The contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that days winner If there is a tie for second place consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy round If all three contestants finish with 0 no one returns as champion for the next show and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy round the two contestants who were first and second will receive the secondplace prize and the contestant in third will receive the thirdplace prize The strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy has been studied If the leaders score is more than twice the second place contestants score the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager 21 269 Otherwise according to Jeopardy College Champion Keith Williams the leader will usually wager such that he or she will have a dollar more than twice the second place contestants score guaranteeing a win with a correct response 22 Writing about Jeopardy wagering in the 1990s Gilbert and Hatcher said that most players wager aggressively 21 269 Winnings edit The top scorer in each game is paid their winnings in cash and returns to play in the next match In the case of a tie all tying top scorers were paid their winnings 3 Nonwinners receive consolation prizes instead of their winnings in the game Since May 16 2002 consolation prizes have been 2000 for the secondplace contestants and 1000 for the thirdplace contestant 23 Since the show does not generally provide travel or lodging for contestants cash consolation prizes offset these costs The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles If a tournament travels does not stay in Los Angeles on the second week the show pays for travel 24 During Art Flemings hosting run all three contestants received their winnings in cash contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay and parting gifts usually an encyclopedia set This was changed at the start of Trebeks hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy rather than risk losing the money they had already won this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestants score would have to be paid instead of three 25 From 1984 to 2002 nonwinning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration Since 2004 a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants As of 2019 update GEICO serves as the presenting sponsor of the consolation prizes except for the Tournaments which are sponsored by Consumer Cellular 26 Returning champions edit The winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode Originally a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions the fiveday limit was eliminated at the beginning of season 20 on September 8 2003 27 Since November 2014 28 ties for first place following Final Jeopardy are broken with a tiebreaker clue resulting in only a single champion being named keeping their winnings and returning to compete in the next show The tied contestants are given the single clue and the first contestant to buzzin must give the correct question A contestant cannot win by default if the opponent gives an incorrect question that contestant must give a correct question to win the game If neither player gives the correct question another clue is given 29 Previously if two or all three contestants tied for first place they were declared cochampions and each retained his or her winnings and unless one was a fivetime champion who retired prior to 2003 returned on the following episode A tie occurred on the January 29 2014 episode when Arthur Chu leading at the end of Double Jeopardy wagered to tie challenger Carolyn Collins rather than winning Chu followed Jeopardy College Champion Keith Williamss advice to wager for the tie to increase the leaders chances of winning 30 31 A threeway tie for first place has only occurred once on the Trebek version on March 16 2007 when Scott Weiss Jamey Kirby and Anders Martinson all ended the game with 16000 32 Until March 1 2018 28 33 no regular game had ended in a tiebreaker however numerous tournament games have ended with a tiebreaker clue If no contestant finishes Final Jeopardy with a positive total there is no winner This has happened on several episodes 34 35 most recently on January 18 2016 36 Three new contestants appear on the next episode A triple zero has also occurred twice in tournament play 1991 Seniors and 2013 Teen and also once in a Celebrity Week episode in 1998 37 All consolation prize money regular play with two 2000 prizes and one 1000 prize and celebrity play prize money for charities are based on standard rules score after Double Jeopardy In tournament play an additional high scoring nonwinner will advance to the next round but all three players with a zero score in that game are eligible for that position should the score for that nonwinner be zero all tiebreaker rules apply A winner unable to return as champion because of a change in personal circumstances for example illness or a job offer may be allowed to appear as a cochampion in a later episode 38 39 40 Typically the two challengers participate in a backstage draw to determine lectern positions In all situations with three new contestants most notably unseeded tournaments in the first round the draw will also determine who will take the champions position and select first to start the game The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semifinal and finals Variations for tournament play edit Tournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants The first five episodes the quarterfinals feature three new contestants each day Other than in the Tournament of Champions the quarterfinals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions with the top five players occupying the champions lectern for the quarterfinal games The winners of the five quarterfinal games and the four highestscoring nonwinners wild cards advance to the semifinals which run for three days The semifinals are seeded with the quarterfinal winners being seeded 15 based on their quarterfinal scores and the wild cards being seeded 69 The winners of the quarterfinal games with the three highest scores occupy the champions lectern for the semifinals The winners of the three semifinal games advance to play in a twogame final match in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself 41 To prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win contestants are completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete 42 If there is a tie for the final wildcard position the nonwinner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second the tiebreaker is the contestants score after the Double Jeopardy round and if further tied the score after the Jeopardy round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card If two or more contestants tie for the highest score greater than zero at the end of the match first round semifinal game or end of a twogame final the standard tiebreaker is used However if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a twogame final no tiebreaker is played If none of the contestants in a quarterfinal or semifinal game end with a positive score no contestant automatically qualifies from that game and an additional wild card contestant advances instead 43 This occurred in the quarterfinals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semifinals of the 2013 Teen Tournament 43 In the finals contestants who finish Double Jeopardy with a 0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy that day their score for that leg is recorded as 0 Conception and development edit In a 1964 Associated Press profile released shortly before the original Jeopardy series premiered Merv Griffin offered the following account of how he created the quiz show mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to New York City from Duluth I was mulling over game show ideas when she noted that there had not been a successful question and answer game on the air since the quiz show scandals Why not do a switch and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question She fired a couple of answers to me 5280and the question of course was How many feet in a mile Another was 79 Wistful Vista that was Fibber and Mollie McGees address I loved the idea went straight to NBC with the idea and they bought it without even looking at a pilot show 44 45 Griffins first conception of the game used a board comprising ten categories with ten clues each but after finding that this board could not easily be shown on camera he reduced it to two rounds of thirty clues each with five clues in each of six categories 46 He originally intended the show to require grammatically correct phrasing eg only accepting Who is for a person but after finding that grammatical correction slowed the game down he decided that the show should instead accept any correct response that was in question form 47 Griffin discarded his initial title for the show Whats the Question when skeptical network executive Ed Vane rejected his original concept of the game claiming It doesnt have enough jeopardies 46 48 Jeopardy was not the first game show to give contestants the answers and require the questions That format had previously been used by the Gil Fates hosted program CBS Television Quiz which aired from July 1941 until May 1942 49 Personnel edit Hosts and announcers edit mwparseroutput

correspondents who appear in videos recorded around the world to narrate some clues 59 Explaining why the Clue Crew was added to the show executive producer Harry Friedman said TV is a visual medium

Alameda Avenue in Burbank California 82 The Trebek version was initially taped at Metromedia Stage 7 KTTV on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood 82 but moved its production facilities to Hollywood Center Studios Stage 9 in 1985 After the final shows of season 10 were recorded on February 15 1994 the Jeopardy production facilities were moved to Sony Pictures Studios Stage 10 on Washington Boulevard in Culver City California 82 where the show has been recorded ever since Five episodes are taped each day with two days of taping every other week 83 Set edit Various sets used by the syndicated version over the years From top to bottom 198485 198591 199196 19962002 200209 and 200913 Various technological and aesthetic changes have been made to the Jeopardy set over the years The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them 5 The AllNew Jeopardy s game board was exposed from behind doubleslide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount on one side and the clue on the other When the Trebek version premiered in 1984 the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991 84 In 2006 these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall 85 which was replaced in 2009 with 36 highdefinition flatpanel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics 86 From 1985 to 1997 the sets were designed to have a background color of blue for the Jeopardy round and red for the Double Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy rounds At the beginning of season 8 in 1991 a brand new set was introduced that resembled a grid 84 On the episode aired November 11 1996 two months after the start of season 13 Jeopardy introduced the first of several sets designed by Naomi Slodki who intended the set to resemble the foyer of a very contemporary library with wood and sandblasted glass and blue granite 87 Shortly after the start of season 19 in 2002 the show switched to yet another new set 88 which was given slight modifications when Jeopardy and sister show Wheel of Fortune transitioned to highdefinition broadcasting in 2006 85 During this time the show began to feature virtual tours of the set on its official web site 89 The various HD improvements for Jeopardy and Wheel represented a combined investment of approximately 4million 5000 hours of labor and 6 miles 97km of cable 85 Both shows had been shot using HD cameras for several years before beginning to broadcast in HD On standarddefinition television broadcasts the shows continue to be displayed with an aspect ratio of 43 In 2009 Jeopardy updated its set once again The new set debuted with special episodes taped at the 42nd annual International CES technology trade show hosted at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Winchester Las Vegas Valley Nevada and became the primary set for Jeopardy when the show began taping its 26th season which premiered on September 14 2009 86 It was significantly remodeled when season 30 premiered in September 2013 90 Theme music edit Since the debut of Jeopardy in 1964 several different songs and arrangements have served as the theme music for the show most of which were composed by Griffin The main theme for the original Jeopardy series was Take Ten 91 composed by Griffins wife Julann 92 The AllNew Jeopardy opened with January February March and closed with Frisco Disco both of which were composed by Griffin himself 93 The bestknown theme song on Jeopardy is Think originally composed by Griffin under the title A Time for Tony as a lullaby for his son 94 Think has always been used for the 30second period in Final Jeopardy when the contestants write down their responses and since the syndicated version debuted in 1984 a rendition of that tune has been used as the main theme song 95 Think has become so popular that it has been

surprise that what he considered to be a parlor game had transformed into such a national phenomenon under Trebek 134 In television interviews Fleming expressed similar sentiments while also noting
