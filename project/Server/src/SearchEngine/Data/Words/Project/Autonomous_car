reading History edit Main article History of selfdriving cars Experiments have been conducted on automated driving systems ADS since at least the 1920s 9 trials began in the 1950s The first semiautomated car was developed in 1977 by Japans Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour 19mph with the support of an elevated rail 10 11 The first truly autonomous cars appeared in the 1980s with Carnegie Mellon University s Navlab 12 and ALV 13 14 projects funded by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA starting in 1984 and MercedesBenz and Bundeswehr University Munich s EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987 15 By 1985 the ALV had demonstrated selfdriving speeds on twolane roads of 31 kilometres per hour 19mph with obstacle avoidance added in 1986 and offroad driving in day and nighttime conditions by 1987 16 A major milestone was achieved in 1995 with CMUs NavLab 5 completing the first autonomous coasttocoast drive of the United States Of the 2849mi 4585km between Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and San Diego California 2797mi 4501km were autonomous 982 completed with an average speed of 638mph 1027kmh 17 18 19 20 From the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005 automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA the US Army and the US Navy yielding incremental advances in speeds driving competence in more complex conditions controls and sensor systems 21 Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes 15 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 The US allocated US 650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale 30 Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4584 kilometres 2848mi across America in 1995 4501 kilometres 2797mi or 98 of it autonomously 31 Navlabs record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015 when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi augmented with Delphi technology over 5472 kilometres 3400mi through 15 states while remaining in selfdriving mode 99 of the time 32 In 2015 the US states of Nevada Florida California Virginia and Michigan together with Washington DC allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads 33 From 2016 to 2018 the European Commission funded the innovation strategy development for connected and automated driving through the Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT 34 Moreover the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda STRIA Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019 35 In 2017 Audi stated that its latest A8 would be automated at speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour 37mph using its Audi AI The driver would not have to do safety checks such as frequently gripping the steering wheel The Audi A8 was claimed to be the first production car to reach Level 3 automated driving and Audi would be the first manufacturer to use laser scanners in addition to cameras and ultrasonic sensors for their system 36 In November 2017 Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position 37 however there was still an employee in the car 38 In October 2018 Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10000000 miles 16000000km increasing by about 1000000 miles 1600000 kilometres per month 39 In December 2018 Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the US 40 ASTARs Institute for Infocomm Research I 2 R has developed a selfdriving vehicle which was the first to be approved in Singapore for public road testing at onenorth in July 2015 It has ferried several dignitaries such as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong Minister S Iswaran Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and several ministers from other countries 41 42 Definitions edit There is some inconsistency in the terminology used in the selfdriving car industry Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary Such confusion has been documented in SAE J3016 which states that Some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation Level 5 while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS automated driving system at or above Level 3 or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS Terminology and safety considerations edit Modern vehicles provide partly automated features such as keeping the car within its lane speed controls or emergency braking Nonetheless differences remain between a fully autonomous selfdriving car on one hand and driver assistance technologies on the other hand According to the BBC confusion between those concepts leads to deaths 43 The Association of British Insurers considers the usage of the word autonomous in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous because car ads make motorists think autonomous and autopilot means a vehicle can drive itself when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety Technology alone still is not able to drive the car When some car makers suggest or claim vehicles are selfdriving when they are only partly automated drivers risk becoming excessively confident leading to crashes while fully selfdriving cars are still a long way off in the UK 44 Autonomous vs automated edit Autonomous means selfgoverning 45 Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been automated made automatic subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment such as magnetic strips Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention 45 One approach is to implement communication networks both in the immediate vicinity for collision avoidance and farther away for congestion management Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicles autonomy while still not requiring human intervention Wood et al 2012 wrote This Article generally uses the term autonomous instead of the term automated The term autonomous was chosen because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use and thus is more familiar to the general public However the latter term is arguably more accurate Automated connotes control or operation by a machine while autonomous connotes acting alone or independently Most of the vehicle concepts that we are currently aware of have a person in the drivers seat utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them Thus the term automated would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts 46 As of 2017 most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regimeEuroNCAP defines autonomous in Autonomous Emergency Braking as the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident which implies the autonomous system is not the driver 47 Autonomous versus cooperative edit To enable a car to travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle some companies use a remote driver citation needed According to SAE J3016 mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 Some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and selfsufficiently but if they depend on communication andor cooperation with outside entities they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous Selfdriving car edit PC Magazine defines a selfdriving car as A computercontrolled car that drives itself 48 The Union of Concerned Scientists states that selfdriving cars are cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle Also known as autonomous or driverless cars they combine sensors and software to control navigate and drive the vehicle 49 Classification edit Tesla Autopilot system is classified as an SAE Level 2 system 50 A classification system based on six different levels ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems was published in 2014 by SAE International an automotive standardization body as J3016 Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to OnRoad Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems 51 52 This classification system is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required rather than the vehicle capabilities although these are very loosely related In the United States in 2013 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA released a formal classification system 53 but abandoned this system in favor of the SAE standard in 2016 Also in 2016 SAE updated its classification called J3016201609 54 Levels of driving automation edit In SAEs automation level definitions driving mode means a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements eg expressway merging high speed cruising low speed traffic jam closedcampus operations etc 1 55 Level 0 Automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control Level 1 hands on The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle Examples are systems where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls engine power to maintain a set speed Cruise Control or engine and brake power to maintain and vary speed Adaptive Cruise Control or ACC and Parking Assistance where steering is automated while speed is under manual control The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time Lane Keeping Assistance LKA Type II is a further example of Level 1 selfdriving The Automatic Emergency Braking alerts the driver to a crash and permits full braking capacity is also a Level 1 feature 56 Level 2 hands off The automated system takes full control of the vehicle accelerating braking and steering The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly The shorthand hands off is not meant to be taken literally In fact contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene Level 3 eyes off The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks eg the driver can text or watch a movie The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response like emergency braking The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time specified by the manufacturer when called upon by the vehicle to do so Level 4 mind off As level 3 but no driver attention is ever required for safety eg the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the drivers seat Selfdriving is supported only in limited spatial areas geofenced or under special circumstances Outside of these areas or circumstances the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip eg park the car if the driver does not retake control Level 5 steering wheel optional No human intervention is required at all An example would be a robotic taxi In the formal SAE definition below note in particular what happens in the shift from SAE 2 to SAE 3 the human driver no longer has to monitor the environment This is the final aspect of the dynamic driving task that is now passed over from the human to the automated system At SAE 3 the human driver still has the responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system At SAE 4 the human driver is relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention SAE J3016 Automation Levels 55 SAE Level Name Narrative definition Execution of steering and acceleration deceleration Monitoring of driving environment Fallback performance of dynamic driving task System capability driving modes Human driver monitors the driving environment 0 No Automation The fulltime performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task even when enhanced by warning or intervention systems Human driver Human driver Human driver na 1 Driver Assistance The driving modespecific execution by a driver assistance system of either steering or accelerationdeceleration using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver performs all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task Human driver and system Some driving modes 2 Partial Automation The driving modespecific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of both steering and accelerationdeceleration System Automated driving system monitors the driving environment 3 Conditional Automation The driving modespecific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene System System Human driver Some driving modes 4 High Automation even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene System Many driving modes 5 Full Automation under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver All driving modes Legal definition edit In Washington DC s district code Autonomous vehicle means a vehicle capable of navigating District roadways and interpreting trafficcontrol devices without a driver actively operating any of the vehicles control systems The term autonomous vehicle excludes a motor vehicle enabled with active safety systems or driver assistance systems including systems to provide electronic blindspot assistance crash avoidance emergency braking parking assistance adaptive cruise control lanekeep assistance lanedeparture warning or trafficjam and queuing assistance unless the system alone or in combination with other systems enables the vehicle on which the technology is installed to drive without active control or monitoring by a human operator In the same district code it is considered that An autonomous vehicle may operate on a public roadway provided that the vehicle 1 Has a manual override feature that allows a driver to assume control of the autonomous vehicle at any time 2 Has a driver seated in the control seat of the vehicle while in operation who is prepared to take control of the autonomous vehicle at any moment and 3 Is capable of operating in compliance with the Districts applicable traffic laws and motor vehicle laws and traffic control devices Semiautomated vehicles edit This section does not cite any sources Please help improve this

remove this template message Between manually driven vehicles SAE Level 0 and fully autonomous vehicles SAE Level 5 there are a variety of vehicle types that can be described to have some degree of automation These are collectively known as semiautomated vehicles As it could be a while before the technology and infrastructure are developed for full automation it is likely that vehicles will have increasing levels of automation These semiautomated vehicles could potentially harness many of the advantages of fully automated vehicles while still keeping the driver in charge of the vehicle Technical challenges edit Main article Hybrid navigation There are different systems that help the selfdriving car control the car Systems that need improvement include the car navigation system the location system the electronic map the map matching the global path planning the environment perception the laser perception the radar perception the visual perception the vehicle control the perception of vehicle speed and direction and the vehicle control method 57 The challenge for driverless car designers is to produce control systems capable of analyzing sensory data in order to provide accurate detection of other vehicles and the road ahead 58 Modern selfdriving cars generally use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping SLAM algorithms 59 which fuse data from multiple sensors and an offline map into current location estimates and map updates Waymo has developed a variant of SLAM with detection and tracking of other moving objects DATMO which also handles obstacles such as cars and pedestrians Simpler systems may use roadside realtime locating system RTLS technologies to aid localization Typical sensors include lidar stereo vision GPS and IMU 60 61 Control systems on automated cars may use Sensor Fusion which is an approach that integrates information from a variety of sensors on the car to produce a more consistent accurate and useful view of the environment 62 Heavy rainfall hail or snow could impede the car sensors citation needed Driverless vehicles require some form of machine vision for the purpose of visual object recognition Automated cars are being developed with deep neural networks 60 a type of deep learning architecture with many computational stages or levels in which neurons are simulated from the environment that activate the network 63 The neural network depends on an extensive amount of data extracted from reallife driving scenarios 60 enabling the neural network to learn how to execute the best course of action 63 In May 2018 researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced that they had built an automated car that can navigate unmapped roads 64 Researchers at their Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory CSAIL have developed a new system called MapLite which allows selfdriving cars to drive on roads that they have never been on before without using 3D maps The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle a sparse topological map such as OpenStreetMap ie having 2D features of the roads only and a series of sensors that observe the road conditions 65 Nature of the digital technology edit This section is written like a personal reflection personal essay or argumentative essay that states a Wikipedia editors personal feelings or presents an original argument about a topic Please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style November 2019 Learn how and when to remove this template message Autonomous vehicles as digital technology have certain characteristics that distinguish them from other types of technologies and vehicles Due to these characteristics autonomous vehicles are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes The characteristics will be explained based on the following subjects homogenization and decoupling connectivity reprogrammable and smart digital traces and modularity Homogenization and decoupling edit Homogenization comes from the fact that all digital information assumes the same form During the ongoing evolution of the digital era certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format This concept of homogenization also applies to autonomous vehicles In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information eg radar GPS motion sensors and computer vision Due to homogenization the digital information from these different techniques is stored in a homogeneous way This implies that all digital information comes in the same form which means their differences are decoupled and digital information can be transmitted stored and computed in a way that the vehicles and its operating system can better understand and act upon it Homogenization also helps to exponentially increase the computing power of hard and software Moores law which also supports the autonomous vehicles to understand and act upon the digital information in a more costeffective way therefore lowering the marginal costs Connectivity edit Connectivity means that users of a certain digital technology can connect easily with other users other applications or even other enterprises In the case of autonomous vehicles it is essential for them to connect with other devices in order to function most effectively Autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other autonomous vehicles and roadside units to provide them amongst other things with information about road work or traffic congestion In addition scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connect and manage each individual autonomous vehicle as it navigates through an intersection This type of connectivity must replace traffic lights and stop signs 66 These types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of autonomous vehicles to understand and cooperate with other products and services such as intersection computer systems in the autonomous vehicles market This could lead to a network of autonomous vehicles all using the same network and information available on that network Eventually this can lead to more autonomous vehicles using the network because the information has been validated through the usage of other autonomous vehicles Such movements will strengthen the value of the network and is called network externalities Reprogrammable edit Another characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities instead of the chassis and its engine This is because autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner eg update in better distinguishing blind person vs nonblind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person A characteristic of this reprogrammable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier because through machine learning smart autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly eg new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software This also implies that autonomous vehicles are never finished because the product can continuously be improved Digital traces edit Autonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars As said this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles andor roadside units This implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new to be determined products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles driving ability or safety Modularity edit Traditional vehicles and their accompanying technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete and unlike autonomous vehicles they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced As said autonomous vehicles are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished This is because autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices networks services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces 1 The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer This layer consists of the following two parts logical capability and physical machinery The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself eg chassis and carrosserie When it comes to digital technologies the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous The logical capability provides control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers 2 On top of the device layer comes the network layer This layer also consists of two different parts physical transport and logical transmission The physical transport layer refers to the radars sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information Next to that the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables the computational power of a network or platform 3 The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle and its owners as they extract create store and consume content with regards to their own driving history traffic congestion roads or parking abilities for example and 4 The final layer of the model is the contents layer This layer contains the sounds images and videos The autonomous vehicles store extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the contents origin ownership copyright encoding methods content tags geotime stamps and so on Yoo et al 2010 The consequence of layered modular architecture of autonomous vehicles and other digital technologies is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product andor certain modules of that product Traditionally automotive vehicles were developed manufactured and maintained by traditional manufacturers Nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of autonomous vehicles Human factor challenges edit Selfdriving cars are already exploring the difficulties of determining the intentions of pedestrians bicyclists and animals and models of behavior must be programmed into driving algorithms 7 Human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of autonomous vehicles where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals Driveai is testing a solution to this problem that involves LED signs mounted on the outside of the vehicle announcing status such as going now dont cross vs waiting for you to cross 67 Two humanfactor challenges are important for safety One is the handoff from automated driving to manual driving which may become necessary due to unfavorable or unusual road conditions or if the vehicle has limited capabilities A sudden handoff could leave a human driver dangerously unprepared in the moment In the long term humans who have less practice at driving might have a lower skill level and thus be more dangerous in manual mode The second challenge is known as risk compensation as a system is perceived to be safer instead of benefiting entirely from all of the increased safety people engage in riskier behavior and enjoy other benefits Semiautomated cars have been shown to suffer from this problem for example with users of Tesla Autopilot ignoring the road and using electronic devices or other activities against the advice of the company that the car is not capable of being completely autonomous In the near future pedestrians and bicyclists may travel in the street in a riskier fashion if they believe selfdriving cars are capable of avoiding them In order for people to buy selfdriving cars and vote for the government to allow them on roads the technology must be trusted as safe 68 69 Selfdriving elevators were invented in 1900 but the high number of people refusing to use them slowed adoption for several decades until operator strikes increased demand and trust was built with advertising and features like the emergency stop button 70 71 Testing edit A prototype of Waymo s selfdriving car navigating public streets in Mountain View California in 2017 The testing of vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be carried out either physically in a closed environment 72 or where permitted on public roads typically requiring a license or permit 73 or adhering to a specific set of operating principles 74 or in a virtual environment ie using computer simulations 75 76 When driven on public roads automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and take over when needed For example New York state has strict requirements for the test driver such that the vehicle can be corrected at all times by a licensed operator highlighted by Cardian Cube Companys application and discussions with New York State officials and the NYS DMV 77 Apple is testing selfdriving cars and has increased its fleet of test vehicles from three in April 2017 to 27 in January 2018 and 45 by March 2018 78 79 Russian internetcompany Yandex started to develop selfdriving cars in 2016 In February 2018 they tested the prototype of an unmanned taxi on the streets of Moscow 80 In June 2018 a Yandex selfdriving vehicle completed a 485mile 780km trip on a federal highway from Moscow to Kazan staying in autonomous mode for 99 of the time 81 82 In August 2018 Yandextaxi began working with selfdriving cars in the Russian town of Innopolis and they plan to operate two unmanned vehicles with five stops within the town 83 In Las Vegas in January 2019 Yandex tested an unmanned vehicle for the first time outside Russia Testing continued during the international Consumer Electronics Show between 8 and 11 January 84 Yandex received permission from the Israeli Ministry of Transport to test the companys unmanned vehicle on the public roads in 2019 85 The progress of automated vehicles can be assessed by computing the average distance driven between disengagements when the automated system is switched off typically by the intervention of a human driver In 2017 Waymo reported 63 disengagements over 352545mi 567366km of testing an average distance of 5596mi 9006km between disengagements the highest among companies reporting such figures Waymo also traveled a greater total distance than any of the other companies Their 2017 rate of 018 disengagements per 1000mi 1600km was an improvement over the 02 disengagements per 1000mi 1600km in 2016 and 08 in 2015 In March 2017 Uber reported an average of just 067mi 108km per disengagement In the final three months of 2017 Cruise now owned by GM averaged 5224mi 8407km per disengagement over a total distance of 62689mi 100888km 86 In July 2018 the first electric driverless racing car Robocar completed a 18kilometer track using its navigation system and artificial intelligence 87 Miles per disengagement Car maker 2016 86 2018 88 000 Distance between

Autonomous truck Further information Online food ordering Companies such as Otto and Starsky Robotics have focused on autonomous trucks Automation of trucks is important not only due to the improved safety aspects of these very heavy vehicles but also due to the ability of fuel savings through platooning Autonomous vans are being used by online grocers such as Ocado Transport systems edit In Europe cities in Belgium France Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport systems for automated cars 89 90 91 and Germany the Netherlands and Spain have allowed public testing in traffic In 2015 the UK launched public trials of the LUTZ Pathfinder automated pod in Milton Keynes 92 Beginning in summer 2015 the French government allowed PSA PeugeotCitroen to make trials in real conditions in the Paris area The experiments were planned to be extended to other cities such as Bordeaux and Strasbourg by 2016 93 The alliance between French companies THALES and Valeo provider of the first selfparking car system that equips Audi and Mercedes premi is testing its own system 94 New Zealand is planning to use automated vehicles for public transport in Tauranga and Christchurch 95 96 97 98 In China Baidu and King Long produce automated minibus a vehicle with 14 seats but without driving seat With 100 vehicles produced 2018 will be the first year with commercial automated service in China 99 100 Impact edit According to a 2020 study selfdriving cars will increase productivity and housing affordability as well as reclaim land used for parking 101 However selfdriving cars will cause greater energy use traffic congestion and sprawl 101 Potential advantages edit Safety edit Driving safety experts predict that once driverless technology has been fully developed traffic collisions and resulting deaths and injuries and costs caused by human error such as delayed reaction time tailgating rubbernecking and other forms of distracted or aggressive driving should be substantially reduced 1 102 103 104 105 Consulting firm McKinsey Company estimated that widespread use of autonomous vehicles could eliminate 90 of all auto accidents in the United States prevent up to US190 billion in damages and healthcosts annually and save thousands of lives 106 According to motorist website TheDrivecom operated by Time magazine none of the driving safety experts they were able to contact were able to rank driving under an autopilot system at the time 2017 as having achieved a greater level of safety than traditional fully handson driving so the degree to which these benefits asserted by proponents will manifest in practice cannot be assessed 107 Confounding factors that could reduce the net effect on safety may include unexpected interactions between humans and partly or fully automated vehicles or between different types of vehicle system complications at the boundaries of functionality at each automation level such as handover when the vehicle reaches the limit of its capacity the effect of the bugs and flaws that inevitably occur in complex interdependent software systems sensor or data shortcomings and successful compromise by malicious interveners To help reduce the possibility of these confounding factors some companies have begun to opensource parts of their driverless systems Udacity for instance is developing an opensource software stack 108 and some companies are having similar approaches 109 110 Welfare edit Automated cars could reduce labor costs 111 112 relieve travelers from driving and navigation chores thereby replacing behindthewheel commuting hours with more time for leisure or work 102 105 and also would lift constraints on occupant ability to drive distracted and texting while driving intoxicated prone to seizures or otherwise impaired 113 114 115 For the young the elderly people with disabilities and lowincome citizens automated cars could provide enhanced mobility 116 117 118 The removal of the steering wheelalong with the remaining driver interface and the requirement for any occupant to assume a forwardfacing positionwould give the interior of the cabin greater ergonomic flexibility Large vehicles such as motorhomes would attain appreciably enhanced ease of use 119 Traffic edit Additional advantages could include higher speed limits 120 smoother rides 121 and increased roadway capacity and minimized traffic congestion due to decreased need for safety gaps and higher speeds 122 123 Currently maximum controlledaccess highway throughput or capacity according to the US Highway Capacity Manual is about 2200 passenger vehicles per hour per lane with about 5 of the available road space is taken up by cars One study estimated that automated cars could increase capacity by 273 8200 cars per hour per lane The study also estimated that with 100 connected vehicles using vehicletovehicle communication capacity could reach 12000 passenger vehicles per hour up 545 from 2200pch per lane traveling safely at 120kmh 75mph with a following gap of about 6m 20ft of each other Human drivers at highway speeds keep between 40 to 50m 130 to 160ft away from the vehicle in front These increases in highway capacity could have a significant impact in traffic congestion particularly in urban areas and even effectively end highway congestion in some places 124 The ability for authorities to manage traffic flow would increase given the extra data and driving behavior predictability 125 combined with less need for traffic police and even road signage Lower costs edit Safer driving is expected to reduce the costs of vehicle insurance 111 126 failed verification Energy and environmental impacts edit Vehicle automation can improve fuel economy of the car by optimizing the drive cycle 127 Reduced traffic congestion and the improvements in traffic flow due to widespread use of automated cars will translate into higher fuel efficiency 128 Additionally selfdriving cars will be able to accelerate and brake more efficiently meaning higher fuel economy from reducing wasted energy typically associated with inefficient changes to speed However the improvement in vehicle energy efficiency does not necessarily translate to net reduction in energy consumption and positive environmental outcomes It is expected that convenience of the automated vehicles encourages the consumers to travel more and this induced demand may partially or fully offset the fuel efficiency improvement brought by automation 127 Overall the consequences of vehicle automation on global energy demand and emissions are highly uncertain and heavily depends on the combined effect of changes in consumer behavior policy intervention technological progress and vehicle technology 127 Parking space edit Manually driven vehicles are reported to be used only 45 of the time and being parked and unused for the remaining 9596 of the time 129 130 Autonomous taxis could on the other hand be used continuously after it has reached its destination This could dramatically reduce the need for parking space For example in Los Angeles a 2015 study found 14 of the land is used for parking alone equivalent to some 1702 hectares 4210 acres 131 132 This combined with the potential reduced need for road space due to improved traffic flow could free up large amounts of land in urban areas which could then be used for parks recreational areas buildings among other uses making cities more livable Besides this privately owned selfdriving cars also capable of selfparking would provide another advantage the ability to drop off and pick up passengers even in places where parking is prohibited This would benefit park and ride facilities 133 Related effects edit By reducing the labor and other costs of mobility as a service automated cars could reduce the number of cars that are individually owned replaced by taxipooling and other carsharing services 134 135 This would also dramatically reduce the size of the automotive production industry with corresponding environmental and economic effects Assuming the increased efficiency is not fully offset by increases in demand more efficient traffic flow could free roadway space for other uses such as better support for pedestrians and cyclists The vehicles increased awareness could aid the police by reporting on illegal passenger behavior while possibly enabling other crimes such as deliberately crashing into another vehicle or a pedestrian 136 However this may also lead to much expanded mass surveillance if there is wide access granted to third parties to the large data sets generated Potential disadvantages edit See also Computer security Automobiles A direct impact of widespread adoption of automated vehicles is the loss of drivingrelated jobs in the road transport industry 1 111 112 137 There could be resistance from professional drivers and unions who are threatened by job losses 138 In addition there could be job losses in public transit services and crash repair shops The automobile insurance industry might suffer as the technology makes certain aspects of these occupations obsolete 118 A frequently cited paper by Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey found that automated cars would make many jobs redundant 139 Privacy could be an issue when having the vehicles location and position integrated into an interface that other people have access to 1 140 In addition there is the risk of automotive hacking through the sharing of information through V2V Vehicle to Vehicle and V2I Vehicle to Infrastructure protocols 141 142 143 There is also the risk of terrorist attacks Selfdriving cars could potentially be loaded with explosives and used as bombs 144 The lack of stressful driving more productive time during the trip and the potential savings in travel time and cost could become an incentive to live far away from cities where housing is cheaper and work in the citys core thus increasing travel distances and inducing more urban sprawl raising energy consumption and enlarging the carbon footprint of urban travel 127 145 146 There is also the risk that traffic congestion might increase rather than decrease 127 118 Appropriate public policies and regulations such as zoning pricing and urban design are required to avoid the negative impacts of increased suburbanization and longer distance travel 118 146 Some who believe that once automation in vehicles reaches higher levels and becomes reliable drivers will pay less attention to the road 147 Research shows that drivers in automated cars react later when they have to intervene in a critical situation compared to if they were driving manually 148 Depending on the capabilities of automated vehicles and the frequency with which human intervention is needed this may counteract any increase in safety as compared to allhuman driving that may be delivered by other factors Ethical and moral reasoning come into consideration when programming the software that decides what action the car takes in an unavoidable crash whether the automated car will crash into a bus potentially killing people inside or swerve elsewhere potentially killing its own passengers or nearby pedestrians 149 A question that programmers of AI systems find difficult to answer is what decision should the car make that causes the smallest damage to peoples lives Adding to the challenge of determining machine ethics is the fact that morality is not universal 7 150 The ethics of automated vehicles are still being articulated and may lead to controversy 151 They may also require closer consideration of the variability contextdependency complexity and nondeterministic nature of human ethics Different human drivers make various ethical decisions when driving such as avoiding harm to themselves or putting themselves at risk to protect others These decisions range from rare extremes such as selfsacrifice or criminal negligence to routine decisions good enough to keep the traffic flowing but bad enough to cause accidents road rage and stress Human thought and reaction time may sometimes be too slow to detect the risk of an upcoming fatal crash think through the ethical implications of the available options or take an action to implement an ethical choice Whether a particular automated vehicles capacity to correctly detect an upcoming risk analyse the options or choose a good option from among bad choices would be as good or better than a particular humans may be difficult to predict or assess This difficulty may be in part because the level of automated vehicle system understanding of the ethical issues at play in a given road scenario sensed for an instant from out of a continuous stream of synthetic physical predictions of the near future and dependent on layers of pattern recognition and situational intelligence may be opaque to human inspection because of its origins in probabilistic machine learning rather than a simple plain English human values logic of parsable rules The depth of understanding predictive power and ethical sophistication needed will be hard to implement and even harder to test or assess The scale of this challenge may have other effects There may be few entities able to marshal the resources and AI capacity necessary to meet it as well as the capital necessary to take an automated vehicle system to market and sustain it operationally for the life of a vehicle and the legal capacity to deal with the potential for liability for a significant proportion of traffic accidents This may have the effect of narrowing the number of different system operators and eroding the diverse global vehicle market down to a small number of system suppliers Potential limits or obstacles edit The sort of hopedfor potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described may be limited by foreseeable challenges such as disputes over liability 152 153 the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from nonautomated to automated 154 and thus a long period of humans and autonomous vehicles sharing the roads resistance by individuals to having to forfeit control of their cars 155 concerns about the safety of driverless in practice 156 and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for selfdriving cars 157 Other obstacles could include deskilling and lower levels of driver experience for dealing with potentially dangerous situations and anomalies 158 ethical problems where an automated vehicles software is forced during an unavoidable crash to choose between multiple harmful courses of action the trolley problem 159 160 161 concerns about making large numbers of people currently employed as drivers unemployed the potential for more intrusive mass surveillance of location association and travel as a result of police and intelligence agency access to large data sets generated by sensors and patternrecognition AI and possibly insufficient understanding of verbal sounds gestures and nonverbal cues by police other drivers or pedestrians 162 Possible technological obstacles for automated cars are Artificial Intelligence is still not able to function properly in chaotic innercity environments 163 A cars computer could potentially be compromised as could a communication system between cars 164 165 166 167 168 Susceptibility of the cars sensing and navigation systems to different types of weather such as snow or deliberate interference including jamming and spoofing 162 Avoidance of large animals requires recognition and tracking and Volvo found that software suited to caribou deer and elk was ineffective with kangaroos 169 Autonomous cars may require very highquality specialised maps to operate properly Where these maps may be out of date they would need to be able to fall back to reasonable behaviors Competition for the radio spectrum desired for the cars communication 170 Field programmability for the systems will require careful evaluation of product development and the component supply chain 168 Current road infrastructure may need changes for automated cars to function optimally 171 Social challenges include Government overregulation or even uncertainty about potential future regulation may delay deployment of automated cars on the road 172 Employment Companies working on the technology have an increasing recruitment problem in that the available talent pool has not grown with demand 173 As such education and training by thirdparty organisations such as providers of online courses and selftaught communitydriven projects such as DIY Robocars 174 and Formula Pi have quickly grown in popularity while university level extracurricular programmes such as Formula Student Driverless 175 have bolstered graduate experience Industry is steadily increasing freely available information sources such as code 176 datasets 177 and glossaries 178 to widen the recruitment pool Potential changes for different industries edit The traditional automobile industry is subject to changes driven by technology and market demands These changes include breakthrough technological advances and when the market demands and adopts new technology quickly In the rapid advance of both factors the end of the era of incremental change was recognized When the transition is made to a new technology new entrants to the automotive industry present themselves which can be distinguished as mobility providers such as Uber and Lyft as well as tech giants such as Google and Nvidia As new entrants to the industry arise market uncertainty naturally occurs due to the changing dynamics For example the entrance of tech giants as well as the alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers causes a variation in the innovation and production process of autonomous vehicles Additionally the entrance of mobility providers has caused ambiguous user preferences As a result of the rise of mobility providers the number of vehicles per capita has flatlined In addition the rise of the sharing economy also contributes to market uncertainty and causes forecasters to question whether personal ownership of vehicles is still relevant as new transportation technology and mobility providers are becoming preferred among consumers Taxis edit With the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the personal ownership of autonomous vehicles it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue as it rises in popularity Established providers such as Uber and Lyft are already significantly present within the industry and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise 179 Healthcare car repair and car insurance edit With the increasing reliance of autonomous vehicles on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of realtime maps driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions 7 Numbers made available by the US government state that 94 of the vehicle accidents are due to human failures As a result major implications for the healthcare industry become apparent Numbers from the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on US roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident reveal that an estimated US500 billion loss may be imminent for the US healthcare industry when autonomous vehicles are dominating the roads It is likely the anticipated decrease in traffic accidents will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources As collisions are less likely to occur and the risk for human errors is reduced significantly the repair industry will face an enormous reduction of work that has to be done on the reparation of car frames Meanwhile as the generated data of the autonomous vehicle is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance car owners and the repair industry will be able to proactively replace a part that will fail soon This Asset Efficiency Service would implicate a productivity gain for the automotive repair industry As fewer collisions implicate less money spent on repair costs the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers which is positive for the industry but fewer payouts may imply a demand drop for insurances in general The insurance industry may have to create new insurance models in the near future to accommodate the changes An unexpected disadvantage of the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles would be a reduction in organs available for transplant 180 Rescue emergency response and military edit The technique used in autonomous driving also ensures life savings in other industries The implementation of autonomous vehicles with rescue emergency response and military applications has already led to a decrease in deaths citation needed Military personnel use autonomous vehicles to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel food and general supplies and even rescue people In addition a future implication of adopting autonomous vehicles could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel which will lead to a decrease in injuries since the technological development allows autonomous vehicles to become more and more autonomous Another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when autonomous vehicles are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances An advantage could be the use of realtime traffic information and other generated data to determine and execute routes more efficiently than human drivers The time savings can be invaluable in these situations 181 Interior design and entertainment edit With the driver decreasingly focused on operating a vehicle the interior design and mediaentertainment industry will have to reconsider what passengers of autonomous vehicles are doing when they are on the road Vehicles need to be redesigned and possibly even be prepared for multipurpose usage In practice it will show that travelers have more time for business andor leisure In both cases this gives increasing opportunities for the mediaentertainment industry to demand attention Moreover the advertisement business is able to provide location based ads without risking driver safety 182 Telecommunication and energy edit All cars can benefit from information and connections but autonomous cars Will be fully capable of operating without CV2X 183 In addition the earlier mentioned entertainment industry is also highly dependent on this network to be active in this market segment This implies higher revenues for the telecommunication industry Since many autonomous vehicles are going to rely on electricity to operate the demand for lithium batteries increases Similarly radar sensors lidar and highspeed internet connectivity require higher auxiliary power from vehicles which manifests as greater power draw from batteries 127 The larger battery requirement causes a necessary increase in supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry On the other hand with the expected increase of battery powered autonomous vehicles the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand As this implication depends on the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry This transition phase of oil to electricity allows companies to explore whether there are business opportunities for them in the new energy ecosystem Restaurant hotels and airlines edit Driver interactions with the vehicle will be less common within the near future and in the more distant future the responsibility will lie entirely with the vehicle As indicated above this will have implications for the entertainment and interior design industry For roadside restaurants the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish and the autonomous vehicle will have a double function Moreover accompanied with the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry the fast increase of developments within the autonomous vehicle industry might cause another implication for their customer bases In the more distant future the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur since autonomous vehicles could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms The improvements regarding the interior of the vehicles might additionally have implications for the airline industry In the case of relatively shorthaul flights waiting times at customs or the gate imply lost time and hassle for customers With the improved convenience in future car travel it is possible that customers might go for this option causing a loss in customer bases for airline industry 184 Elderly and disabled edit The elderly and persons with disabilities such as persons who are hearingimpaired visionimpaired mobilityimpaired or cognitivelyimpaired are potential beneficiaries of adoption of autonomous vehicles however the extent to which such populations gain greater mobility from the adoption of AV technology depends on the specific designs and regulations adopted 185 186 Children edit Further information Student transport Children and teens who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves are also benefiting of the introduction of autonomous cars when Daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick up and drop off systems by car in addition to walking cycling and busing causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers The extent to which human actions are necessary for driving will vanish Since current vehicles require human actions to some extent the driving school industry will not be disrupted until the majority of autonomous transportation is switched to the emerged dominant design It is plausible that in the distant future driving a vehicle will be considered as a luxury which implies that the structure of the industry is based on new entrants and a new market 187 Incidents edit See also List of selfdriving car fatalities Tesla Autopilot edit Main article Tesla Autopilot In midOctober 2015 Tesla Motors rolled out version 7 of their software in the US that included Tesla Autopilot capability 188 On 9 January 2016 Tesla rolled out version 71 as an overtheair update adding a new summon feature that allows cars to selfpark at parking locations without the driver in the car 189 Teslas automated driving features is currently classified as a Level 2 driver assistance system according to the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE five levels of vehicle automation At this level the car can be automated but requires the full attention of the driver who must be prepared to take control at a moments notice 190 191 192 193 Autopilot should be used only on limitedaccess highways and sometimes it will fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself In urban driving the system will not read traffic signals or obey stop signs The system also does not detect pedestrians or cyclists 194 Tesla Model S Autopilot system in use in July 2016 it was only suitable for limitedaccess highways not for urban driving Among other limitations it could not detect pedestrians or cyclists 194 On 20 January 2016 the first known fatal crash of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred in Chinas Hubei province According to Chinas 163com news channel this marked Chinas first accidental death due to Teslas automatic driving system Initially Tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on Autopilot at the time however 163com pointed out that other factors such as the cars absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high speed crash and the drivers otherwise good driving record seemed to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on Autopilot at the time A similar fatal crash occurred four months later in Florida 195 196 In 2018 in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla Tesla did not deny that the car had been on Autopilot at the time of the accident and sent evidence to the victims father documenting that fact 197 The second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in Williston Florida on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S electric car was engaged in Autopilot mode The occupant was killed in a crash with an 18wheel tractortrailer On 28 June 2016 the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol According to NHTSA preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractortrailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a noncontrolled access highway and the car failed to apply the brakes The car continued to travel after passing under the trucks trailer 198 199 NHTSAs preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash which involved a population of an estimated 25000 Model S cars 200 On 8 July 2016 NHTSA requested Tesla Motors provide the agency detailed information about the design operation and testing of its Autopilot technology The agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to Autopilot since its introduction and Teslas planned updates schedule for the next four months 201 According to Tesla neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractortrailer against a brightly lit sky so the brake was not applied The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S Tesla also claimed that this was Teslas first known autopilot death in over 130million miles 210million kilometers driven by its customers with Autopilot engaged however by this statement Tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the January 2016 fatality in Hubei China had also been the result of an autopilot system error According to Tesla there is a fatality every 94million miles 151million kilometers among all type of vehicles in the US 198 199 202 However this number also includes fatalities of the crashes for instance of motorcycle drivers with pedestrians 203 204 In July 2016 the US National Transportation Safety Board NTSB opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while the Autopilot was engaged The NTSB is an investigative body that has the power to make only policy recommendations An agency spokesman said Its worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible 205 In January 2017 the NTSB released the report that concluded Tesla was not at fault the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed 206 According to Tesla starting 19 October 2016 all Tesla cars are built with hardware to allow full selfdriving capability at the highest safety level SAE Level 5 207 The hardware includes eight surround cameras and twelve ultrasonic sensors in addition to the forwardfacing radar with enhanced processing capabilities 208 The system will operate in shadow mode processing without taking action and send data back to Tesla to improve its abilities until the software is ready for deployment via overtheair upgrades 209 After the required testing Tesla hopes to enable full selfdriving by the end of 2019 under certain conditions Waymo edit Googles inhouse automated car Waymo originated as a selfdriving car project within Google In August 2012 Google announced that their vehicles had completed over 300000 automateddriving miles 500000km accidentfree typically involving about a dozen cars on the road at any given time and that they were starting to test with single drivers instead of in pairs 210 In lateMay 2014 Google revealed a new prototype that had no steering wheel gas pedal or brake pedal and was fully automated 211 As of March2016 update Google had testdriven their fleet in automated mode a total of 1500000mi 2400000km 212 In December 2016 Google Corporation announced that its technology would be spun off to a new company called Waymo with both Google and Waymo becoming subsidiaries of a new parent company called Alphabet 213 214 According to Googles accident reports as of early 2016 their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions of which other drivers were at fault 13 times although in 2016 the cars software caused a crash 215 In June 2015 Brin confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date Eight involved rearend collisions at a stop sign or traffic light two in which the vehicle was sideswiped by another driver one in which another driver rolled through a stop sign and one where a Google employee was controlling the car manually 216 In July 2015 three Google employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rearended by a car whose driver failed to brake at a traffic light This was the first time that a collision resulted in injuries 217 On 14 February 2016 a Google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path During the maneuver it struck a bus Google stated In this case we clearly bear some responsibility because if our car hadnt moved there wouldnt have been a collision 218 219 Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience No injuries were reported in the crash 215 Uber edit In March 2017 an Uber test vehicle was involved in a crash in Tempe Arizona when another car failed to yield flipping the Uber vehicle There were no injuries in the accident 220 By 22 December 2017 Uber had completed 2million miles 32million kilometers in automated mode 221 On 18 March 2018 Elaine Herzberg became the first pedestrian to be killed by a selfdriving car in the United States after being hit by an Uber vehicle also in Tempe Herzberg was crossing outside of a crosswalk approximately 400 feet from an intersection 222 This marks the first time an individual outside an autopiloted car is known to have been killed by such a car The first death of an essentially uninvolved third party is likely to raise new questions and concerns about the safety of automated cars in general 223 Some experts say a human driver could have avoided the fatal crash 224 Arizona Governor Doug Ducey later suspended the companys ability to test and operate its automated cars on public roadways citing an unquestionable failure of the expectation that Uber make public safety its top priority 225 Uber has pulled out of all selfdrivingcar testing in California as a result of the accident 226 On 24 May 2018 the US National Transport Safety Board issued a preliminary report 227 Navya automated bus driving system edit On 9 November 2017 a Navya automated selfdriving bus with passengers was involved in a crash with a truck The truck was found to be at fault of the crash reversing into the stationary automated bus The automated bus did not take evasive actions or apply defensive driving techniques such as flashing its headlights or sounding the horn As one passenger commented The shuttle didnt have the ability to move back The shuttle just stayed still 228 Policy implications edit Urban planning edit According to a Wonkblog reporter if fully automated cars become commercially available they have the potential to be a disruptive innovation with major implications for society The likelihood of widespread adoption is still unclear but if they are used on a wide scale policy makers face a number of unresolved questions about their effects 171 One fundamental question is about their effect on travel behavior Some people believe that they will increase car ownership and car use because it will become easier to use them and they will ultimately be more useful 171 This may in turn encourage urban sprawl and ultimately total private vehicle use Others argue that it will be easier to share cars and that this will thus discourage outright ownership and decrease total usage and make cars more efficient forms of transportation in relation to the present situation 229 230 Policymakers will have to take a new look at how infrastructure is to be built and how money will be allotted to build for automated vehicles The need for traffic signals could potentially be reduced with the adoption of smart highways 231 Due to smart highways and with the assistance of smart technological advances implemented by policy change the dependence on oil imports may be reduced because of less time being spent on the road by individual cars which could have an effect on policy regarding energy 232 On the other hand automated vehicles could increase the overall number of cars on the road which could lead to a greater dependence on oil imports if smart systems are not enough to curtail the impact of more vehicles 233 However due to the uncertainty of the future of automated vehicles policy makers may want to plan effectively by implementing infrastructure improvements that can be beneficial to both human drivers and automated vehicles 234 Caution needs to be taken in acknowledgment to public transportation and that the use may be greatly reduced if automated vehicles are catered to through policy reform of infrastructure with this resulting in job loss and increased unemployment 235 Other disruptive effects will come from the use of automated vehicles to carry goods Selfdriving vans have the potential to make home deliveries significantly cheaper transforming retail commerce and possibly making hypermarkets and supermarkets redundant As of 2019 update the US Department of Transportation defines automation into six levels starting at level zero which means the human driver does everything and ending with level five the automated system performs all the driving tasks Also under the current law manufacturers bear all the responsibility to selfcertify vehicles for use on public roads This means that currently as long as the vehicle is compliant within the regulatory framework there are no specific federal legal barriers in the US to a highly automated vehicle being offered for sale Iyad Rahwan an associate professor in the MIT Media Lab said Most people want to live in a world where cars will minimize casualties but everyone wants their own car to protect them at all costs Furthermore industry standards and best practice are still needed in systems before they can be considered reasonably safe under realworld conditions 236 Researchers have pushed against this arguing that selfdriving cars will have a deeply negative impact on urban life especially if they are programmed to kill Moreover they require a sensorbased infrastructure that would constitute an allencompassing surveillance apparatus 237 They would also exasperate existing mobility inequalities 238 driven by the interests of car companies and technology companies while taking investment away from more equatable and sustainable mobility initiatives such as public transportation Legislation edit The 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic subscribed to by over 70 countries worldwide establishes principles to govern traffic laws One of the fundamental principles of the convention has been the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behavior of a vehicle in traffic 239 The progress of technology that assists and takes over the functions of the driver is undermining this principle implying that much of the groundwork must be rewritten Legal status in the United States edit US states that allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads as of March2016 update In the United States a nonsignatory country to the Vienna Convention state vehicle codes generally do not envisagebut do not necessarily prohibithighly automated vehicles as of 2012 update 240 241 To clarify the legal status of and otherwise regulate such vehicles several states have enacted or are considering specific laws 242 By 2016 seven states Nevada California Florida Michigan Hawaii Washington and Tennessee along with the District of Columbia have enacted laws for automated vehicles Incidents such as the first fatal accident by Teslas Autopilot system have led to discussion about revising laws and standards for automated cars In September 2016 the US National Economic Council and US Department of Transportation released federal standards that describe how automated vehicles should react if their technology fails how to protect passenger privacy and how riders should be protected in the event of an accident The new federal guidelines are meant to avoid a patchwork of state laws while avoiding being so overbearing as to stifle innovation 243 In June 2011 the Nevada Legislature passed a law to authorize the use of automated cars Nevada thus became the first jurisdiction in the world where automated vehicles might be legally operated on public roads According to the law the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles is responsible for setting safety and performance standards and the agency is responsible for designating areas where automated cars may be tested 244 245 246 This legislation was supported by Google in an effort to legally conduct further testing of its Google driverless car 247 The Nevada law defines an automated vehicle to be a motor vehicle that uses artificial intelligence sensors and global positioning system coordinates to drive itself without the active intervention of a human operator The law also acknowledges that the operator will not need to pay attention while the car is operating itself Google had further lobbied for an exemption from a ban on distracted driving to permit occupants to send text messages while sitting behind the wheel but this did not become law 247 248 249 Furthermore Nevadas regulations require a person behind the wheel and one in the passengers seat during tests 250 In April 2012 Florida became the second state to allow the testing of automated cars on public roads and California became the third when Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law at Google Headquarters in Mountain View 251 252 In December 2013 Michigan became the fourth state to allow testing of driverless cars on public roads 253 In July 2014 the city of Coeur dAlene Idaho adopted a robotics ordinance that includes provisions to allow for selfdriving cars 254 A Toyota Prius modified by Google to operate as a driverless car On 19 February 2016 California Assembly Bill 2866 was introduced in California that would allow automated vehicles to operate on public roads including those without a driver steering wheel accelerator pedal or brake pedal The bill states that the California Department of Motor Vehicles would need to comply with these regulations by 1 July 2018 for these rules to take effect As of November2016 update this bill has yet to pass the house of origin 255 In September 2016 the US Department of Transportation released its Federal Automated Vehicles Policy and California published discussions on the subject in October 2016 256 257 In December 2016 the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered Uber to remove its selfdriving vehicles from the road in response to two redlight violations Uber immediately blamed the violations on humanerror and has suspended the drivers 258 Legislation in Europe edit In 2013 the government of the United Kingdom permitted the testing of automated cars on public roads 259 Before this all testing of robotic vehicles in the UK had been conducted on private property 259 In 2014 the Government of France announced that testing of automated cars on public roads would be allowed in 2015 2000km of road would be opened through the national territory especially in Bordeaux in Isère ÎledeFrance and Strasbourg At the 2015 ITS World Congress a conference dedicated to intelligent transport systems the very first demonstration of automated vehicles on open road in France was carried out in Bordeaux in early October 2015 260 In 2015 a preemptive lawsuit against various automobile companies such as GM Ford and Toyota accused them of Hawking vehicles that are vulnerable to hackers who could hypothetically wrest control of essential functions such as brakes and steering 261 In spring of 2015 the Federal Department of Environment Transport Energy and Communications in Switzerland UVEK allowed Swisscom to test a driverless Volkswagen Passat on the streets of Zurich 262 As of April 2017 it is possible to conduct public road tests for development vehicles in Hungary furthermore the construction of a closed test track the ZalaZone test track 263 suitable for testing highly automated functions is also under way near the city of Zalaegerszeg 264 Legislation in Asia edit In 2016 the Singapore Land Transit Authority in partnership with UK automotive supplier Delphi Automotive began launch preparations for a test run of a fleet of automated taxis for an ondemand automated cab service to take effect in 2017 265 In 2017 the South Korean government stated that the lack of universal standards is preventing its own legislation from pushing new domestic rules However once the international standards are settled South Koreas legislation will resemble the international standards 266 Liability edit Main article Selfdriving car liability Selfdriving car liability is a developing area of law and policy that will determine who is liable when an automated car causes physical damage to persons or breaks road rules 1 267 When automated cars shift the control of driving from humans to automated car technology there may be a need for existing liability laws to evolve in order to fairly identify the parties responsible for damage and injury and to address the potential for conflicts of interest between human occupants system operator insurers and the public purse 118 Increases in the use of automated car technologies eg advanced driverassistance systems may prompt incremental shifts in this responsibility for driving It is claimed by proponents to have potential to affect the frequency of road accidents although it is difficult to assess this claim in the absence of data from substantial actual use 268 If there was a dramatic improvement in safety the operators may seek to project their liability for the remaining accidents onto others as part of their reward for the improvement However there is no obvious reason why they should escape liability if any such effects were found to be modest or nonexistent since part of the purpose of such liability is to give an incentive to the party controlling something to do whatever is necessary to avoid it causing harm Potential users may be reluctant to trust an operator if it seeks to pass its normal liability on to others In any case a welladvised person who is not controlling a car at all Level 5 would be understandably reluctant to accept liability for something out of their control And when there is some degree of sharing control possible Level 3 or 4 a welladvised person would be concerned that the vehicle might try to pass back control at the last seconds before an accident to pass responsibility and liability back too but in circumstances where the potential driver has no better prospects of avoiding the crash than the vehicle since they have not necessarily been paying close attention and if it is too hard for the very smart car it might be too hard for a human Since operators especially those familiar with trying to ignore existing legal obligations under a motto like seek forgiveness not permission such as Waymo or Uber could be normally expected to try to avoid responsibility to the maximum degree possible there is potential for attempt to let the operators evade being held liable for accidents while they are in control As higher levels of automation are commercially introduced Level 3 and 4 the insurance industry may see a greater proportion of commercial and product liability lines while personal automobile insurance shrinks 269 Vehicle communication systems edit Main article Vehicular communication systems Vehicle networking may be desirable due to difficulty with computer vision being able to recognize brake lights turn signals buses and similar things However the usefulness of such systems would be diminished by the fact current cars are equipped with them they may also pose privacy concerns 229 Individual vehicles may benefit from information obtained from other vehicles in the vicinity especially information relating to traffic congestion and safety hazards Vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating nodes in a peertopeer network providing each other with information As a cooperative approach vehicular communication systems can allow all cooperating vehicles to be more effective According to a 2010 study by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration vehicular communication systems could help avoid up to 79 of all traffic accidents 270 There have so far been no complete implementation of peertopeer networking on the scale required for traffic each individual vehicle would have to connect with potentially hundreds of different vehicles that could be going in and out of range citation needed In 2012 computer scientists at the University of Texas in Austin began developing smart intersections designed for automated cars The intersections will have no traffic lights and no stop signs instead using computer programs that will communicate directly with each car on the road 271 In 2017 Researchers from Arizona State University developed a 110 scale intersection and proposed an intersection management technique called Crossroads It was shown that Crossroads is very resilient to network delay of both V2I communication and Worstcase Execution time of the intersection manager 272 In 2018 a robust approach was introduced which is resilient to both model mismatch and external disturbances such as wind and bumps 273 Among connected cars an unconnected one is the weakest link and will be increasingly banned from busy highspeed roads as predicted by the Helsinki think tank Nordic Communications Corporation in January 2016 274 Public opinion surveys edit This article may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that

vehicle owners by JD Power and Associates found 37 initially said they would be interested in purchasing a fully autonomous car However that figure dropped to 20 if told the technology would cost US3000 more 276 In a 2012 survey of about 1000 German drivers by automotive researcher Puls 22 of the respondents had a positive attitude towards these cars 10 were undecided 44 were skeptical and 24 were hostile 277 A 2013 survey of 1500 consumers across 10 countries by Cisco Systems found 57 stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver with Brazil India and China the most willing to trust automated technology 278 In a 2014 US telephone survey by Insurancecom over threequarters of licensed drivers said they would at least consider buying a selfdriving car rising to 86 if car insurance were cheaper 317 said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available instead 279 In a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists 46 predict that either Tesla or Daimler will be the first to the market with a fully autonomous vehicle while at 38 Daimler is predicted to be the most functional safe and indemand autonomous vehicle 280 In 2015 a questionnaire survey by Delft University of Technology explored the opinion of 5000 people from 109 countries on automated driving Results showed that respondents on average found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving 22 of the respondents did not want to spend any money for a fully automated driving system Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hackingmisuse and were also concerned about legal issues and safety Finally respondents from more developed countries in terms of lower accident statistics higher education and higher income were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data 281 The survey also gave results on potential consumer opinion on interest of purchasing an automated car stating that 37 of surveyed current owners were either definitely or probably interested in purchasing an automated car 281 In 2016 a survey in Germany examined the opinion of 1603 people who were representative in terms of age gender and education for the German population towards partially highly and fully automated cars Results showed that men and women differ in their willingness to use them Men felt less anxiety and more joy towards automated cars whereas women showed the exact opposite The gender difference towards anxiety was especially pronounced between young men and women but decreased with participants age 282 In 2016 a PwC survey in the United States showing the opinion of 1584 people highlights that 66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver People are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the car hacked Nevertheless only 13 of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars 283 A Pew Research Center survey of 4135 US adults conducted 115 May 2017 finds that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimesfrom the widespread adoption of automated vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers 284 Results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187 US adults respectively were published in 2019 A new standardised questionnaire the autonomous vehicle acceptance model AVAM was developed including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of different automation levels Results showed that users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use highly autonomous vehicles Additionally partial autonomy regardless of level was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement usage of hands feet and eyes than full autonomy 285 Moral issues edit See also Machine ethics This sections tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia See Wikipedias guide to writing better articles for suggestions February 2019 Learn how and when to remove this template message With the emergence of automated automobiles various ethical issues arise While the introduction of automated vehicles to the mass market is said to be inevitable due to a presumed but untestable potential for reduction of crashes by up to 90 286 and their potential greater accessibility to disabled elderly and young passengers a range of ethical issues have not been fully addressed Those include but are not limited to the moral financial and criminal responsibility for crashes and breaches of law the decisions a car is to make right before a fatal crash privacy issues including potential for mass surveillance potential for massive job losses and unemployment among drivers deskilling and loss of independence by vehicle users exposure to hacking and malware and the further concentration of market and data power in the hands of a few global conglomerates capable of consolidating AI capacity and of lobbying governments to facilitate the shift of liability onto others and their potential destruction of existing occupations and industries There are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash especially with people being hurt Many experts see the car manufacturers themselves responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction 287 Besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues not only due to protection of the brand image but also due to financial and criminal consequences However there are also voices who that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle Experts who suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident 287 Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles and suppliers of components of the AV 288 Taking aside the question of legal liability and moral responsibility the question arises how automated vehicles should be programmed to behave in an emergency situation where either passengers or other traffic participants like pedestrians bicyclists and other drivers are endangered A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software is described in an ethical thought experiment the trolley problem a conductor of a trolley has the choice of staying on the planned track and running over five people or turn the trolley onto a track where it would kill only one person assuming there is no traffic on it 289 When a selfdriving car is in following scenario its driving with passengers and suddenly a person appears in its way The car has to decide between the two options either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall killing the passengers 290 There are two main considerations that need to be addressed First what moral basis would be used by an automated vehicle to make decisions Second how could those be translated into software code Researchers have suggested in particular two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency deontology and utilitarianism 7 291 Asimovs Three Laws of Robotics are a typical example of deontological ethics The theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict writtenout rules that it needs to follow in any situation Utilitarianism suggests the idea that any decision must be made based on the goal to maximize utility This needs a definition of utility which could be maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash 7 291 Many trolley discussions skip over the practical problems of how a probabilistic machine learning vehicle AI could be sophisticated enough to understand that a deep problem of moral philosophy is presenting itself from instant to instant while using a dynamic projection into the near future what sort of moral problem it actually would be if any what the relevant weightings in human value terms should be given to all the other humans involved who will be probably unreliably identified and how reliably it can assess the probable outcomes These practical difficulties and those around testing and assessment of solutions to them may present as much of a challenge as the theoretical abstractions citation needed While most trolley conundrums involve hyperbolic and unlikely fact patterns it is inevitable mundane ethical decisions and risk calculations such as the precise millisecond a car should yield to a yellow light or how closely to drive to a bike lane will need to be programmed into the software of autonomous vehicles 7 292 Algorithms dictate for example how closely to drive to a bike lane or the precise moment an autonomous car should yield to a yellow light 7 292 Mundane ethical situations may even be more relevant than rare fatal circumstances because of the specificity implicated and their large scope 292 Mundane situations involving drivers and pedestrians are so prevalent that in the aggregate produce large amounts of injuries and deaths 292 Hence even incremental permutations of moral algorithms can have a notable effect when considered in their entirety 292 Privacyrelated issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual This information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken voice recording video recording preferences in media that is consumed in the car behavioral patterns to many more streams of information 229 293 294 The data and communications infrastructure needed to support these vehicles may also be capable of surveillance especially if coupled to other data sets and advanced analytics 229 The implementation of automated vehicles to the mass market might cost up to 5 million jobs in the US alone making up almost 3 of the workforce 295 Those jobs include drivers of taxis buses vans trucks and ehailing vehicles Many industries such as the auto insurance industry are indirectly affected This industry alone generates an annual revenue of about US220 billion supporting 277000 jobs 296 To put this into perspectivethis is about the number of mechanical engineering jobs 297 The potential loss of a majority of those jobs will have a tremendous impact on those individuals involved 298 Both India and China have placed bans on automated cars with the former citing protection of jobs citation needed The Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT has animated the trolley problem in the context of autonomous cars in a website called The Moral Machine 299 The Moral Machine generates random scenarios in which autonomous cars malfunction and forces the user to choose between two harmful courses of action 299 MITs Moral Machine experiment has collected data involving over 40 million decisions from people in 233 countries to ascertain peoples moral preferences The MIT study illuminates that ethical preferences vary among cultures and demographics and likely correlate with modern institutions and geographic traits 299 Global trends of the MIT study highlight that overall people prefer to save the lives of humans over other animals prioritize the lives of many rather than few and spare the lives of young rather than old 299 Men are slightly more likely to spare the lives of women and religious affiliates are slightly more likely to prioritize human life The lives of criminals were prioritized more than cats but the lives of dogs were prioritized more than the lives of criminals 300 The lives of homeless were spared more than the elderly but the lives of homeless were spared less often than the obese 300 People overwhelmingly express a preference for autonomous vehicles to be programmed with utilitarian ideas that is in a manner that generates the least harm and minimizes driving casualties 301 While people want others to purchase utilitarian promoting vehicles they themselves prefer to ride in vehicles that prioritize the lives of people inside the vehicle at all costs 301 This presents a paradox in which people prefer that others drive utilitarian vehicles designed to maximize the lives preserved in a fatal situation but want to ride in cars that prioritize the safety of passengers at all costs 301 People disapprove of regulations that promote utilitarian views and would be less willing to purchase a selfdriving car that may opt to promote the greatest good at the expense of its passengers 301 Bonnefon et al conclude that the regulation of autonomous vehicle ethical prescriptions may be counterproductive to societal safety 301 This is because if the government mandates utilitarian ethics and people prefer to ride in selfprotective cars it could prevent the large scale implementation of selfdriving cars 301 Delaying the adoption of autonomous cars vitiates the safety of society as a whole because this technology is projected to save so many lives 301 This is a paradigmatic example of the tragedy of the commons in which rational actors cater to their selfinterested preferences at the expense of societal utility 302 Anticipated
