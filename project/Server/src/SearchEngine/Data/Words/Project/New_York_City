History of New York City and Timeline of New York City Etymology In 1664 the city was named in honor of the Duke of York who would become King James II of England Jamess older brother King Charles II had appointed the Duke proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland including the city of New Amsterdam which England had recently seized from the Dutch 86 Early history During the Wisconsin glaciation 75000 to 11000 years ago the New York City region was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 2000 feet 610m in depth 87 The erosive forward movement of the ice and its subsequent retreat contributed to the separation of what is now Long Island and Staten Island That action also left bedrock at a relatively shallow depth providing a solid foundation for most of Manhattans skyscrapers 88 In the precolonial era the area of presentday New York City was inhabited by Algonquian Native Americans including the Lenape Their homeland known as Lenapehoking included Staten Island Manhattan the Bronx the western portion of Long Island including the areas that would later become the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens and the Lower Hudson Valley 89 The first documented visit into New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown 90 He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoulême New Angoulême 91 A Spanish expedition led by the Portuguese captain Estêvão Gomes sailing for Emperor Charles V arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the Hudson River which he named Río de San Antonio Saint Anthonys River The Padrón Real of 1527 the first scientific map to show the East Coast of North America continuously was informed by Gomes expedition and labeled the northeastern United States as Tierra de Esteban Gómez in his honor 92 Peter Minuit is credited with the purchase of the island of Manhattan in 1626 In 1609 the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered the New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company 93 He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the North River now the Hudson River named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice Prince of Orange Hudsons first mate described the harbor as a very good Harbour for all windes and the river as a mile broad and full of fish 94 Hudson sailed roughly 150 miles 240km north 95 past the site of the presentday New York State capital city of Albany in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue 94 He made a tenday exploration of the area and claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company In 1614 the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay was claimed by the Netherlands and called NieuwNederland New Netherland The first nonNative American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was Juan Rodriguez transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues a merchant from Santo Domingo Born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 161314 trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch Broadway from 159th Street to 218th Street in Upper Manhattan is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor 96 97 Dutch rule New Amsterdam centered in the eventual Lower Manhattan in 1664 the year England took control and renamed it New York A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624 making New York the 12th oldest continuously occupied Europeanestablished settlement in the continental United States 98 with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island In 1625 construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam later called Nieuw Amsterdam New Amsterdam on presentday Manhattan Island 99 100 The colony of New Amsterdam was centered at the site which would eventually become Lower Manhattan It extended from the lower tip of Manhattan to modern day Wall Street where a 12foot wooden stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and British Raids 101 In 1626 the Dutch colonial DirectorGeneral Peter Minuit acting as charged by the Dutch West India Company purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie a small Lenape band 102 for the value of 60 guilders 103 about 900 in 2018 104 A disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for 24 worth of glass beads 105 106 Following the purchase New Amsterdam grew slowly 107 To attract settlers the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628 whereby wealthy Dutchmen patroons or patrons who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swaths of land along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade This program had little success 108 Since 1621 the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland on authority granted by the Dutch States General In 16391640 in an effort to bolster economic growth the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade leading to growth in the production and trade of food timber tobacco and slaves particularly with the Dutch West Indies 107 109 In 1647 Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last DirectorGeneral of New Netherland During his tenure the population of New Netherland grew from 2000 to 8000 110 111 Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony however he also earned a reputation as a despotic leader He instituted regulations on liquor sales attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church and blocked other religious groups including Quakers Jews and Lutherans from establishing houses of worship 112 The Dutch West India Company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between Stuyvesant and residents of New Amsterdam 113 English rule Fort George and the city of New York c 1731 In 1664 unable to summon any significant resistance Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops led by Colonel Richard Nicolls without bloodshed 112 113 The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom 114 The English promptly renamed the fledgling city New York after the Duke of York the future King James II of England 115 The transfer was confirmed in 1667 by the Treaty of Breda which concluded the Second AngloDutch War 116 On August 24 1673 during the Third AngloDutch War Dutch captain Anthony Colve seized the colony of New York from England at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it New Orange after William III the Prince of Orange 117 The Dutch would soon return the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674 118 119 Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizeable population losses for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670 120 By 1700 the Lenape population had diminished to 200 121 New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century losing ten percent of its population to the disease in 1702 alone 122 123 New York grew in importance as a trading port while under British rule in the early 1700s 124 It also became a center of slavery with 42 of households holding slaves by 1730 the highest percentage outside Charleston South Carolina 125 Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves but others hired them out to work at labor Slavery became integrally tied to New Yorks economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port and the banks and shipping tied to the American South Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years 126 The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby helped to establish the freedom of the press in North America 127 In 1754 Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as Kings College in Lower Manhattan 128 American Revolution The Battle of Long Island the largest battle of the American Revolution took place in Brooklyn in 1776 The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty organized in the city skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there 129 The Battle of Long Island the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War was fought in August 1776 within the modernday borough of Brooklyn 130 After the battle in which the Americans were defeated the British made the city their military and political base of operations in North America The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters As many as 10000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation When the British forces evacuated at the close of the war in 1783 they transported 3000 freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia 131 They resettled other freedmen in England and the Caribbean The only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates including Benjamin Franklin and British general Lord Howe on September 11 1776 Shortly after the British occupation began the Great Fire of New York occurred a large conflagration on the West Side of Lower Manhattan which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city including Trinity Church 132 In 1785 the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital shortly after the war New York was the last capital of the US under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States In 1789 the first President of the United States George Washington was inaugurated the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted all at Federal Hall on Wall Street 133 By 1790 New York had surpassed Philadelphia to become the largest city in the United States but by the end of

New York States gradual abolition act of 1799 children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their midtolate twenties 137 138 Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves a significant freeblack population gradually developed in Manhattan Under such influential United States founders as Alexander Hamilton and John Jay the New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate black children 139 It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state and free blacks struggled afterward with discrimination New York interracial abolitionist activism continued among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School The citys black population reached more than 16000 in 1840 140 In the 19th century the city was transformed by development relating to its status as a national and international trading center as well as by European immigration 141 The city adopted the Commissioners Plan of 1811 which expanded the city street grid to encompass almost all of Manhattan The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes 142 Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants 143 Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s including William Cullen Bryant Washington Irving Herman Melville Rufus Wilmot Griswold John Keese Nathaniel Parker Willis and Edgar Allan Poe Publicminded members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city Manhattans Little Italy Lower East Side circa 1900 The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants of whom over 200000 were living in New York by 1860 upwards of a quarter of the citys population 144 There was also extensive immigration from the German provinces where revolutions had disrupted societies and Germans comprised another 25 of New Yorks population by 1860 145 Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office increasing the citys ties to the South and its dominant party In 1861 Mayor Fernando Wood called upon the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded but his proposal was not acted on 139 Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War 18611865 which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a 300 equivalent to 6229 in 2019 commutation fee to hire a substitute 146 led to the Draft Riots of 1863 whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class 139 The situation deteriorated into attacks on New Yorks elite followed by attacks on Black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and black people for work Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the New York Police Department which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants 145 At least 120 people were killed 147 Eleven Black men were lynched over five days and the riots forced hundreds of Blacks to flee the city for Williamsburg Brooklyn and New Jersey The black population in Manhattan fell below 10000 by 1865 which it had last been in 1820 The white working class had established dominance 145 147 Violence by longshoremen against Black men was especially fierce in the docks area 145 It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history 148 Modern history A construction worker atop the Empire State Building as it was being built in 1930 The Chrysler Building is behind him In 1898 the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn until then a separate city the County of New York which then included parts of the Bronx the County of Richmond and the western portion of the County of Queens 149 The opening of the subway in 1904 first built as separate private systems helped bind the new city together 150 Throughout the first half of the 20th century the city became a world center

rights movement 160 161 162 The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous violent demonstrations by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28 1969 at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan 163 They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement 160 164 165 166 and the modern fight for LGBT rights 167 168 Wayne R Dynes author of the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality wrote that drag queens were the only transgender folks around during the June 1969 Stonewall riots None of them in fact made a major contribution to the movement 169 Others say the transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality during the period of the Stonewall riots and thereafter 169 In the 1970s job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates 170 While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the citys economic health in the 1980s New Yorks crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s 171 By the mid 1990s crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies improving economic opportunities gentrification and new residents both American transplants and

distinctive regional speech pattern called the New York dialect alternatively known as Brooklynese or New Yorkese It has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within American English 510 The traditional New York area accent is characterized as nonrhotic so that the sound ɹ does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant therefore the pronunciation of the city name as New Yawk 511 There is no ɹ in words like park pɑək or pɒək with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the lowback chain shift butter bʌɾə or here hiə In another feature called the low back chain shift the ɔ vowel sound of words like talk law cross chocolate and coffee and the often homophonous ɔr in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in General American English In the most oldfashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect the vowel sounds of words like girl and of words like oil became a diphthong ɜɪ This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds so that girl is pronounced goil and oil is pronounced erl this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like Joizey Jersey ToidyToid Street 33rd St and terlet toilet 511 The character Archie Bunker from the 1970s television sitcom All in the Family was an example of having used this pattern of speech The classic version of the New York City dialect is generally centered on middle and workingclass New Yorkers The influx of nonEuropean immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive
