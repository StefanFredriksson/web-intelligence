the first dynasty was the Xia which emerged around 2100 BCE 41 Xia dynasty marked the beginning of Chinas political system based on hereditary monarchies or dynasties which lasted for a millennia 42 The dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites at Erlitou Henan in 1959 43 It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the Xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period 44 The succeeding Shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records 45 The Shang ruled the plain of the Yellow River in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century BCE 46 Their oracle bone script from c 1500 BCE 47 48 represents the oldest form of Chinese writing yet found 49 and is a direct ancestor of modern

eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou no longer fully obeyed the Zhou king and continually waged war with each other in the 300year Spring and Autumn period By the time of the Warring States period of the 5th3rd centuries BCE there were only seven powerful states left Imperial China Chinas first emperor Qin Shi Huang is famed for having united the Warring States walls to form the Great Wall of China Most of the present structure however dates to the Ming dynasty The Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six kingdoms reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty He enacted Qins legalist reforms throughout China notably the forced standardization of Chinese characters measurements road widths ie cart axles length and currency His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi Guangdong and Vietnam 51 The Qin dynasty lasted

from region to region because of the countrys highly complex topography A major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts particularly the Gobi Desert 133 134 Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring which then spread to other parts of East Asia including Japan and Korea Chinas environmental watchdog SEPA stated in 2007 that China is losing 4000km 2 1500sqmi per year to desertification 135 Water

BRICS group of emerging major economies and hosted the groups third official summit at Sanya Hainan in April 2011 199 Under its interpretation of the OneChina policy Beijing has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to Taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the Republic of China Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan 200 especially in the matter of armament sales 201 Diplomatic relations of China Much of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier Zhou Enlai s Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and is also driven by the concept of harmony without uniformity which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences 202 This policy may have led China to support states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by Western nations such as Zimbabwe North Korea and Iran 203 China has a close economic and military relationship with Russia 204 and the two states often vote in unison in the UN Security Council 205 206 207 Trade relations On 21 May 2014 China and Russia

a significant trade surplus with the United States its most important export market 213 In the early 2010s US politicians argued that the Chinese yuan was significantly undervalued giving China an

Peoples Republic of China and CrossStrait relations Map depicting territorial disputes between the PRC and neighbouring states For a larger map see here Ever since its establishment after the second Chinese Civil War the PRC has claimed the territories governed by the Republic of China ROC a separate political entity today commonly known as Taiwan as a part of its territory It regards the island of Taiwan as its Taiwan Province Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province and Guangdong Province These claims are controversial because of the complicated CrossStrait relations with the PRC treating the OneChina policy as one of its most important diplomatic principles 224 In addition to Taiwan China is also involved in other international territorial disputes Since the 1990s China has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders including a disputed border with India and an undefined border with Bhutan China is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the East and South China Seas such as the Senkaku Islands and the Scarborough Shoal 225 226 On 21 May 2014 Xi Jinping speaking at a conference in Shanghai pledged to settle Chinas territorial disputes peacefully China stays committed to seeking peaceful settlement of disputes with other countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests he said 227 Emerging superpower status China is regularly hailed as a potential new superpower 228 229 with certain commentators citing its rapid economic progress growing military might very large population and increasing international influence as signs that it will play a prominent global role in the 21st century 230 231 Others however warn that economic bubbles and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt Chinas growth as the century progresses 232 233 Some authors also question the definition of superpower arguing that Chinas large economy alone would not qualify it as a superpower and noting that it lacks the military power and cultural influence of the United States 234 Others namely IRENA have argued that Chinas investment in renewable energy has positioned it to be a likely superpower in that area especially due to a shift in global trade relations 235 Sociopolitical

Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo who died of organ failure while in government custody in 2017 The Chinese democracy movement social activists and some members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need for social and political reform While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s political freedom is still tightly restricted The Constitution of the Peoples Republic of China states that the fundamental rights of citizens include freedom of speech freedom of the press the right to a fair trial freedom of religion universal suffrage and property rights However in practice these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state 236 237 Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling Communist Party are tolerated censorship of political speech and information most notably on the Internet 238 239 are routinely used to prevent collective action 240 By 2020 China plans to give all its citizens a personal Social Credit score based on how they behave 241 The Social Credit System now being piloted in a number of Chinese cities is considered a form of mass surveillance which uses big data analysis technology 242 243 In 2005 Reporters Without Borders ranked China 159th out of 167 states in its Annual World Press Freedom Index which indicates a very low level of press freedom 244 In 2014 China ranked 175th out of 180 countries 245 Rural migrants to Chinas cities often find themselves treated as second class citizens by the hukou household registration system which controls access to state benefits 246 247 Property rights are often poorly protected 246 However a number of rural taxes have been reduced or abolished since the early 2000s and additional social services provided to rural dwellers 248 249 A number of foreign governments foreign press agencies and NGOs also routinely criticize Chinas human rights record alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial forced abortions 250 forced confessions torture restrictions of fundamental rights 182 251 and excessive use of the death penalty 252 253 The government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to social stability as was the case with the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 Candlelight vigil on the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests Falun Gong was first taught publicly in 1992 In 1999 when there were about 70 million practitioners 254 the persecution of Falun Gong began resulting in mass arrests extralegal detention and alleged reports of torture and deaths in custody 255 256 The Chinese state is regularly accused of largescale repression and human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang including violent police crackdowns and religious suppression 257 258 At least one million members of Chinas Muslim Uyghur minority have been detained in mass detention camps termed reeducation camps aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees their identities and their religious beliefs 259 The camps were established under General Secretary Xi Jinping s administration 260 In January 2019 the United Nations asked for direct access to the detention camps after a panel said it had received credible reports that 11 million Uygur Kazakhs Hui and other ethnic minorities had been detained in reeducation camps 261 The state has even sought to control offshore reporting of tensions in Xinjiang intimidating foreignbased reporters by detaining their family members 262 The Chinese government has responded to foreign criticism by arguing that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a countrys present level of economic development 263 It emphasizes the rise in the Chinese standard of living literacy rate and average life expectancy since the 1970s as well as improvements in workplace safety and efforts to combat natural disasters such as the perennial Yangtze River floods 263 264 265 Furthermore some Chinese politicians have spoken out in support of democratization although others remain more conservative 266 Some major reform efforts have been conducted For instance in November 2013 the government announced plans to relax the onechild policy and abolish the muchcriticized reeducation through labour program 128 although human rights groups note that reforms to the latter have been largely cosmetic 255 During the 2000s and early 2010s the Chinese government was increasingly tolerant of NGOs that offer practical efficient solutions to social problems but such third sector activity remained heavily regulated 267 After Xi Jinping succeeded General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012 human rights in China have become worse 268 2019 Hong Kong protests The Global Slavery Index estimated that in 2016 more than 38 million people were living in conditions of modern slavery or 025 of the population including victims of human trafficking forced labor forced marriage child labor and stateimposed forced labor All except the last category are illegal The stateimposed forced system was formally abolished in 2013 but it is not clear the extent to which its various practices have stopped 269 The Chinese penal system includes labor prison factories detention centers and reeducation camps which fall under the heading Laogai reform through labor The Laogai Research Foundation in the United States estimated that there were over a thousand slave labour prisons and camps known collectively as the Laogai 270 Prisoners are not paid at all and need their families to send money to them Prisoners who refuse to work are beaten and some are beaten to death Many of the prisoners are political or religious dissidents and some are recognized internationally as prisoners of conscience A Chinese leader said that they want to see two products coming out of the prisons the man who has been reformed and the product made by the man Harry Wu himself a former prisoner of the Laogai filmed undercover footage of the Laogai and was charged with stealing state secrets For this Harry Wu was sentenced to 15 years in prison but only served 66 days before being deported to the United States 271 272 273 In 2019 a worldfirst study called for the mass retraction of more than 400 scientific papers on organ transplantation because of fears the organs were obtained unethically from Chinese prisoners The study was published in the medical journal BMJ Open A report published in 2016 found a large discrepancy between official transplant figures from the Chinese government and the number of transplants reported by hospitals While the government says 10000 transplants occur each year hospital data shows between 60000 and 100000 organs are transplanted each year The report provided evidence that this gap is being made up by executed prisoners of conscience 274 Military Main articles Military history of China before 1911 and Peoples Liberation Army Chinese Russian and Mongolian national flags set

death in 1976 and the consequent end of the Cultural Revolution Deng Xiaoping and the new Chinese leadership began to reform the economy and move towards a more marketoriented mixed economy under oneparty rule Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized while foreign trade became a major new focus leading to the creation of Special Economic Zones SEZs Inefficient stateowned enterprises SOEs were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright resulting in massive job losses Modernday China is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership 339 and is one of the leading examples of state capitalism 340 341 The state still dominates in strategic pillar sectors such as energy production and heavy industries but private enterprise has expanded enormously with around 30million private businesses recorded in 2008 342 343 344 345 In 2018 private enterprises in China accounted for 60 of GDP 80 of urban employment

76 of growth in Chinas GDP came from consumption 353 According to the IMF Chinas annual average GDP growth between 2001 and 2010 was 105 In the years immediately following the financial crisis of 2007 Chinas economic growth rate was equivalent to all of the G7 countries growth combined 354 According to the Global Growth Generators index announced by Citigroup in February 2011 China has a very high 3G growth rating 355 Its high productivity low labor costs and relatively good infrastructure have made it a global leader in manufacturing China ranks 1 in the production of steel aluminum and automobilesChinas global market shares are 50 in steel 356 50 in aluminum 357 and 30 in automobile manufacturing 358 China has also been increasingly turning to automation becoming the worlds largest

has become 1 in the world in terms of installed solar power capacity hydropower and wind power According to the World Economic Forum China will account for 40 of the global renewable energy by 2022 366 In addition official GDP figures are seen as unreliable and there have been several wellpublicized cases of data manipulation 367 368 369 In the early 2010s Chinas economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic credit troubles weakening international demand for Chinese exports and fragility in the global economy 370 371 372 Chinas GDP was smaller than Germanys in 2007 however by 2017

followed with bilateral agreements to settle trades directly in renminbi with Russia 433 Japan 434 Australia 435 Singapore 436 the United Kingdom 437 and Canada 438 As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi it became the eighthmosttraded currency in the world an emerging international reserve currency 439 and a component of the IMFs special drawing rights however

both auto sales and production Sales of passenger cars in 2016 exceeded 24million 537 A sideeffect of the rapid growth of Chinas road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents 538 with poorly enforced traffic laws cited as a possible causein 2011 alone around 62000 Chinese died in road accidents 539 However the Chinese government has taken a lot of steps to address this problem and has reduced the number of fatalities in traffic accidents by 20 from 2007 to 2017 540 In urban areas bicycles remain a common mode of transport despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles as of

Demographics of China A 2009 population density map of the Peoples Republic of China and Taiwan The eastern coastal provinces are much more densely populated than the western interior The national census of 2010 recorded the population of the Peoples Republic of China as approximately 1370536875 About 1660 of the population were 14 years old or younger 7014 were between 15 and 59 years old and 1326 were over 60 years old 563 The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 046 564 China used to make up much of the worlds poor now it makes up much of the worlds middle class 565 Although a middleincome country by Western standards Chinas rapid growth has pulled hundreds of millions 800 million to be more precise 566 of its people out of poverty since 1978 By 2013 less than 2 of the Chinese population lived below the international poverty line of US19 per day down from 88 in 1981 330 Chinas own standards for poverty are higher and still the country is on its way to eradicate national poverty completely by 2019 567 From 20092018 the unemployment rate in China has averaged about 4 568 Given concerns about population growth China implemented a twochild limit during the 1970s and in 1979 began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family Beginning in the mid 1980s however given the unpopularity of the strict limits China began to allow some major exemptions particularly in rural areas resulting in what was actually a 15child policy from the mid1980s to 2015 ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013 allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child 569 In 2016 the onechild policy was replaced in favor of a twochild policy 570 Data from the 2010 census implies that the total fertility rate may be around 14 although due to underreporting of births it may be closer to 1516 571 According to one group of scholars onechild limits had little effect on population growth 572 or the size of the total population 573 However these scholars have been challenged Their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that China averted more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015 a number which may reach one billion by 2060 given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions with onechild restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reduction 574 The policy along with traditional preference for boys may have contributed to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth 575 576 According to the 2010 census the sex ratio at birth was 11806 boys for every 100 girls 577 which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls 578 The 2010 census
