the linguistic and philosophical study of meaning in language programming languages formal logics and semiotics It is concerned with the relationship between signifiers like words phrases signs and symbols and what they stand for in reality their denotation In International scientific vocabulary semantics is also called semasiology The word semantics was first used by Michel Bréal a French philologist 2 It denotes a range of ideasfrom the popular to the highly technical It is often used in ordinary language for denoting a problem of understanding that comes down to word selection or connotation This problem of understanding has been the subject of many formal enquiries over a long period of time especially in the field of formal semantics In linguistics it is the study of the interpretation of signs or symbols used in agents or communities within particular circumstances and contexts 3 Within this view sounds facial expressions body language and proxemics have semantic meaningful content and each comprises several branches of study In written language things like paragraph structure and punctuation bear semantic content other forms of language bear other semantic content 3 The formal study of semantics intersects with many other fields of inquiry including lexicology syntax pragmatics etymology and others Independently semantics is also a welldefined field in its own right often with synthetic properties 4 In the philosophy of language semantics and reference are closely connected Further related fields include philology communication and semiotics The formal study of semantics can therefore be manifold and complex Semantics contrasts with syntax the study of the combinatorics of units of a language without reference to their meaning and pragmatics the study of the relationships between the symbols of a language their meaning and the users of the language 5 Semantics as a field of study also has significant ties to various representational theories of meaning including truth theories of meaning coherence theories of meaning and correspondence theories of meaning Each of these is related to the general philosophical study of reality and the representation of meaning In 1960s psychosemantic studies became popular after Osgood s massive crosscultural studies using his semantic differential SD method that used thousands of nouns and adjective bipolar scales A specific form of the SD Projective Semantics method 6 uses only most common and neutral nouns that correspond to the 7 groups factors of adjectivescales most consistently found in crosscultural studies Evaluation Potency Activity as found by Osgood and Reality Organization Complexity Limitation as found in other studies In this method seven groups of bipolar adjective scales corresponded to seven types of nouns so the method was thought to have the objectscale symmetry OSS between the scales and nouns for evaluation using these scales For example the nouns corresponding to the listed 7 factors would be Beauty Power Motion Life Work Chaos Law Beauty was expected to be assessed unequivocally as very good on adjectives of Evaluationrelated scales Life as very real on Realityrelated scales etc However deviations in this symmetric and very basic matrix might show underlying biases of two types scalesrelated bias and objectsrelated bias This OSS design meant to increase the sensitivity of the SD method to any semantic biases in responses of people within the same culture and educational background 7 8 Contents 1 Linguistics 2 Montague grammar 3

Notes 9 References 10 External links Linguistics edit In linguistics semantics is the subfield that is devoted to the study of meaning as inherent at the levels of words phrases sentences and larger units of discourse termed texts or narratives The study of semantics is also closely linked to the subjects of representation reference and denotation The basic study of semantics is oriented to the examination of the meaning of signs and the study of relations between different linguistic units and compounds homonymy synonymy antonymy hypernymy hyponymy meronymy metonymy holonymy paronyms A key concern is how meaning attaches to larger chunks of text possibly as a result of the composition from smaller units of meaning Traditionally semantics has included the study of sense and denotative reference truth conditions argument structure thematic roles discourse analysis and the linkage of all of these to syntax Montague grammar edit In the late 1960s Richard Montague proposed a system for defining semantic entries in the lexicon in terms of the lambda calculus In these terms the syntactic parse of the sentence John ate every bagel would consist of a subject John and a predicate ate every bagel Montague demonstrated that the meaning of the sentence altogether could be decomposed into the meanings of its parts and in relatively few rules of combination The logical predicate thus obtained would be elaborated further eg using truth theory models which ultimately relate meanings to a set of Tarskian universals which may lie outside the logic The notion of such meaning atoms or primitives is basic to the language of thought hypothesis from the 1970s Despite its elegance Montague grammar was limited by the contextdependent variability in word sense and led to several attempts at incorporating context such as Situation semantics 1980s truthvalues are incomplete they get assigned based on context Generative lexicon 1990s categories types are incomplete and get assigned based on context Prototype theory edit Another set of concepts related to fuzziness in semantics is based on prototypes The work of Eleanor Rosch in the 1970s led to a view that natural categories are not characterizable in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions but are graded fuzzy at their boundaries and inconsistent as to the status of their constituent members One may compare it with Jung s archetype though the concept of archetype sticks to static concept Some poststructuralists are against the fixed or static meaning of the words Derrida following Nietzsche talked about slippages in fixed meanings Systems of categories are not objectively out there in the world but are rooted in peoples experience These categories evolve as learned concepts of the world meaning is not an objective truth but a subjective construct learned from experience and language arises out of the grounding of our conceptual systems in shared embodiment and bodily experience 9 A corollary of this is that the conceptual categories ie the lexicon will not be identical for different cultures or indeed for every individual in the same culture This leads to another debate see the SapirWhorf hypothesis or Eskimo words for snow Theories in semantics edit Formal semantics edit Main article Formal semantics linguistics Originates from Montagues work see above A highly formalized theory of natural language semantics in which expressions are assigned denotations meanings such as individuals truth values or functions from one of these to another The truth of a sentence and its logical relation to other sentences is then evaluated relative to a model Truthconditional semantics edit Main article Truthconditional semantics Pioneered by the philosopher Donald Davidson another formalized theory which aims to associate each natural language sentence with a metalanguage description of the conditions under which it is true for example Snow is white is true if and only if snow is white The challenge is to arrive at the truth conditions for any sentences from fixed meanings assigned to the individual words and fixed rules for how to combine them In practice truthconditional semantics is similar to modeltheoretic semantics conceptually however they differ in that truthconditional semantics seeks to connect language with statements about the real world in the form of metalanguage statements rather than with abstract models Conceptual semantics edit Main article Conceptual semantics This theory is an effort to explain properties of argument structure The assumption behind this theory is that syntactic properties of phrases reflect the meanings of the words that head them 10 With this theory linguists can better deal with the fact that subtle differences in word meaning correlate with other differences in the syntactic structure that the word appears in 10 The way this is gone about is by looking at the internal structure of words 11 These small parts that make up the internal structure of words are termed semantic primitives 11 Cognitive semantics edit Main article Cognitive semantics Cognitive semantics approaches meaning from the perspective of cognitive linguistics In this framework language is explained via general human cognitive abilities rather than a domainspecific language module The techniques native to cognitive semantics are typically used in lexical studies such as those put forth by Leonard Talmy George Lakoff Dirk Geeraerts and Bruce Wayne Hawkins Some cognitive semantic frameworks such as that developed by Talmy take into account syntactic structures as well Semantics through modern researchers can be linked to the Wernickes area of the brain and can be measured using the eventrelated potential ERP ERP is the rapid electrical response recorded with small disc electrodes which are placed on a persons scalp 12 Lexical semantics edit Main article Lexical semantics A linguistic theory that investigates word meaning This theory understands that the meaning of a word is fully reflected by its context Here the meaning of a word is constituted by its contextual relations 13 Therefore a distinction between degrees of participation as well as modes of participation are made 13 In order to accomplish this distinction any part of a sentence that bears a meaning and combines with the meanings of other constituents is labeled as a semantic constituent Semantic constituents that cannot be broken down into more elementary constituents are labeled minimal semantic constituents 13 Crosscultural semantics edit Various fields or disciplines have long been contributing to crosscultural semantics Are words like love truth and hate universals 14 Is even the word sense so central to semantics a universal or a concept entrenched in a longstanding but culturespecific tradition 15 These are the kind of crucial questions that are discussed in crosscultural semantics Translation theory ethnolinguistics linguistic anthropology and cultural linguistics specialize in the field of comparing contrasting and translating words terms and meanings from one language to another see Herder W von Humboldt Boas Sapir and Whorf But philosophy sociology and anthropology have long established traditions in contrasting the different nuances of the terms and concepts we use And online encyclopaedias such as the Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy httpsplatostanfordedu and more and more Wikipedia itself have greatly facilitated the possibilities of comparing the background and usages of key cultural terms In recent years the question of whether key terms are translatable or untranslatable has increasingly come to the fore of global discussions especially since the publication of Barbara Cassins Dictionary of Untranslatables A Philosophical Lexicon in 2014 16 17 Computational semantics edit Main article Computational semantics Computational semantics is focused on the processing of linguistic meaning In order to do this concrete algorithms and architectures are described Within this framework the algorithms and architectures are also analyzed in terms of decidability timespace complexity data structures that they require and communication protocols 18 Computer science edit Main article Semantics computer science In computer science the term semantics refers to the meaning of language constructs as opposed to their form syntax According to Euzenat semantics provides the rules for interpreting the syntax which do not provide the meaning directly but constrains the possible interpretations of what is declared 19 Programming languages edit The semantics of programming languages and other languages is an important issue and area of study in computer science Like the syntax of a language its semantics can be defined exactly For instance the following statements use different syntaxes but cause the same instructions to be executed namely perform an arithmetical addition of y to x and store the result in a variable called x Statement Programming languages x y C C C Java JavaScript Python Ruby etc x y Perl PHP x x y Ada ALGOL ALGOL 68 BCPL Dylan

def PostScript y x Forth x x y J Various ways have been developed to describe the semantics of programming languages formally building on mathematical logic 20 Operational semantics The meaning of a construct is specified by the computation it induces when it is executed on a machine In particular it is of interest how the effect of a computation is produced Denotational semantics Meanings are modelled by mathematical objects that represent the effect of executing the constructs Thus only the effect is of interest not how it is obtained Axiomatic semantics Specific properties of the effect of executing the constructs are expressed as assertions Thus there may be aspects of the executions that are ignored Semantic models edit The Semantic Web refers to the extension of the World Wide Web via embedding added semantic metadata using semantic data modeling techniques such as Resource Description Framework RDF and Web Ontology Language OWLOn the Semantic Web terms such as semantic network and semantic data model are used to describe particular types of data model characterized by the use of directed graphs in which the vertices denote concepts or entities in the world and their properties and the arcs denote relationships between them These can formally be described as description logic concepts and roles which correspond to OWL classes and properties 21 Psychology edit In psychology semantic memory is memory for meaning in other words the aspect of memory that preserves only the gist the general significance of remembered experience while episodic memory is memory for the ephemeral details the individual features or the unique particulars of experience The term episodic memory was introduced by Tulving and Schacter in the context of declarative memory which involved simple association of factual or objective information concerning its object Word meaning is measured by the company they keep ie the relationships among words themselves in a semantic network The memories may be transferred intergenerationally or isolated in one generation due to a cultural disruption Different generations may have different experiences at similar points in their own timelines This may then create a vertically heterogeneous semantic net for certain words in an otherwise homogeneous culture 22 In a network created by people analyzing their understanding of the word such as Wordnet the links and decomposition structures of the network are few in number and kind and include part of kind of and similar links In automated ontologies the links are computed vectors without explicit meaning Various automated technologies are being developed to compute the meaning of words latent semantic indexing and support vector machines as well as natural language processing artificial neural networks and predicate calculus techniques Ideasthesia is a psychological phenomenon in which activation of concepts evokes sensory experiences For example in synesthesia activation of a concept of a letter eg that of the letter A evokes sensorylike experiences eg of red color See also edit Linguistics portal Linguistics and semiotics edit Asemic writing Cognitive
