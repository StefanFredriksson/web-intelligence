6 Type Integrated development environment License Freemium 7 Website visualstudio microsoft com Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment IDE from Microsoft It is used to develop computer programs as well as websites web apps web services and mobile apps Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API Windows Forms Windows Presentation Foundation Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight It can produce both native code and managed code Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense the code completion component as well as code refactoring The integrated debugger works both as a sourcelevel debugger and a machinelevel debugger Other builtin tools include a code profiler designer for building GUI applications web designer class designer and database schema designer It accepts plugins that enhance the functionality at almost every levelincluding adding support for source control systems like Subversion and Git and adding new toolsets like editors and visual designers for domainspecific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software development lifecycle like the Azure DevOps client Team Explorer Visual Studio supports 36 different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support to varying degrees nearly any programming language provided a languagespecific service exists Builtin languages include C 8 C CCLI Visual Basic NET C F 9 JavaScript TypeScript XML XSLT HTML and CSS Support for other languages such as Python 10 Ruby Nodejs and M among others is available via plugins Java and J were supported in the past The most basic edition of Visual Studio the Community edition is available free of charge The slogan for Visual Studio Community edition is Free

not support any programming language solution or tool intrinsically instead it allows the plugging of functionality coded as a VSPackage When installed the functionality is available as a Service The IDE provides three services SVsSolution which provides the ability to enumerate projects and solutions SVsUIShell which provides windowing and UI functionality including tabs toolbars and tool windows and SVsShell which deals with registration of VSPackages In addition the IDE is also responsible for coordinating and enabling communication between services 11 All editors designers project types and other tools are implemented as VSPackages Visual Studio uses COM to access the VSPackages The Visual Studio SDK also includes the Managed Package Framework MPF which is a set of managed wrappers around the COMinterfaces that allow the Packages to be written in any CLI compliant language 12 However MPF does not provide all the functionality exposed by the Visual Studio COM interfaces 13 The services can then be consumed for creation of other packages which add functionality to the Visual Studio IDE Support for programming languages is added by using a specific VSPackage called a Language Service A language service defines various interfaces which the VSPackage implementation can implement to add support for various functionalities 14 Functionalities that can be added this way include syntax coloring statement completion brace matching parameter information tooltips member lists and error markers for background compilation 14 If the interface is implemented the functionality will be available for the language Language services are implemented on a perlanguage basis The implementations can reuse code from the parser or the compiler for the language 14 Language services can be implemented either in native code or managed code For native code either the native COM interfaces or the Babel Framework part of Visual Studio SDK can be used 15 For managed code the MPF includes wrappers for writing managed language services 16 Visual Studio does not include any source control support built in but it defines two alternative ways for source control systems to integrate with the IDE 17 A Source Control VSPackage can provide its own customised user interface In contrast a source control plugin using the MSSCCI Microsoft Source Code Control Interface provides a set of functions that are used to implement various source control functionality with a standard Visual Studio user interface 18 19 MSSCCI was first used to integrate Visual SourceSafe with Visual Studio 60 but was later opened up via the Visual Studio SDK Visual Studio NET 2002 used MSSCCI 11 and Visual Studio NET 2003 used MSSCCI 12 Visual Studio 2005 2008 and 2010 use MSSCCI Version 13 which adds support for rename and delete propagation as well as asynchronous opening 19 Visual Studio supports running multiple instances of the environment each with its own set of VSPackages The instances use different registry hives see MSDN s definition of the term registry hive in the sense used here to store their configuration state and are differentiated by their AppId Application ID The instances are launched by an AppIdspecific exe that selects the AppId sets the root hive and launches the IDE VSPackages registered for one AppId are integrated with other VSPackages for that AppId The various product editions of Visual Studio are created using the different AppIds The Visual Studio Express edition products are installed with their own AppIds but the Standard Professional and Team Suite products share the same AppId Consequently one can install the Express editions sidebyside with other editions unlike the other editions which update the same installation The professional edition includes a superset of the VSPackages in the standard edition and the team suite includes a superset of the VSPackages in both other editions The AppId system is leveraged by the Visual Studio Shell in Visual Studio 2008 20 Features edit Code editor edit Like any other IDE it includes a code editor that supports syntax highlighting and code completion using IntelliSense for variables functions methods loops and LINQ queries 21 IntelliSense is supported for the included languages as well as for XML Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript when developing web sites and web applications 22 23 Autocomplete suggestions appear in a modeless list box over the code editor window in proximity of the editing cursor In Visual Studio 2008 onwards it can be made temporarily semitransparent to see the code obstructed by it 21 The code editor is used for all supported languages The Visual Studio code editor also supports setting bookmarks in code for quick navigation Other navigational aids include collapsing code blocks and incremental search in addition to normal text search and regex search 24 The code editor also includes a multiitem clipboard and a task list 24 The code editor supports code snippets which are saved templates for repetitive code and can be inserted into code and customized for the project being worked on A management tool for code snippets is built in as well These tools are surfaced as floating windows which can be set to automatically hide when unused or docked to the side of the screen The Visual Studio code editor also supports code refactoring including parameter reordering variable and method renaming interface extraction and encapsulation of class members inside properties among others Visual Studio features background compilation also called incremental compilation 25 26 As code is being written Visual Studio compiles it in the background in order to provide feedback about syntax and compilation errors which are flagged with a red wavy underline Warnings are marked with a green underline Background compilation does not generate executable code since it requires a different compiler than the one used to generate executable code 27 Background compilation was initially introduced with Microsoft Visual Basic but has now been expanded for all included languages 26 Debugger edit Main article Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger Visual Studio includes a debugger that works both as a sourcelevel debugger and as a machinelevel debugger It works with both managed code as well as native code and can be used for debugging applications written in any language supported by Visual Studio In addition it can also attach to running processes monitor and debug those processes 28 If source code for the running process is available it displays the code as it is being run If source code is not available it can show the disassembly The Visual Studio debugger can also create memory dumps as well as load them later for debugging 29 Multithreaded programs are also supported The debugger can be configured to be launched when an application running outside the Visual Studio environment crashes The debugger allows setting breakpoints which allow execution to be stopped temporarily at a certain position and watches which monitor the values of variables as the execution progresses 30 Breakpoints can be conditional meaning they get triggered when the condition is met Code can be stepped over ie run one line of source code at a time 31 It can either step into functions to debug inside it or step over it ie the execution of the function body isnt available for manual inspection 31 The debugger supports Edit and Continue ie it allows code to be edited as it is being debugged When debugging if the mouse pointer hovers over any variable its current value is displayed in a tooltip data tooltips where it can also be modified if desired During coding the Visual Studio debugger lets certain functions be invoked manually from the Immediate tool window The parameters to the method are supplied at the Immediate window 32 Designer edit Visual Studio includes a host of visual designers to aid in the development of applications These tools include Windows Forms Designer The Windows Forms designer is used to build GUI applications using Windows Forms Layout can be controlled by housing the controls inside other containers or locking them to the side of the form Controls that display data like textbox list box and grid view can be bound to data sources like databases or queries Databound controls can be created by dragging items from the Data Sources window onto a design surface 33 The UI is linked with code using an eventdriven programming model The designer generates either C or VBNET code for the application WPF Designer The WPF designer codenamed Cider 34 was introduced with Visual Studio 2008 Like the Windows Forms designer it supports the drag and drop metaphor It is used to author user interfaces targeting Windows Presentation Foundation It supports all WPF functionality including data binding and automatic layout management It generates XAML code for the UI The generated XAML file is compatible with Microsoft Expression Design the designeroriented product The XAML code is linked with code using a codebehind model Web designerdevelopment Visual Studio also includes a website editor and designer that allows web pages to be authored by dragging and dropping widgets It is used for developing ASPNET applications and supports HTML CSS and JavaScript It uses a codebehind model to link with ASPNET code From Visual Studio 2008 onwards the layout engine used by the web designer is shared with Microsoft Expression Web There is also ASPNET MVC support for MVC technology as a separate download 35 and ASPNET Dynamic Data project available from Microsoft 36 Class designer The Class Designer is used to author and edit the classes including its members and their access using UML modeling The Class Designer can generate C and VBNET code outlines for the classes and methods It can also generate class diagrams from handwritten classes Data designer The data designer can be used to graphically edit database schemas including typed tables primary and foreign keys and constraints It can also be used to design queries from the graphical view Mapping designer From Visual Studio 2008 onwards the mapping designer is used by LINQ to SQL to design the mapping between database schemas and the classes that encapsulate the data The new solution from ORM approach ADONET Entity Framework replaces and improves the old technology Other tools edit Open Tabs Browser The open tabs browser is used to list all open tabs and to switch between them It is invoked using CTRLTAB Properties Editor The Properties Editor tool is used to edit properties in a GUI pane inside Visual Studio It lists all available properties both readonly and those which can be set for all objects including classes forms web pages and other items Object Browser The Object Browser is a namespace and class library browser for Microsoft NET It can be used to browse the namespaces which are arranged hierarchically in managed assemblies The hierarchy may or may not reflect the organization in the file system Solution Explorer In Visual Studio parlance a solution is a set of code files and other resources that are used to build an application The files in a solution are arranged hierarchically which might or might not reflect the organization in the file system The Solution Explorer is used to manage and browse the files in a solution Team Explorer Team Explorer is used to integrate the capabilities of Azure DevOps either Azure DevOps Services or Azure DevOps Server into the IDE In addition to version control integration it provides the ability to view and manage individual work items including user stories bugs tasks and other documents It is included as part of a Visual Studio installation and is also available as a standalone download 37 38 Data Explorer Data Explorer is used to manage databases on Microsoft SQL Server instances It allows creation and alteration of database tables either by issuing TSQL commands or by using the Data designer It can also be used to create queries and stored procedures with the latter in either TSQL or in managed code via SQL CLR Debugging and IntelliSense support is available as well Server Explorer The Server Explorer tool is used to manage database connections on an accessible computer It is also used to browse running Windows Services performance counters Windows Event Log and message queues and use them as a datasource 39 PreEmptive ProtectionDotfuscator Community Edition Visual Studio includes a free light version of Dotfuscator by PreEmptive Solutions which obfuscates and hardens applications to help secure trade secrets IP reduce piracycounterfeiting protect against tampering and unauthorized debugging Dotfuscator works with all flavors of NET including ASPNET Xamarin Unity and UWP 40 Text Generation Framework Visual Studio includes a full text generation framework called T4 which enables Visual Studio to generate text files from templates either in the IDE or via code ASPNET Web Site Administration Tool The ASPNET Web Site Administration Tool allows for the configuration of ASPNET websites Visual Studio Tools for Office Visual Studio Tools for Office is a SDK and an addin for Visual Studio that includes tools for developing for the Microsoft Office suite Previously for Visual Studio NET 2003 and Visual Studio 2005 it was a separate SKU that supported only Visual C and Visual Basic languages or was included in the Team Suite With Visual Studio 2008 it is no longer a separate SKU but is included with Professional and higher editions A separate runtime is required when deploying VSTO solutions Extensibility edit See also List of Microsoft Visual Studio addins and Visual Studio Extensibility Visual Studio allows developers to write extensions for Visual Studio to extend its capabilities These extensions plug into Visual Studio and extend its functionality Extensions come in the form of macros addins and packages Macros represent repeatable tasks and actions that developers can record programmatically for saving replaying and distributing Macros however cannot implement new commands or create tool windows They are written using Visual Basic and are not compiled 13 AddIns provide access to the Visual Studio object model and can interact with the IDE tools AddIns can be used to implement new functionality and can add new tool windows AddIns are plugged into the IDE via COM and can be created in any COMcompliant languages 13 Packages are created using the Visual Studio SDK and provide the highest level of extensibility They can create designers and other tools as well as integrate other programming languages The Visual Studio SDK provides unmanaged APIs as well as a managed API to accomplish these tasks However the managed API isnt as comprehensive as the unmanaged one 13 Extensions are supported in the Standard and higher versions of Visual Studio 2005 Express Editions do not support hosting extensions Visual Studio 2008 introduced the Visual Studio Shell that allows for development of a customized version of the IDE The Visual Studio Shell defines a set of VSPackages that provide the functionality required in any IDE On top of that other packages can be added to customize the installation The Isolated mode of the shell creates a new AppId where the packages are installed These are to be started with a different executable It is aimed for development of custom development environments either for a specific language or a specific scenario The Integrated mode installs the packages into the AppId of the ProfessionalStandardTeam System editions so that the tools integrate into these editions 20 The Visual Studio Shell is available as a free download After the release of Visual Studio 2008 Microsoft created the Visual Studio Gallery It serves as the central location for posting information about extensions to Visual Studio Community developers as well as commercial developers can upload information about their extensions to Visual Studio NET 2002 through Visual Studio 2010 Users of the site can rate and review the extensions to help assess the quality of extensions being posted An extension is stored in a VSIX file Internally a VSIX file is a ZIP file that contains some XML files and possibly one or more DLLs One of the main advantages of these extensions is that they do not require Administrator rights to be installed RSS feeds to notify users on updates to the site and tagging features are also planned 41 Supported products edit Microsoft Visual C Microsoft Visual C is Microsofts partial implementation of the C and full implementation C compiler and associated languagesservices and specific tools for integration with the Visual Studio IDE It can compile either in C mode or C mode For C as of version 157 it conforms to C17 42 The C implementation of Visual Studio 2015 still doesnt support the full standard in particular the complex number header complexh introduced in C99 is unsupported Visual C supports the CCLI specification to write managed code as well as mixedmode code a mix of native and managed code Microsoft positions Visual C for development in native code or in code that contains both native as well as managed components Visual C supports COM as well as the MFC library For MFC development it provides a set of wizards for creating and customizing MFC boilerplate code and creating GUI applications using MFC Visual C can also use the Visual Studio forms designer to design UI graphically Visual C can also be used with the Windows API It also supports the use of intrinsic functions 43 which are functions recognized by the compiler itself and not implemented as a library Intrinsic functions are used to expose the SSE instruction set of modern CPUs Visual C also includes the OpenMP version 20 specification 44 Microsoft Visual C Microsoft Visual C Microsofts implementation of the C language targets the NET Framework along with the language services that lets the Visual Studio IDE support C projects While the language services are a part of Visual Studio the compiler is available separately as a part of the NET Framework The Visual C 2008 2010 and 2012 compilers support versions 30 40 and 50 of the C language specifications respectively Visual C supports the Visual Studio Class designer Forms designer and Data designer among others 45 Microsoft Visual Basic Microsoft Visual Basic is Microsofts implementation of the VBNET language and associated tools and language services It was introduced with Visual Studio NET 2002 Microsoft has positioned Visual Basic for Rapid Application Development 46 47 Visual Basic can be used to author both console applications as well as GUI applications Like Visual C Visual Basic also supports the Visual Studio Class designer Forms designer and Data designer among others Like C the VBNET compiler is also available as a part of NET Framework but the language services that let VBNET projects be developed with Visual Studio are available as a part of the latter Microsoft Visual Web Developer Microsoft Visual Web Developer is used to create web sites web applications and web services using ASPNET Either C or VBNET languages can be used Visual Web Developer can use the Visual Studio Web Designer to graphically design web page layouts Azure DevOps Azure DevOps is intended for collaborative software development projects and provides version control work planning and tracking data collection and reporting It also includes the Team Explorer which is integrated inside Visual Studio On 10 September 2018 Microsoft announced a rebranding of Visual Studio Team Services VSTS to Azure DevOps Services and Team Foundation Server TFS to Azure DevOps Server 48 Previous products edit Visual FoxPro Visual FoxPro is a datacentric objectoriented and procedural programming language produced by Microsoft It derives from FoxPro originally known as FoxBASE which was developed by Fox Software beginning in 1984 Visual FoxPro is tightly integrated with its own relational database engine which extends FoxPros xBase capabilities to support SQL queries and data manipulation Visual FoxPro is a fullfeatured 49 dynamic programming language that does not require the use of an additional generalpurpose programming environment In 2007 Visual FoxPro was discontinued after version 9 Service Pack 2 It was supported until 2015 50 Visual SourceSafe Microsoft Visual SourceSafe is a source control software package oriented towards small softwaredevelopment projects The SourceSafe database is a multiuser multiprocess filesystem database using the Windows file system database primitives to provide locking and sharing support All versions are multiuser using SMB file server networking 51 52 53 However with Visual SourceSafe 2005 other clientserver modes were added Lan Booster and VSS Internet which used HTTP HTTPS Visual SourceSafe 60 was available as a standalone product 54 and was included with Visual Studio 60 and other products such as Office Developer Edition Visual SourceSafe 2005 was available as a standalone product and included with the 2005 Team Suite Azure DevOps has superseded VSS as Microsofts recommended platform for source control Microsoft Visual J Microsoft Visual J Microsoft Visual J was Microsoft s implementation of the Java language with Microsoftspecific extensions and associated language services It was discontinued as a result of litigation from Sun Microsystems and the technology was recycled into Visual J Microsofts Java compiler for NET Framework J was available with Visual Studio 2005 supported until 2015 but was discontinued in Visual Studio 2008 Visual InterDev Visual InterDev was used to create web applications using Microsoft Active Server Pages ASP technologies It supports code completion and includes database server management tools It has been replaced with Microsoft Visual Web Developer Editions edit Microsoft Visual Studio is available in the following editions or SKUs 55 Community edit The Community edition was announced on 12 November 2014 as a new free version with similar functionality to Visual Studio Professional Prior to this date the only free editions of Visual Studio were the featurelimited Express variants Unlike the Express variants Visual Studio Community supports multiple languages and provides support for extensions Individual developers have no restrictions on their use of the Community edition The following uses also allow unlimited usage contributing to Open Source projects academic research in a classroom learning environment and for developing and testing device drivers for the Windows operating system All other use by an organization depends on whether you are classified as an Enterprise more than 250 employees 1 Million in revenue per Microsoft NonEnterprises may use up to 5 copies without restriction user number 6 and higher require a commercial license Enterprise organizations require a commercial license for use outside of the noted exceptions 56 57 Visual Studio Community is oriented towards individual developers and small teams 58 59 Professional edit As of Visual Studio 2010 the Professional edition is the entry level commercial edition of Visual Studio Previously a more feature restricted Standard edition was available 60 It provides an IDE for all supported development languages MSDN support is available as MSDN Essentials or the full MSDN library depending on licensing It supports XML and XSLT editing and can create deployment packages that only use ClickOnce and MSI It includes tools like Server Explorer and integration with Microsoft SQL Server also Windows Mobile development support was included in Visual Studio 2005 Standard however with Visual Studio 2008 it is only available in Professional and higher editions Windows Phone 7 development support was added to all editions in Visual Studio 2010 Development for Windows Mobile is no longer supported in Visual Studio 2010 It is superseded by Windows Phone 7 Enterprise edit In addition to the features provided by the Professional edition the Enterprise edition provides a new set of software development database development collaboration metrics architecture testing and reporting tools Test Professional edit The Test Professional edition was introduced with Visual Studio 2010 Its focus is the dedicated tester role It includes support for the management of test environments the ability to start and report on tests and to connect to Azure DevOps It does not include support for development or authoring of tests 55 History edit The

the VS codenames related to places 118 in 1997 bundling many of its programming tools together for the first time Visual Studio 97 came in two editions Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise the professional edition has three CDs and the enterprise four CDs It included Visual J 11 for Java programming and introduced Visual InterDev for creating dynamically generated web sites using Active Server Pages citation needed There was a single companion CD that contained the Microsoft Developer Network library Visual Studio 97 was Microsofts first attempt at using the same development environment for multiple languages Visual J InterDev and the MSDN Library had all been using the same environment called Developer Studio 123 Visual Studio was also sold as a bundle with the separate IDEs used for Visual C Visual Basic and Visual FoxPro 20 60 1998 edit The next version version 60 codenamed Aspen after the ski resort in Colorado citation needed was released in June 1998 and is the last version to run on the Windows 9x platform 124 Each version of each language in part also settled to v60 including Visual J which was prior v11 and Visual InterDev at the 1st release The v6 edition of Microsoft was the core environment for the next four releases to provide programmers with an integrated lookalike platform This led Microsoft to transition the development on the platform independent NET Framework Visual Studio 60 was the last version to include Visual J 125 126 which Microsoft removed as part of a settlement with Sun Microsystems that required Microsoft Internet Explorer not to provide support for the Java virtual machine Visual Studio 60 came in two editions Professional and Enterprise 127 The Enterprise edition contained extra features not found in Professional edition including Application Performance Explorer Automation Manager Microsoft Visual Modeler RemAuto Connection Manager citation needed Visual Studio Analyzer Visual Studio was also sold as a bundle with the separate IDEs used for Visual C Visual Basic and Visual FoxPro 20 NET 2002 edit Microsoft released Visual Studio NET VSNET codenamed Rainier for Washingtons Mount Rainier citation needed in February 2002 the beta version was released via Microsoft Developer Network in 2001 The biggest change was the introduction of a managed code development environment using the NET Framework Programs developed using NET are not compiled to machine language like C is for example but instead to a format called Microsoft Intermediate Language MSIL or Common Intermediate Language CIL When a CIL application executes it is compiled while being executed into the appropriate machine language for the platform it is being executed on thereby making code portable across several platforms Programs compiled into CIL can be executed only on platforms which have an implementation of Common Language Infrastructure It is possible to run CIL programs in Linux or Mac OS X using nonMicrosoft NET implementations like Mono and DotGNU This was the first version of Visual Studio to require an NT based Windows platform 128 The installer enforces this requirement Visual Studio NET 2002 shipped in four editions Academic Professional Enterprise Developer and Enterprise Architect Microsoft introduced C Csharp a new programming language that targets NET It also introduced the successor to Visual J called Visual J Visual J programs use Javas languagesyntax However unlike Visual J programs Visual J programs can only target the NET Framework not the Java Virtual Machine that all other Java tools target Visual Basic changed drastically to fit the new framework and the new version was called Visual Basic NET Microsoft also added extensions to C called Managed Extensions for C so NET programs could be created in C Visual Studio NET can produce applications targeting Windows using the Windows Forms part of the NET Framework the Web using ASPNET and Web Services and with an addin portable devices using the NET Compact Framework The Visual Studio NET environment was rewritten to partially use NET All languages are versions of Visual Studio it has a cleaner interface and greater cohesiveness citation needed It is also more customizable with tool windows that automatically hide when not in use While Visual FoxPro 7 started out as part of Visual Studio NET 2002 and early VS betas allowed debugging inside VFPbased DLLs it was removed before release to follow its own development track citation needed The internal version number of Visual Studio NET 2002 is version 70 Microsoft released Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio NET 2002 in March 2005 129 NET 2003 edit In April 2003 Microsoft introduced a minor upgrade to Visual Studio NET called Visual Studio NET 2003 codenamed Everett for the city of the same name citation needed It includes an upgrade to the NET Framework version 11 and is the first release to support developing programs for mobile devices using ASPNET or the NET Compact Framework The Visual C compilers standardscompliance improved especially in the area of partial template specialization Visual C Toolkit 2003 is a version of the same C compiler shipped with Visual Studio NET 2003 without the IDE that Microsoft made freely available As of 2010 update it is no longer available and the Express Editions have superseded it The internal version number of Visual Studio NET 2003 is version 71 while the file format version is 80 130 Visual Studio NET 2003 shipped in five editions Academic Standard Professional Enterprise Developer and Enterprise Architect The Visual Studio NET 2003 Enterprise Architect edition includes an implementation of Microsoft Visio 2002s modeling technologies including tools for creating Unified Modeling Language based visual representations of an applications architecture and an objectrole modeling ORM and logical databasemodeling solution Enterprise Templates were also introduced to help larger development teams standardize coding styles and enforce policies around component usage and property settings Service Pack 1 was released 13 September 2006 131 2005 edit Visual Studio 2005 codenamed Whidbey a reference to Whidbey Island in Puget Sound region citation needed was released online in October 2005 and to retail stores a few weeks later Microsoft removed the NET moniker from Visual Studio 2005 as well as every other product with NET in its name but it still primarily targets the NET Framework which was upgraded to version 20 It is the last version available for Windows 2000 and also the last version to be able to target Windows 98 Windows Me and Windows NT 40 for C applications 132 133 Visual Studio 2005s internal version number is 80 while the file format version is 90 130 Microsoft released Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio 2005 on 14 December 2006 134 An additional update for Service Pack 1 that offers Windows Vista compatibility was made available on 3 June 2007 135 Visual Studio 2005 was upgraded to support all the new features introduced in NET Framework 20 including generics and ASPNET 20 The IntelliSense feature in Visual Studio was upgraded for generics and new project types were added to support ASPNET web services Visual Studio 2005 additionally introduces support for a new taskbased build platform called Microsoft Build Engine MSBuild which employs a new XMLbased project file format 136 Visual Studio 2005 also includes a local web server separate from IIS that can host ASPNET applications during development and testing It also supports all SQL Server 2005 databases Database designers were upgraded to support the ADONET 20 which is included with NET Framework 20 C also got a similar upgrade with the addition of CCLI which is slated to replace the use of Managed C 137 Other new features of Visual Studio 2005 include the Deployment Designer which allows application designs to be validated before deployments an improved environment for web publishing when combined with ASPNET 20 and load testing to see application performance under various sorts of user loads Starting with the 2005 edition Visual Studio also added extensive 64bit support While the host development environment itself is only available as a 32bit application Visual C 2005 supports compiling for x8664 AMD64 and Intel 64 as well as IA64 Itanium 138 The Platform SDK included 64bit compilers and 64bit versions of the libraries Microsoft also announced Visual Studio Tools for Applications as the successor to Visual Basic for Applications VBA and VSA Visual Studio for Applications VSTA 10 was released to manufacturing along with Office 2007 It is included with Office 2007 and is also part of the Visual Studio 2005 SDK VSTA consists of a customized IDE based on the Visual Studio 2005 IDE and a runtime that can be embedded in applications to expose its features via the NET object model Office 2007 applications continue to integrate with VBA except for InfoPath 2007 which integrates with VSTA Version 20 of VSTA based on Visual Studio 2008 was released in April 2008 139 It is significantly different from the first version including features such as dynamic programming and support for WPF WCF WF LINQ and NET 35 Framework 2008 edit Visual Studio 2008 140 and Visual Studio Team System 2008 141 142 codenamed Orcas a reference to Orcas Island also an island in Puget Sound region like Whidbey for the previous 2005 release were released to MSDN subscribers on 19 November 2007 alongside NET Framework 35 The source code for the Visual Studio 2008 IDE is available under a shared source license to some of Microsoft s partners and ISVs 96 Microsoft released Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio 2008 on 11 August 2008 143 The internal version number of Visual Studio 2008 is version 90 while the file format version is 100 Visual Studio 2008 is the last version to support targeting Windows 2000 for C applications 144 Visual Studio 2008 is focused on development of Windows Vista 2007 Office system and Web applications For visual design a new Windows Presentation Foundation visual designer and a new HTML CSS editor influenced by Microsoft Expression Web are included J is not included Visual Studio 2008 requires NET 35 Framework and by default configures compiled assemblies to run on NET Framework 35 but it also supports multitargeting which lets the developers choose which version of the NET Framework out of 20 30 35 Silverlight CoreCLR or NET Compact Framework the assembly runs on Visual Studio 2008 also includes new code analysis tools including the new Code Metrics tool only in Team Edition and Team Suite Edition 145 For Visual C Visual Studio adds a new version of Microsoft Foundation Classes MFC 90 that adds support for the visual styles and UI controls introduced with Windows Vista 146 For native and managed code interoperability Visual C introduces the STLCLR which is a port of the C Standard Template Library STL containers and algorithms to managed code STLCLR defines STLlike containers iterators and algorithms that work on CCLI managed objects 147 148 Visual Studio 2008 features include an XAML based designer codenamed Cider workflow designer LINQ to SQL designer for defining the type mappings and object encapsulation for SQL Server data XSLT debugger JavaScript Intellisense support JavaScript Debugging support support for UAC manifests a concurrent build system among others 149 It ships with an enhanced set of UI widgets both for Windows Forms and WPF It also includes a multithreaded build engine MSBuild to compile multiple source files and build the executable file in a project across multiple threads simultaneously It also includes support for compiling icon resources in PNG format introduced in Windows Vista An updated XML Schema designer was released separately some time after the release of Visual Studio 2008 150 Visual Studio Debugger includes features targeting easier debugging of multithreaded applications In debugging mode in the Threads window which lists all the threads hovering over a thread displays the stack trace of that thread in tooltips 151 The threads can directly be named and flagged for easier identification from that window itself 152 In addition in the code window along with indicating the location of the currently executing instruction in the current thread the currently executing instructions in other threads are also pointed out 152 153 The Visual Studio debugger supports integrated debugging of the NET 35 Framework Base Class Library BCL which can dynamically download the BCL source code and debug symbols and allow stepping into the BCL source during debugging 154 As of 2010 update a limited subset of the BCL source is available with more library support planned for later 2010 edit On 12 April 2010 Microsoft released Visual Studio 2010 codenamed Dev10 89 and NET Framework 4 155 156 The Visual Studio 2010 IDE was redesigned which according to Microsoft clears the UI organization and reduces clutter and complexity 157 The new IDE better supports multiple document windows and floating tool windows 157 while offering better multimonitor support The IDE shell has been rewritten using the Windows Presentation Foundation WPF whereas the internals have been redesigned using Managed Extensibility Framework MEF that offers more extensibility points than previous versions of the IDE that enabled addins to modify the behavior of the IDE 158 The new multiparadigm ML variant F forms part of Visual Studio 2010 159 Visual Studio 2010 comes with NET Framework 4 and supports developing applications targeting Windows 7 157 It supports IBM DB2 and Oracle databases in addition to Microsoft SQL Server 157 It has integrated support for developing Microsoft Silverlight applications including an interactive designer 157 Visual Studio 2010 offers several tools to make parallel programming simpler in addition to the Parallel Extensions for the NET Framework and the Parallel Patterns Library for native code Visual Studio 2010 includes tools for debugging parallel applications The new tools allow the visualization of parallel Tasks and their runtime stacks 160 Tools for profiling parallel applications can be used for visualization of thread waittimes and thread migrations across processor cores 161 Intel and Microsoft have jointly pledged support for a new Concurrency Runtime in Visual Studio 2010 162 and Intel has launched parallelism support in Parallel Studio as an addon for Visual Studio 163 The Visual Studio 2010 code editor now highlights references whenever a symbol is selected all other usages of the symbol are highlighted 164 It also offers a Quick Search feature to incrementally search across all symbols in C C and VBNET projects Quick Search supports substring matches and camelCase searches 164 The Call Hierarchy feature allows the developer to see all the methods that are called from a current method as well as the methods that call the current one 164 IntelliSense in Visual Studio supports a consumefirst mode which developers can opt into In this mode IntelliSense does not autocomplete identifiers this allows the developer to use undefined identifiers like variable or method names and define those later Visual Studio 2010 can also help in this by automatically defining them if it can infer their types from usage 164 Current versions of Visual Studio have a known bug which makes IntelliSense unusable for projects using pure C not C 165 Visual Studio 2010 features a new Help System replacing the MSDN Library viewer The Help System is no longer based on Microsoft Help 2 and does not use Microsoft Document Explorer Dynamic help containing links to related help topics based on where the developer was in the IDE has been removed in the shipping product 166 but can be added back using a download from Microsoft 167 Visual Studio 2010 no longer supports development for Windows Mobile prior to Windows Phone 7 Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 was released in March 2011 168 Ultimate 2010 edit Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 replaces Visual Studio 2008 Team Suite 169 It includes new modeling tools 170 such as the Architecture Explorer which graphically displays projects and classes and the relationships between them 90 171 It supports UML activity diagram component diagram logical class diagram sequence diagram and use case diagram 171 Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also includes Test Impact Analysis which provides hints on which test cases are impacted by modifications to the source code without actually running the test cases 172 This speeds up testing by avoiding running unnecessary test cases Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also includes a historical debugger for managed code called IntelliTrace Unlike a traditional debugger that records only the currently active stack IntelliTrace records all events such as prior function calls method parameters events and exceptions This allows the code execution to be rewound in case a breakpoint was not set where the error occurred 173 Debugging with IntelliTrace causes the application to run more slowly than debugging without it and uses more memory as additional data needs to be recorded Microsoft allows configuration of how much data should be recorded in effect allowing developers to balance the speed of execution and resource usage The Lab Management component of Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 uses virtualization to create a similar execution environment for testers and developers The virtual machines are tagged with checkpoints which can later be investigated for issues as well as to reproduce the issue 174 Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also includes the capability to record test runs that capture the specific state of the operating environment as well as the precise steps used to run the test These steps can then be played back to reproduce issues 175 2012 edit Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 logo The final build of Visual Studio 2012 was announced on 1 August 2012 and the official launch event was held on 12 September 2012 176 Unlike prior

Semantic Colorization 178 On 16 September 2011 a complete Developer Preview of Visual Studio 11 was published on Microsofts website Visual Studio 11 Developer Preview requires Windows 7 Windows Server 2008 R2 Windows 8 or later operating systems 179 Versions of Microsoft Foundation Class Library MFC and C runtime CRT included with this release cannot produce software that is compatible with Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 except by using native multitargeting and foregoing the newest libraries compilers and headers 180 However on 15 June 2012 a blog post on the VC Team blog announced that based on customer feedback Microsoft would reintroduce native support for Windows XP targets though not for XP as a development platform in a version of Visual C to be released later in the fall of 2012 181 Visual Studio 2012 Update 1 Visual Studio 20121 was released in November 2012 This update added support for Windows XP targets and also added other new tools and features eg improved diagnostics and testing support for Windows Store apps 182 On 24 August 2011 a blog post by Sumit Kumar a Program Manager on the Visual C team listed some of the features of the upcoming version of the Visual Studio C IDE 183 Semantic colorization Improved syntax coloring various userdefined or default colors for C syntax such as macros enumerations typenames and functions 183 Reference highlighting Selection of a symbol highlights all of the references to that symbol within scope 183 New Solution Explorer The new Solution Explorer allows for visualization of class and file hierarchies within a solutionproject It can search for calls to functions and uses of classes 183 Automatic display of IntelliSense list IntelliSense is automatically displayed whilst typing code as opposed to previous versions where it had to be explicitly invoked through use of certain operators ie the scope operator or shortcut keys CtrlSpace or CtrlJ 183 Member list filtering IntelliSense uses fuzzy logic to determine which functionsvariablestypes to display in the list 183 Code snippets Code snippets are included in IntelliSense to automatically generate relevant code based on the users parameters custom code snippets can be created 183 The source code of Visual Studio 2012 consists of approximately 50 million lines of code 184 Interface backlash edit During Visual Studio 11 beta Microsoft eliminated the use of color within tools except in cases where color is used for notification or status change purposes However the use of color was returned after feedback demanding more contrast differentiation clarity and energy in the user interface 185 186 In Visual Studio 2012 RC a major change to the interface is the use of allcaps menu bar as part of the campaign to keep Visual Studio consistent with the direction of other Microsoft user interfaces and to provide added structure to the top menu bar area 187 The redesign was criticized for being hard to read and going against the trends started by developers to use CamelCase to make words stand out better 188 Some speculated that the root cause of the redesign was to incorporate the simplistic look and feel of Metro programs 189 However there exists a Windows Registry option to allow users to disable the allcaps interface 190 2013 edit The preview for Visual Studio 2013 was announced at the Build 2013 conference and made available on 26 June 2013 191 The Visual Studio 2013 RC Release Candidate was made available to developers on MSDN on 9 September 2013 192 The final release of Visual Studio 2013
