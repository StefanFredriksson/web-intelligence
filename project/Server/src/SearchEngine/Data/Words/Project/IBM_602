IBM 602 The IBM 602 Calculating Punch introduced in 1946 was an electromechanical calculator capable of addition subtraction multiplication and division The 602 was IBM s first machine that did division The IBM 601 introduced in 1931 only multiplied Like other IBM calculators it was programmed using a control panel Input data was read from a punched card the results could be punched in the same card or a trailing card The 602 was available in four models Model 1 Model 2 Model 50 and Model 51 The Series 50 models were lowcost versions that ran at a slower speed with half as many program steps and fewer storage registers and counters Model Machine Cycles per Minute Program Steps 12Digit Storage Units 6Digit Counters 4Digit Counters Functions 1 200 12 6 3 3 2 200 12 6 3 3 50 150 6 4 3 1 51 150 6 4 3 1 Two additional counters were available as an optional feature Program steps execute in one machine cycle except for steps performing multiplication or division which take as many machine cycles as needed for the operation Punching rate is roughly four columns per machine cycle The total number of machine cycles required per card varies depending on the data and programming Programming the 602 for each problem involved two things A control panel wired for the sequence of the calculation A Skip Bar with inserts placed for the first column of each field to punch See also edit IBM 603 IBM 604 IBM 608 References edit IBM January 1960 IBM Reference Manual 602 Calculating Punch PDF A2205061 mwparseroutput citecitationfontstyleinheritmwparseroutput citation qquotesmwparseroutput citation cs1lockfree abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb665Lockgreensvg9pxLockgreensvgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput citation cs1locklimited amwparseroutput citation cs1lockregistration abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbdd6Lockgrayalt2svg9pxLockgrayalt2svgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput citation cs1locksubscription abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbaaaLockredalt2svg9pxLockredalt2svgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput cs1subscriptionmwparseroutput cs1registrationcolor555mwparseroutput cs1subscription spanmwparseroutput cs1registration spanborderbottom1px dottedcursorhelpmwparseroutput cs1wsicon abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb44cWikisourcelogosvg12pxWikisourcelogosvgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput codecs1codecolorinheritbackgroundinheritborderinheritpaddinginheritmwparseroutput cs1hiddenerrordisplaynonefontsize100mwparseroutput cs1visibleerrorfontsize100mwparseroutput cs1maintdisplaynonecolor33aa33marginleft03emmwparseroutput cs1subscriptionmwparseroutput cs1registrationmwparseroutput cs1formatfontsize95mwparseroutput cs1kernleftmwparseroutput cs1kernwlleftpaddingleft02emmwparseroutput cs1kernrightmwparseroutput cs1kernwlrightpaddingright02em External links edit Columbia University Computing History The IBM 602 Calculating Punch
