Japanese error nihongo Japanese or romaji text required help signboard or billboard is a lean method to manage and improve work across human systems This approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity and by improving the handling of systemlevel bottlenecks Work items are visualized to give participants a view of progress and process from start to finishusually via a Kanban board Work is pulled as capacity permits rather than work being pushed into the process when requested In knowledge work and in software development the aim is to provide a visual process management system which aids decisionmaking about what when and how much to produce The underlying Kanban method originated in lean manufacturing 1 which was inspired by the Toyota Production System 2 Kanban is commonly used in software development in combination with other methods and frameworks such as Scrum 3 Contents 1 Evolution and documentation of method 2 Kanban boards for software development 3 Managing workflow 4 Other examples of use 5 See also 6 References 7 Further reading Evolution and documentation of method edit David Andersons 2010 book Kanban 4 describes an evolution of the approach from a 2004 project at Microsoft 5 using a theory of constraints approach and incorporating a drumbufferrope which is comparable to the kanban pull system to a 20062007 project at Corbis in which the kanban method was identified In 2009 Don Reinertsen published a book on secondgeneration lean product development 6 which describes the adoption of the kanban system and the use of data collection and an economic model for management decisionmaking Another early contribution came from Corey Ladas whose 2008 book Scrumban 3 suggested that kanban could improve Scrum for software development Ladas saw Scrumban as the transition from Scrum to Kanban Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry published Personal Kanban 7 applying Kanban to individuals and small teams in 2011 In Kanban from the Inside 2014 8 Mike Burrows explained kanbans principles practices and underlying values and related them to earlier theories and models In Agile Project Management with Kanban 2015 9 Eric Brechner provides an overview of Kanban in practice at Microsoft and Xbox Kanban Change Leadership 2015 by Klaus Leopold and Siegfried Kaltenecker 10 explained the method from the perspective of change management and provided guidance to change initiatives A condensed guide to the method was published in 2016 incorporating improvements and extensions from the early kanban projects 11 Kanban boards for software development edit Main article Kanban board The diagram here shows a software development workflow on a Kanban board 12 Kanban boards designed for the context in which they are used vary considerably and may show work item types features and user stories here columns delineating workflow activities explicit policies and swimlanes rows crossing several columns used for grouping user stories by feature here The aim is to make the general workflow and the progress of individual items clear to participants and stakeholders As described in books on Kanban for software development 4 3 the two primary practices of Kanban are Visualize your work Limit work in progress WIP Four additional general practices of Kanban listed in Essential Kanban Condensed 11 are Make policies explicit Manage flow Implement feedback loops Improve collaboratively evolve experimentally The Kanban board in the diagram above highlights the first three general practices of Kanban It visualizes the work of the development team the features and user stories It captures WIP limits for development steps the circled values below the column headings that limit the number of work items under that step It documents policies also known as done rules 9 inside blue rectangles under some of the development steps It also shows some Kanban flow management for the User Story Preparation User Story Development and Feature Acceptance steps which have In Progress and Ready subcolumns Each steps WIP limit applies to both subcolumns preventing work items from overwhelming the flow into or out of those steps Managing workflow edit Kanban manages workflow directly on the Kanban board The WIP limits for development steps provide development teams immediate feedback on common workflow issues 4 9 For example on the Kanban board shown above the Deployment step has a WIP limit of five 5 and there are currently five epics shown in that step No more work items can move into deployment until one or more epics complete that step moving to Delivered This prevents the Deployment step from being overwhelmed Team members working on Feature Acceptance the previous step might get stuck because they cant deploy new epics They can see why immediately on the board and help with the current epic deployments Once the five epics in the Deployment step are delivered the two epics from the Ready subcolumn of Feature Acceptance the previous step can be moved to the Deployment column When those two epics are delivered no other epics can be deployed assuming no new epics are ready Now team members working on deployment are stuck They can see why immediately and help with feature acceptance This workflow control works similarly for every step Problems are visual and evident immediately and replanning can be done continuously The work management is made possible by limiting work in progress in a way team members can see and track at all times Other examples of use edit Although it is usually used for software development and software teams the kanban method has been applied to other aspects of knowledge work 13 Business functions which have used kanban include Human resources 14 and recruitment 15 Marketing Organizational strategy and executive leadership 16 See also edit Lean software development List of software development philosophies References edit James P Womack 2007
