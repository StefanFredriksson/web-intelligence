The thinker v t e Intelligence has been defined in many ways the capacity for logic understanding selfawareness learning emotional knowledge reasoning planning creativity critical thinking and problem solving More generally it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both nonhuman animals and in plants Intelligence in machines is called artificial intelligence which is commonly implemented in computer systems using programs and sometimes specialized hardware mwparseroutput toclimit2 toclevel1 ulmwparseroutput toclimit3 toclevel2 ulmwparseroutput toclimit4 toclevel3 ulmwparseroutput

nouns intelligentia or intellēctus which in turn stem from the verb intelligere to comprehend or perceive In the Middle Ages the word intellectus became the scholarly technical term for understanding and a translation for the Greek philosophical term nous This term however was strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism including theories of the immortality of the soul and the concept of the Active Intellect also known as the Active Intelligence This entire approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the early modern philosophers such as Francis Bacon Thomas Hobbes John Locke and David Hume all of whom preferred the word understanding in place of intellectus or intelligence in their English philosophical works 1 2 Hobbes for example in his Latin De Corpore used intellectus intelligit translated in the English version as the understanding understandeth as a typical example of a logical absurdity 3 The term intelligence has therefore become less common in English language philosophy but it has later been taken up with the scholastic theories which it now implies in more contemporary psychology 4 Definitions edit The definition of intelligence is controversial 5 Some groups of psychologists have suggested the following definitions From Mainstream Science on Intelligence 1994 an oped statement in the Wall Street Journal signed by fiftytwo researchers out of 131 total invited to sign 6 mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 A very general mental capability that among other things involves the ability to reason plan solve problems think abstractly comprehend complex ideas learn quickly and learn from experience It is not merely book learning a narrow academic skill or testtaking smarts Rather it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundingscatching on making sense of things or figuring out what to do 7 From Intelligence Knowns and Unknowns 1995 a report published by the Board of Scientific Affairs of the American Psychological Association Individuals differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas to adapt effectively to the environment to learn from experience to engage in various forms of reasoning to overcome obstacles by taking thought Although these individual differences can be substantial they are never entirely consistent a given persons intellectual performance will vary on different occasions in different domains as judged by different criteria Concepts of intelligence are attempts to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena Although considerable clarity has been achieved in some areas no such conceptualization has yet answered all the important questions and none commands universal assent Indeed when two dozen prominent theorists were recently asked to define intelligence they gave two dozen somewhat different definitions 8 Besides those definitions psychology and learning researchers also have suggested definitions of intelligence such as the following Researcher Quotation Alfred Binet Judgment otherwise called good sense practical sense initiative the faculty of adapting ones self to circumstances autocritique 9 David Wechsler The aggregate or global capacity of the individual to act purposefully to think rationally and to deal effectively with his environment 10 Lloyd Humphreys the resultant of the process of acquiring storing in memory retrieving combining comparing and using in new contexts information and conceptual skills 11 Howard Gardner To my mind a human intellectual competence must entail a set of skills of problem solving enabling the individual to resolve genuine problems or difficulties that he or she encounters and when appropriate to create an effective product and must also entail the potential for finding or creating problems and thereby laying the groundwork for the acquisition of new knowledge 12 Linda Gottfredson The ability to deal with cognitive complexity 13 Robert Sternberg William Salter Goaldirected adaptive behavior 14 Reuven Feuerstein The theory of Structural Cognitive Modifiability describes intelligence as the unique propensity of human beings to change or modify the structure of their cognitive functioning to adapt to the changing demands of a life situation 15 Shane Legg Marcus Hutter A synthesis of 70 definitions from psychology philosophy and AI researchers Intelligence measures an agents ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments 5 which has been mathematically formalized 16 Alexander WissnerGross F T S τ displaystyle tau 17 Intelligence is a force F that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action It acts to maximize future freedom of action or keep options open with some strength T with the diversity of possible accessible futures S up to some future time horizon τ In short intelligence doesnt like to get trapped Human intelligence edit Main article Human intelligence Human intelligence is the intellectual power of humans which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and selfawareness 18 Intelligence enables humans to remember descriptions of things and use those descriptions in future behaviors It is a cognitive process It gives humans the cognitive abilities to learn form concepts understand and reason including the capacities to recognize patterns comprehend ideas plan solve problems and use language to communicate Intelligence enables humans to experience and think Much of the above definition applies also to the intelligence of nonhuman animals In animals edit Main article Animal cognition The common chimpanzee can use tools This chimpanzee is using a stick to get food Although humans have been the primary focus of intelligence researchers scientists have also attempted to investigate animal intelligence or more broadly animal cognition These researchers are interested in studying both mental ability in a particular species and comparing abilities between species They study various measures of problem solving as well as numerical and verbal reasoning abilities Some challenges in this area are defining intelligence so that it has the same meaning across species eg comparing intelligence between literate humans and illiterate animals and also operationalizing a measure that accurately compares mental ability across different species and contexts Wolfgang Köhler s research on the intelligence of apes is an example of research in this area Stanley Corens book The Intelligence of Dogs is a notable book on the topic of dog intelligence 19 See also Dog intelligence Nonhuman animals particularly noted and studied for their intelligence include chimpanzees bonobos notably the languageusing Kanzi and other great apes dolphins elephants and to some extent parrots rats and ravens Cephalopod intelligence also provides important comparative study Cephalopods appear to exhibit characteristics of significant intelligence yet their nervous systems differ radically from those of backboned animals Vertebrates such as mammals birds reptiles and fish have shown a fairly high degree of intellect that varies according to each species The same is true with arthropods g factor in nonhumans edit Main article g Factor in NonHumans Evidence of a general factor of intelligence has been observed in nonhuman animals The general factor of intelligence or g factor is a psychometric construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individuals scores on a wide range of cognitive abilities First described in humans the g factor has since been identified in a number of nonhuman species 20 Cognitive ability and intelligence cannot be measured using the same largely verbally dependent scales developed for humans Instead intelligence is measured using a variety of interactive and observational tools focusing on innovation habit reversal social learning and responses to novelty Studies have shown that g is responsible for 47 of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in primates 20 and between 55 and 60 of the variance in mice Locurto Locurto These values are similar to the accepted variance in IQ explained by g in humans 4050 21 In plants edit Main article Plant intelligence It has been argued that plants should also be classified as intelligent based on their ability to sense and model external and internal environments and adjust their morphology physiology and phenotype accordingly to ensure selfpreservation and reproduction 22 23 A counter argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the creation and use of persistent memories as opposed to computation that does not involve learning If this is accepted as definitive of intelligence then it includes the artificial intelligence of robots capable of machine learning but excludes those purely autonomic sensereaction responses that can be observed in many plants Plants are not limited to automated sensorymotor responses however they are capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of learning registering memories from their past experiences They are also capable of communication accurately computing their circumstances using sophisticated costbenefit analysis and taking tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control the diverse environmental stressors 24 25 26 Artificial intelligence edit Main article Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence or AI is both the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science which aims to create it through the study and design of intelligent agents 27 or rational agents where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success 28 Kaplan and Haenlein define artificial intelligence as a systems ability to correctly interpret external data to learn from such data and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation 29 Achievements in artificial intelligence include constrained and welldefined problems such as games crossword solving and optical character recognition and a few more general problems such as autonomous cars 30 General intelligence or strong AI has not yet been achieved and is a longterm goal of AI research Among the traits that researchers hope machines will exhibit are reasoning knowledge planning learning communication perception and the ability to move and to manipulate objects 27 28 In the field of artificial intelligence there is no consensus on how closely the brain should be simulated See also edit Philosophy portal Psychology portal Active intellect CattellHornCarroll theory Intellect Intelligence journal Knowledge Neuroscience and
