Turing test For other uses see Turing test disambiguation The standard interpretation of the Turing test in which player C the interrogator is given the task of trying to determine which player A or B is a computer and which is a human The interrogator is limited to using the responses to written questions to make the determination 1 Artificial intelligence Major goals Knowledge reasoning Planning

developed by Alan Turing in 1950 is a test of a machines ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to or indistinguishable from that of a human Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate humanlike responses The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine and all participants would be separated from one another The conversation would be limited to a textonly channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so the result would not depend on the machines ability to render words as speech 2 If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human the machine is said to have passed the test The test results do not depend on the machines ability to give correct answers to questions only how closely its answers resemble those a human would give The test was introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence while working at the University of Manchester Turing 1950 p460 3 It opens with the words I propose to consider the question Can machines think Because thinking is difficult to define Turing chooses to replace the question by another which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words 4 Turing describes the new form of the problem in terms of a threeperson game called the imitation game in which an interrogator asks questions of a man and a woman in another room in order to determine the correct sex of the two players Turings new question is Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game 5 This question Turing believed is one that can actually be answered In the remainder of the paper he argued against all the major objections to the proposition that machines can think 6 Since Turing first introduced his test it has proven to be both highly influential and widely criticised and it has become an important concept

whether it is possible for machines to think has a long history which is firmly entrenched in the distinction between dualist and materialist views of the mind René Descartes prefigures aspects of the Turing test in his 1637 Discourse on the Method when he writes mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 How many different automata or moving machines can be made by the industry of man For we can easily understand a machines being constituted so that it can utter words and even emit some responses to action on it of a corporeal kind which brings about a change in its organs for instance if touched in a particular part it may ask what we wish to say to it if in another part it may exclaim that it is being hurt and so on But it never happens that it arranges its speech in various ways in order to reply appropriately to everything that may be said in its presence as even the lowest type of man can do 9 Here Descartes notes that automata are capable of responding to human interactions but argues that such automata cannot respond appropriately to things said in their presence in the way that any human can Descartes therefore prefigures the Turing test by defining the insufficiency of appropriate linguistic response as that which separates the human from the automaton Descartes fails to consider the possibility that future automata might be able to overcome such insufficiency and so does not propose the Turing test as such even if he prefigures its conceptual framework and criterion Denis Diderot formulates in his Pensées philosophiques a Turingtest criterion If they find a parrot who could answer to everything I would claim it to be an intelligent being without hesitation 10 This does not mean he agrees with this but that it was already a common argument of materialists at that time According to dualism the mind is nonphysical or at the very least has nonphysical properties 11 and therefore cannot be explained in purely physical terms According to materialism the mind can be explained physically which leaves open the possibility of minds that are produced artificially 12 In 1936 philosopher Alfred Ayer considered the standard philosophical question of other minds how do we know that other people have the same conscious experiences that we do In his book Language Truth and Logic Ayer suggested a protocol to distinguish between a conscious man and an unconscious machine The only ground I can have for asserting that an object which appears to be conscious is not really a conscious being but only a dummy or a machine is that it fails to satisfy one of the empirical tests by which the presence or absence of consciousness is determined 13 This suggestion is very similar to the Turing test but is concerned with consciousness rather than intelligence Moreover it is not certain that Ayers popular philosophical classic was familiar to Turing In other words a thing is not conscious if it fails the consciousness test Alan Turing edit Researchers in the United Kingdom had been exploring machine intelligence for up to ten years prior to the founding of the field of artificial intelligence AI research in 1956 14 It was a common topic among the members of the Ratio Club an informal group of British cybernetics and electronics researchers that included Alan Turing 15 Turing in particular had been tackling the notion of machine intelligence since at least 1941 16 and one of the earliestknown mentions of computer intelligence was made by him in 1947 17 In Turings report Intelligent Machinery 18 he investigated the question of whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour 19 and as part of that investigation proposed what may be considered the forerunner to his later tests It is not difficult to devise a paper machine which will play a not very bad game of chess 20 Now get three men as subjects for the experiment A B and C A and C are to be rather poor chess players B is the operator who works the paper machine Two rooms are used with some arrangement for communicating moves and a game is played between C and either A or the paper machine C may find it quite difficult to tell which he is playing 21 Computing Machinery and Intelligence 1950 was the first published paper by Turing to focus exclusively on machine intelligence Turing begins the 1950 paper with the claim I propose to consider the question Can machines think 4 As he highlights the traditional approach to such a question is to start with definitions defining both the terms machine and intelligence Turing chooses not to do so instead he replaces the question with a new one which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words 4 In essence he proposes to change the question from Can machines think to Can machines do what we as thinking entities can do 22 The advantage of the new question Turing argues is that it draws a fairly sharp line between the physical and intellectual capacities of a man 23 To demonstrate this approach Turing proposes a test inspired by a party game known as the imitation game in which a man and a woman go into separate rooms and guests try to tell them apart by writing a series of questions and reading the typewritten answers sent back In this game both the man and the woman aim to convince the guests that they are the other Huma Shah argues that this twohuman version of the game was presented by Turing only to introduce the reader to the machinehuman questionanswer test 24 Turing described his new version of the game as follows We now ask the question What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman These questions replace our original Can machines think 23 Later in the paper Turing suggests an equivalent alternative formulation involving a judge conversing only with a computer and a man 25 While neither of these formulations precisely matches the version of the Turing test that is more generally known today he proposed a third in 1952 In this version which Turing discussed in a BBC radio broadcast a jury asks questions of a computer and the role of the computer is to make a significant proportion of the jury believe that it is really a man 26 Turings paper considered nine putative objections which include all the major arguments against artificial intelligence that have been raised in the years since the paper was published see Computing Machinery and Intelligence 6 ELIZA and PARRY edit In 1966 Joseph Weizenbaum created a program which appeared to pass the Turing test The program known as ELIZA worked by examining a users typed comments for keywords If a keyword is found a rule that transforms the users comments is applied and the resulting sentence is returned If a keyword is not found ELIZA responds either with a generic riposte or by repeating one of the earlier comments 27 In addition Weizenbaum developed ELIZA to replicate the behaviour of a Rogerian psychotherapist allowing ELIZA to be free to assume the pose of knowing almost nothing of the real world 28 With these techniques Weizenbaums program was able to fool some people into believing that they were talking to a real person with some subjects being very hard to convince that ELIZA is not human 28 Thus ELIZA is claimed by some to be one of the programs perhaps the first able to pass the Turing test 28 29 even though this view is highly contentious see below Kenneth Colby created PARRY in 1972 a program described as ELIZA with attitude 30 It attempted to model the behaviour of a paranoid schizophrenic using a similar if more advanced approach to that employed by Weizenbaum To validate the work PARRY was tested in the early 1970s using a variation of the Turing test A group of experienced psychiatrists analysed a combination of real patients and computers running PARRY through teleprinters Another group of 33 psychiatrists were shown transcripts of the conversations The two groups were then asked to identify which of the patients were human and which were computer programs 31 The psychiatrists were able to make the correct identification only 48 percent of the time a figure consistent with random guessing 32 In the 21st century versions of these programs now known as chatterbots continue to fool people CyberLover a malware program preys on Internet users by convincing them to reveal information about their identities or to lead them to visit a web site that will deliver malicious content to their computers 33 The program has emerged as a Valentinerisk flirting with people seeking relationships online in order to collect their personal data 34 The Chinese room edit Main article Chinese room John Searle s 1980 paper Minds Brains and Programs proposed the Chinese room thought experiment and argued that the Turing test could not be used to determine if a machine can think Searle noted that software such as ELIZA could pass the Turing test simply by manipulating symbols of which they had no understanding Without understanding they could not be described as thinking in the same sense people are Therefore Searle concludes the Turing test cannot prove that a machine can think 35 Much like the Turing test itself Searles argument has been both widely criticised 36 and highly endorsed 37 Arguments such as Searles and others working on the philosophy of mind sparked off a more intense debate about the nature of intelligence the possibility of intelligent machines and the value of the Turing test that continued through the 1980s and 1990s 38 Loebner Prize edit Main article Loebner Prize The Loebner Prize provides an annual platform for practical Turing tests with the first competition held in November 1991 39 It is underwritten by Hugh Loebner The Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies in Massachusetts United States organised the prizes up to and including the 2003 contest As Loebner described it one reason the competition was created is to advance the state of AI research at least in part because no one had taken steps to implement the Turing test despite 40 years of discussing it 40 The first Loebner Prize competition in 1991 led to a renewed discussion of the viability of the Turing test and the value of pursuing it in both the popular press 41 and academia 42 The first contest was won by a mindless program with no identifiable intelligence that managed to fool naïve interrogators into making the wrong identification This highlighted several of the shortcomings of the Turing test discussed below The winner won at least in part because it was able to imitate human typing errors 41 the unsophisticated interrogators were easily fooled 42 and some researchers in AI have been led to feel that the test is merely a distraction from more fruitful research 43 The silver text only and gold audio and visual prizes have never been won However the competition has awarded the bronze medal every year for the computer system that in the judges opinions demonstrates the most human conversational behaviour among that years entries Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity ALICE has won the bronze award on three occasions in recent times 2000 2001 2004 Learning AI Jabberwacky won in 2005 and 2006 The Loebner Prize tests conversational intelligence winners are typically chatterbot programs or Artificial Conversational Entities ACEs Early Loebner Prize rules restricted conversations Each entry and hiddenhuman conversed on a single topic 44 thus the interrogators were restricted to one line of questioning per entity interaction The restricted conversation rule was lifted for the 1995 Loebner Prize Interaction duration between judge and entity has varied in Loebner Prizes In Loebner 2003 at the University of Surrey each interrogator was allowed five minutes to interact with an entity machine or hiddenhuman Between 2004 and 2007 the interaction time allowed in Loebner Prizes was more than twenty minutes Versions edit The imitation game as described by Alan Turing in Computing Machinery and Intelligence Player C through a series of written questions attempts to determine which of the other two players is a man and which of the two is the woman Player A the man tries to trick player C into making the wrong decision while player B tries to help player C Figure adapted from Saygin 2000 7 Saul Traiger argues that there are at least three primary versions of the Turing test two of which are offered in Computing Machinery and Intelligence and one that he describes as the Standard Interpretation 45 While there is some debate regarding whether the Standard Interpretation is that described by Turing or instead based on a misreading of his paper these three versions are not regarded as equivalent 45 and their strengths and weaknesses are distinct 46 Huma Shah points out that Turing himself was concerned with whether a machine could think and was providing a simple method to examine this through humanmachine questionanswer sessions 47 Shah argues there is one imitation game which Turing described could be practicalised in two different ways a onetoone interrogatormachine test and b simultaneous comparison of a machine with a human both questioned in parallel by an interrogator 24 Since the Turing test is a test of indistinguishability in performance capacity the verbal version generalises naturally to all of human performance capacity verbal as well as nonverbal robotic 48 Imitation game edit Turings original article describes a simple party game involving three players Player A is a man player B is a woman and player C who plays the role of the interrogator is of either sex In the imitation game player C is unable to see either player A or player B and can communicate with them only through written notes By asking questions of player A and player B player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman Player As role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one 7 Turing then asks What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman These questions replace our original Can machines think 23 The original imitation game test in which the player A is replaced with a computer The computer is now charged with the role of the man while player B continues to attempt to assist the interrogator Figure adapted from Saygin 2000 7 The second version appeared later in Turings 1950 paper Similar to the original imitation game test the role of player A is performed by a computer However the role of player B is performed by a man rather than a woman Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage suitably increasing its speed of action and providing it with an appropriate programme C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game the part of B being taken by a man 23 In this version both player A the computer and player B are trying to trick the interrogator into making an incorrect decision Standard interpretation edit Common understanding has it that the purpose of the Turing test is not specifically to determine whether a computer is able to fool an interrogator into believing that it is a human but rather whether a computer could imitate a human 7 While there is some dispute whether this interpretation was intended by Turing Sterrett believes that it was 49 and thus conflates the second version with this one while others such as Traiger do not 45 this has nevertheless led to what can be viewed as the standard interpretation In this version player A is a computer and player B a person of either sex The role of the interrogator is not to determine which is male and which is female but which is a computer and which is a human 50 The fundamental issue with the standard interpretation is that the interrogator cannot differentiate which responder is human and which is machine There are issues about duration but the standard interpretation generally considers this limitation as something that should be reasonable Imitation game vs standard Turing test edit Controversy has arisen over which of the alternative formulations of the test Turing intended 49 Sterrett argues that two distinct tests can be extracted from his 1950 paper and that pace Turings remark they are not equivalent The test that employs the party game and compares frequencies of success is referred to as the Original Imitation Game Test whereas the test consisting of a human judge conversing with a human and a machine is referred to as the Standard Turing Test noting that Sterrett equates this with the standard interpretation rather than the second version of the imitation game Sterrett agrees that the standard Turing test STT has the problems that its critics cite but feels that in contrast the original imitation game test OIG test so defined is immune to many of them due to a crucial difference Unlike the STT it does not make similarity to human performance the criterion even though it employs human performance in setting a criterion for machine intelligence A man can fail the OIG test but it is argued that it is a virtue of a test of intelligence that failure indicates a lack of resourcefulness The OIG test requires the resourcefulness associated with intelligence and not merely simulation of human conversational behaviour The general structure of the OIG test could even be used with nonverbal versions of imitation games 51 Still other writers 52 have interpreted Turing as proposing that the imitation game itself is the test without specifying how to take into account Turings statement that the test that he proposed using the party version of the imitation game is based upon a criterion of comparative frequency of success in that imitation game rather than a capacity to succeed at one round of the game Saygin has suggested that maybe the original game is a way of proposing a less biased experimental design as it hides the participation of the computer 53 The imitation game also includes a social hack not found in the standard interpretation as in the game both computer and male human are required to play as pretending to be someone they are not 54 Should the interrogator know about the computer edit A crucial piece of any laboratory test is that there should be a control Turing never makes clear whether the interrogator in his tests is aware that one of the participants is a computer However if there were a machine that did have the potential to pass a Turing test it would be safe to assume a double blind control would be necessary To return to the original imitation game he states only that player A is to be replaced with a machine not that player C is to be made aware of this replacement 23 When Colby FD Hilf S Weber and AD Kramer tested PARRY they did so by assuming that the interrogators did not need to know that one or more of those being interviewed was a computer during the interrogation 55 As Ayse Saygin Peter Swirski 56 and others have highlighted this makes a big difference to the implementation and outcome of the test 7 An experimental study looking at Gricean maxim violations using transcripts of Loebners onetoone interrogatorhidden interlocutor Prize for AI contests between 19941999 Ayse Saygin found significant differences between the responses of participants who knew and did not know about computers being involved 57 Strengths edit Tractability and simplicity edit The power and appeal of the Turing test derives from its simplicity The philosophy of mind psychology and modern neuroscience have been unable to provide definitions of intelligence and thinking that are sufficiently precise and general to be applied to machines Without such definitions the central questions of the philosophy of artificial intelligence cannot be answered The Turing test even if imperfect at least provides something that can actually be measured As such it is a pragmatic attempt to answer a difficult philosophical question Breadth of subject matter edit The format of the test allows the interrogator to give the machine a wide variety of intellectual tasks Turing wrote that the question and answer method seems to be suitable for introducing almost any one of the fields of human endeavour that we wish to include 58 John Haugeland adds that understanding the words is not enough you have to understand the topic as well 59 To pass a welldesigned Turing test the machine must use natural language reason have knowledge and learn The test can be extended to include video input as well as a hatch through which objects can be passed this would force the machine to demonstrate skilled use of well designed vision and robotics as well Together these represent almost all of the major problems that artificial intelligence research would like to solve 60 The Feigenbaum test is designed to take advantage of the broad range of topics available to a Turing test It is a limited form of Turings questionanswer game which compares the machine against the abilities of experts in specific fields such as literature or chemistry IBM s Watson machine achieved success in a man versus machine television quiz show of human knowledge Jeopardy 61 relevant to this paragraph discuss Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence edit As a Cambridge honours graduate in mathematics Turing might have been expected to propose a test of computer intelligence requiring expert knowledge in some highly technical field and thus anticipating a more recent approach to the subject Instead as already noted the test which he described in his seminal 1950 paper requires the computer to be able to compete successfully in a common party game and this by performing as well as the typical man in answering a series of questions so as to pretend convincingly to be the woman contestant Given the status of human sexual dimorphism as one of the most ancient of subjects it is thus implicit in the above scenario that the questions to be answered will involve neither specialised factual knowledge nor information processing technique The challenge for the computer rather will be to demonstrate empathy for the role of the female and to demonstrate as well a characteristic aesthetic sensibilityboth of which qualities are on display in this snippet of dialogue which Turing has imagined Interrogator Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair Contestant My hair is shingled and the longest strands are about nine inches long When Turing does introduce some specialised knowledge into one of his imagined dialogues the subject is not maths or electronics but poetry Interrogator In the first line of your sonnet which reads Shall I compare thee to a summers day would not a spring day do as well or better Witness It wouldnt scan Interrogator How about a winters day That would scan all right Witness Yes but nobody wants to be compared to a winters day Turing thus once again demonstrates his interest in empathy and aesthetic sensitivity as components of an artificial intelligence and in light of an increasing awareness of the threat from an AI run amok 62 it has been suggested 63 that this focus perhaps represents a critical intuition on Turings part ie that emotional and aesthetic intelligence will play a key role in the creation of a friendly AI It is further noted however that whatever inspiration Turing might be able to lend in this direction depends upon the preservation of his original vision which is to say further that the promulgation of a standard interpretation of the Turing testie one which focuses on a discursive intelligence onlymust be regarded with some caution Weaknesses edit Turing did not explicitly state that the Turing test could be used as a measure of intelligence or any other human quality He wanted to provide a clear and understandable alternative to the word think which he could then use to reply to criticisms of the possibility of thinking machines and to suggest ways that research might move forward Nevertheless the Turing test has been proposed as a measure of a machines ability to think or its intelligence This proposal has received criticism from both philosophers and computer scientists It assumes that an interrogator can determine if a machine is thinking by comparing its behaviour with human behaviour Every element of this assumption has been questioned the reliability of the interrogators judgement the value of comparing only behaviour and the value of comparing the machine with a human Because of these and other considerations some AI researchers have questioned the relevance of the test to their field Human intelligence vs intelligence in general edit The Turing test does not directly test whether the computer behaves intelligently It tests only whether the computer behaves like a human being Since human behaviour and intelligent behaviour are not exactly the same thing the test can fail to accurately measure intelligence in two ways Some human behaviour is unintelligent The Turing test requires that the machine be able to execute all human behaviours regardless of whether they are intelligent It even tests for behaviours that may not be considered intelligent at all such as the susceptibility to insults 64 the temptation to lie or simply a high frequency of typing mistakes If a machine cannot imitate these unintelligent behaviours in detail it fails the test This objection was raised by The Economist in an article entitled artificial stupidity published shortly after the first Loebner Prize competition in 1992 The article noted that the first Loebner winners victory was due at least in part to its ability to imitate human typing errors 41 Turing himself had suggested that programs add errors into their output so as to be better players of the game 65 Some intelligent behaviour is inhuman The Turing test does not test for highly intelligent behaviours such as the ability to solve difficult problems or come up with original insights In fact it specifically requires deception on the part of the machine if the machine is more intelligent than a human being it must deliberately avoid appearing too intelligent If it were to solve a computational problem that is practically impossible for a human to solve then the interrogator would know the program is not human and the machine would fail the test Because it cannot measure intelligence that is beyond the ability of humans the test cannot be used to build or evaluate systems that are more intelligent than humans Because of this several test alternatives that would be able to evaluate superintelligent systems have been proposed 66 Consciousness vs the simulation of consciousness edit Main article Chinese room See also Synthetic intelligence The Turing test is concerned strictly with how the subject acts the external behaviour of the machine In this regard it takes a behaviourist or functionalist approach to the study of the mind The example of ELIZA suggests that a machine passing the test may be able to simulate human conversational behaviour by following a simple but large list of mechanical rules without thinking or having a mind at all John Searle has argued that external behaviour cannot be used to determine if a machine is actually thinking or merely simulating thinking 35 His Chinese room argument is intended to show that even if the Turing test is a good operational definition of intelligence it may not indicate that the machine has a mind consciousness or intentionality Intentionality is a philosophical term for the power of thoughts to be about something Turing anticipated this line of criticism in his original paper 67 writing I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness There is for instance something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper 68 Naïveté of interrogators and the anthropomorphic fallacy edit In practice the tests results can easily be dominated not by the computers intelligence but by the attitudes skill or naïveté of the questioner Turing does not specify the precise skills and knowledge required by the interrogator in his description of the test but he did use the term average interrogator the average interrogator would not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning 69 Chatterbot programs such as ELIZA have repeatedly fooled unsuspecting people into believing that they are communicating with human beings In these cases the interrogators are not even aware of the possibility that they are interacting with computers To successfully appear human there is no need for the machine to have any intelligence whatsoever and only a superficial resemblance to human behaviour is required Early Loebner Prize competitions used unsophisticated interrogators who were easily fooled by the machines 42 Since 2004 the Loebner Prize organisers have deployed philosophers computer scientists and journalists among the interrogators Nonetheless some of these experts have been deceived by the machines 70 Michael Shermer points out that human beings consistently choose to consider nonhuman objects as human whenever they are allowed the chance a mistake called the anthropomorphic fallacy They talk to their cars ascribe desire and intentions to natural forces eg nature abhors a vacuum and worship the sun as a humanlike being with intelligence If the Turing test is applied to religious objects Shermer argues then that inanimate statues rocks and places have consistently passed the test throughout history citation needed This human tendency towards anthropomorphism effectively lowers the bar for the Turing test unless interrogators are specifically trained to avoid it Human misidentification edit One interesting feature of the Turing test is the frequency of the confederate effect when the confederate tested humans are misidentified by the interrogators as machines It has been suggested that what interrogators expect as human responses is not necessarily typical of humans As a result some individuals can be categorised as machines This can therefore work in favour of a competing machine The humans are instructed to act themselves but sometimes their answers are more like what the interrogator expects a machine to say 71 This raises the question of how to ensure that the humans are motivated to act human Silence edit A critical aspect of the Turing test is that a machine must give itself away as being a machine by its utterances An interrogator must then make the right identification by correctly identifying the machine as being just that If however a machine remains silent during a conversation ie takes the fifth then it is not possible for an interrogator to accurately identify the machine other than by means of a calculated guess 72 Even taking into account a parallelhidden human as part of the test may not help the situation as humans can often be misidentified as being a machine 73 Impracticality and irrelevance the Turing test and AI research edit Mainstream AI researchers argue that trying to pass the Turing test is merely a distraction from more fruitful research 43 Indeed the Turing test is not an active focus of much academic or commercial effortas Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig write AI researchers have devoted little attention to passing the Turing test 74 There are several reasons First there are easier ways to test their programs Most current research in AIrelated fields is aimed at modest and specific goals such as automated scheduling object recognition or logistics To test the intelligence of the programs that solve these problems AI researchers simply give them the task directly Russell and Norvig suggest an analogy with the history of flight Planes are tested by how well they fly not by comparing them to birds Aeronautical engineering texts they write do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons 74 Second creating lifelike simulations of human beings is a difficult problem on its own that does not need to be solved to achieve the basic goals of AI research Believable human characters may be interesting in a work of art a game or a sophisticated user interface but they are not part of the science of creating intelligent machines that is machines that solve problems using intelligence Turing wanted to provide a clear and understandable example to aid in the discussion of the philosophy of artificial intelligence 75 John McCarthy observes that the philosophy of AI is unlikely to have any more effect on the practice of AI research than philosophy of science generally has on the practice of science 76 Cognitive science edit Robert French 1990 makes the case that an interrogator can distinguish human and nonhuman interlocutors by posing questions that reveal the lowlevel ie unconscious processes of human cognition as studied by cognitive science Such questions reveal the precise details of the human embodiment of thought and can unmask a computer unless it experiences the world as humans do 77 Variations edit Numerous other versions of the Turing test including those expounded above have been raised through the years Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA edit Main articles Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA A modification of the Turing test wherein the objective of one or more of the roles have been reversed between machines and humans is termed a reverse Turing test An example is implied in the work of psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion 78 who was particularly fascinated by the storm that resulted from the encounter of one mind by another In his 2000 book 56 among several other original points with regard to the Turing test literary scholar Peter Swirski discussed in detail the idea of what he termed the Swirski testessentially the reverse Turing test He pointed out that it overcomes most if not all standard objections levelled at the standard version Carrying this idea forward R D Hinshelwood 79 described the mind as a mind recognizing apparatus The challenge would be for the computer to be able to determine if it were interacting with a human or another computer This is an extension of the original question that Turing attempted to answer but would perhaps offer a high enough standard to define a machine that could think in a way that we typically define as characteristically human CAPTCHA is a form of reverse Turing test Before being allowed to perform some action on a website the user is presented with alphanumerical characters in a distorted graphic image and asked to type them out This is intended to prevent automated systems from being used to abuse the site The rationale is that software sufficiently sophisticated to read and reproduce the distorted image accurately does not exist or is not available to the average user so any system able to do so is likely to be a human Software that could reverse CAPTCHA with some accuracy by analysing patterns in the generating engine started being developed soon after the creation of CAPTCHA 80 In 2013 researchers at Vicarious announced that they had developed a system to solve CAPTCHA challenges from Google Yahoo and PayPal up to 90 of the time 81 In 2014 Google engineers demonstrated a system that could defeat CAPTCHA challenges with 998 accuracy 82 In 2015 Shuman Ghosemajumder former click fraud czar of Google stated that there were cybercriminal sites that would defeat CAPTCHA challenges for a fee to enable various forms of fraud 83 Subject matter expert Turing test edit Main article Subject matter expert Turing test Another variation is described as the subject matter expert Turing test where a machines response cannot be distinguished from an expert in a given field This is also known as a Feigenbaum test and was proposed by Edward Feigenbaum in a 2003 paper 84 Total Turing test edit The Total Turing test 48 variation of the Turing test proposed by cognitive scientist Stevan Harnad 85 adds two further requirements to the traditional Turing test The interrogator can also test the perceptual abilities of the subject requiring computer vision and the subjects ability to manipulate objects requiring robotics 86 Electronic health records edit A letter published in Communications of the ACM 87 describes the concept of generating a synthetic patient population and proposes a variation of Turing test to assess the difference between synthetic and real patients The letter states In the EHR context though a human physician can readily distinguish between synthetically generated and real live human patients could a machine be given the intelligence to make such a determination on its own and further the letter states Before synthetic patient identities become a public health problem the legitimate EHR market might benefit from applying Turing Testlike techniques to ensure greater data reliability and diagnostic value Any new techniques must thus consider patients heterogeneity and are likely to have greater complexity than the Allen eighthgradesciencetest is able to grade Minimum intelligent signal test edit Main article Minimum intelligent signal test The minimum intelligent signal test was proposed by Chris McKinstry as the maximum abstraction of the Turing test 88 in which only binary responses truefalse or yesno are permitted to focus only on the capacity for thought It eliminates text chat problems like anthropomorphism bias and does not require emulation of unintelligent human behaviour allowing for systems that exceed human intelligence The questions must each stand on their own however making it more like an IQ test than an interrogation It is typically used to gather statistical data against which the performance of artificial intelligence programs may be measured 89 Hutter Prize edit The organisers of the Hutter Prize believe that compressing natural language text is a hard AI problem equivalent to passing the Turing test The data compression test has some advantages over most versions and variations of a Turing test including It gives a single number that can be directly used to compare which of two machines is more intelligent It does not require the computer to lie to the judge The main disadvantages of using data compression as a test are It is not possible to test humans this way It is unknown what particular score on this testif anyis equivalent to passing a humanlevel Turing test Other tests based on compression or Kolmogorov complexity edit A related approach to Hutters prize which appeared much earlier in the late 1990s is the inclusion of compression problems in an extended Turing test 90 or by tests which are completely derived from Kolmogorov complexity 91 Other related tests in this line are presented by HernandezOrallo and Dowe 92 Algorithmic IQ or AIQ for short is an attempt to convert the theoretical Universal Intelligence Measure from Legg and Hutter based on Solomonoffs inductive inference into a working practical test of machine intelligence 93 Two major advantages of some of these tests are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers Ebert test edit The Turing test inspired the Ebert test proposed in 2011 by film critic Roger Ebert which is a test whether a computerbased synthesised voice has sufficient skill in terms of intonations inflections timing and so forth to make people laugh 94 Predictions edit Turing predicted that machines would eventually be able to pass the test in fact he estimated that by the year 2000 machines with around 100 MB of storage would be able to fool 30 of human judges in a fiveminute test and that people would no longer consider the phrase thinking machine contradictory 4 In practice from 20092012 the Loebner Prize chatterbot contestants only managed to fool a judge once 95 and that was only due to the human contestant pretending to be a chatbot 96 He further predicted that machine learning would be an important part of building powerful machines a claim considered plausible by contemporary researchers in artificial intelligence 69 In a 2008 paper submitted to 19th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Conference Dr Shane T Mueller predicted a modified Turing test called a Cognitive Decathlon could be accomplished within five years 97 By extrapolating an exponential growth of technology over several decades futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that Turing testcapable computers would be manufactured in the near future In 1990 he set the year around 2020 98 By 2005 he had revised his estimate to 2029 99 The Long Bet Project Bet Nr 1 is a wager of 20000 between Mitch Kapor pessimist and Ray Kurzweil optimist about whether a computer will pass a lengthy Turing test by the year 2029 During the Long Now Turing Test each of three Turing test judges will conduct online interviews of each of the four Turing test candidates ie the computer and the three Turing test human foils for two hours each for a total of eight hours of interviews The bet specifies the conditions in some detail 100 Conferences edit Turing Colloquium edit 1990 marked the fortieth anniversary of the first publication of Turings Computing Machinery and Intelligence paper and saw renewed interest in the test Two significant events occurred in that year The first was the Turing Colloquium which was held at the University of Sussex in April and brought together academics and researchers from a wide variety of disciplines to discuss the Turing test in terms of its past present and future the second was the formation of the annual Loebner Prize competition Blay Whitby lists four major turning points in the history of the Turing test the publication of Computing Machinery and Intelligence in 1950 the announcement of Joseph Weizenbaum s ELIZA in 1966 Kenneth Colby s creation of PARRY which was first described in 1972 and the Turing Colloquium in 1990 101 2005 Colloquium on Conversational Systems edit In November 2005 the University of Surrey hosted an inaugural oneday meeting of artificial conversational entity developers 102 attended by winners of practical Turing tests in the Loebner Prize Robby Garner Richard Wallace and Rollo Carpenter Invited speakers included David Hamill Hugh Loebner sponsor of the Loebner Prize and Huma Shah 2008 AISB Symposium edit In parallel to the 2008 Loebner Prize held at the University of Reading 103 the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour AISB hosted a oneday symposium to discuss the Turing test organised by John Barnden Mark Bishop Huma Shah and Kevin Warwick 104 The speakers included the Royal Institutions Director Baroness Susan Greenfield Selmer Bringsjord Turings biographer Andrew Hodges and consciousness scientist Owen Holland No agreement emerged for a canonical Turing test though Bringsjord expressed that a sizeable prize would result in the Turing test being passed sooner The Alan Turing Year and Turing100 in 2012 edit Throughout 2012 a number of major events took place to celebrate Turings life and scientific impact The Turing100 group supported these events and also organised a special Turing test event in Bletchley Park on 23 June 2012 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of

Imitation Game however later literature has reserved the term Imitation game to describe a particular version of the test See Versions of the Turing test below Turing gives a more precise version of the question later in the paper These questions are equivalent to this Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage suitably increasing its speed of action and providing it with an appropriate programme C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game the part of B being taken by a

Turing began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist and in 1952 lacking a computer powerful enough to execute the program played a game in which he simulated it taking about half an hour over each move The game was recorded and the program lost to Turings colleague Alick Glennie although it is said that it won a game against Champernownes wife Turing 1948 p pageneeded
