Stanford University 1966 Arthur Lee Samuel December 5 1901 July 29 1990 3 was an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence 1 He popularized the term machine learning in 1959 4 The Samuel Checkersplaying Program was among the worlds first successful selflearning programs and as such a very early demonstration of the fundamental concept of artificial intelligence AI 5 He was also a senior member in the TeX community who devoted much time giving personal attention to the needs of users and wrote an early TeX manual in 1983 6 Contents 1 Biography 2 Computer

Kansas in 1923 3 He received a masters degree in Electrical Engineering from MIT in 1926 and taught for two years as instructor In 1928 he joined Bell Laboratories where he worked mostly on vacuum tubes including improvements of radar during World War II 5 He developed a gasdischarge transmitreceive switch TR tube that allowed a single antenna to be used for both transmitting and receiving 7 After the war he moved to the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign where he initiated the ILLIAC project but left before its first computer was completeSamuel went to IBM in Poughkeepsie New York in 1949 where he would conceive and carry out his most successful work He is credited with one of the first software hash tables and influencing early research in using transistors for computers at IBM 3 At IBM he made the first checkers program on IBMs first commercial computer the IBM 701 The program was a sensational demonstration of the advances in both hardware and skilled programming and caused IBMs stock to increase 15 points overnight His pioneering nonnumerical programming helped shape the instruction set of processors as he was one of the first to work with computers on projects other than computation 1 He was known for writing articles that made complex subjects easy to understand He was chosen to write an introduction to one of the earliest journals devoted to computing in 1953 8 In 1966 Samuel retired from IBM and became a professor at Stanford where he worked the remainder of his life He worked with Donald Knuth on the TeX project including writing some of the documentation He continued to write software past his 88th birthday 6 He was given the Computer Pioneer Award by the IEEE Computer Society in 1987 9 He died of complications from Parkinsons disease on July 29 1990 5 Computer checkers draughts development edit Samuel is most known within the AI community for his groundbreaking work in computer checkers in 1959 and seminal research on machine learning beginning in 1949 6 He graduated from MIT and taught at MIT and UIUC from 1946 to 1949 10 He believed teaching computers to play games was very fruitful for developing tactics appropriate to general problems and he chose checkers as it is relatively simple though has a depth of strategy The main driver of the machine was a search tree of the board positions reachable from the current state Since he had only a very limited amount of available computer memory Samuel implemented what is now called alphabeta pruning 11 Instead of searching each path until it came to the games conclusion Samuel developed a scoring function based on the position of the board at any given time This function tried to measure the chance of winning for each side at the given position It took into account such things as the number of pieces on each side the number of kings and the proximity of pieces to being kinged The program chose its move based on a minimax strategy meaning it made the move that optimized the value of this function assuming that the opponent was trying to optimize the value of the same function from its point of view 12 Samuel also designed various mechanisms by which his program could become better In what he called rote learning the program remembered every position it had already seen along with the terminal value of the reward function This technique effectively extended the search depth at each of these positions Samuels later programs reevaluated the reward function based on input from professional games He also had it play thousands of games against itself as another way of learning With all of this work Samuels program reached a respectable amateur status and was the first to play any board game at this high a level He continued to work on checkers until the mid1970s at which point his program achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur 13 Awards edit 1987 Computer Pioneer Award 2 For Adaptive nonnumeric processing
