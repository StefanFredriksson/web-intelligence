any body of knowledge 17 29 In this sense philosophy is closely related to religion mathematics natural science education and politics Newtons 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy is classified in the 2000s as a book of physics he used the term natural philosophy because it used to encompass disciplines that later became associated with sciences such as astronomy medicine and physics 18 In the first part of the first book of his Academics Cicero introduced the division of philosophy into logic physics and ethics He was copying Epicurus division of his doctrine into canon physics and ethics In section thirteen of the first book of his Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers the 3rdcentury Diogenes Laërtius the first historian of philosophy established the traditional division of philosophical inquiry into three parts Natural philosophy physics from ta physika things having to do with nature physis was the study of the constitution and processes of transformation in the physical world Moral philosophy ethics from êthika literally having to do with character disposition manners was the study of goodness right and wrong justice and virtue Metaphysical philosophy logic was the study of existence causation God logic forms and other abstract objects meta ta physika lit After the book the Physics 30 This division is not obsolete but has changed Natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences especially astronomy physics chemistry biology and cosmology Moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences but still includes value theory including aesthetics ethics political philosophy etc Metaphysical philosophy has birthed formal sciences such as logic mathematics and philosophy of science but still includes epistemology cosmology and others Philosophical progress Many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today Colin McGinn and others claim that no philosophical progress has occurred during that interval 31 Chalmers and others by contrast see progress in philosophy similar to that in science 32 while Talbot Brewer argued that progress is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity 33 Historical overview In one general sense philosophy is associated with wisdom intellectual culture and a search for knowledge In that sense all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions such as how are we to live and what is the nature of reality A broad and impartial conception of philosophy then finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as reality morality and life in all world civilizations 34 Western philosophy Main article Western philosophy Bust of Socrates in the Vatican Museum Statue of Aristotle in the Aristotlepark of Stagira Western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world and dates to PreSocratic thinkers who were active in Ancient Greece in the 6th century BCE such as Thales c 624546 BCE and Pythagoras c 570495 BCE who practiced a love of wisdom philosophia 35 and were also termed physiologoi students of physis or nature Socrates was a very influential philosopher who insisted that he possessed no wisdom but was a pursuer of wisdom 36 Western philosophy can be divided into three eras ancient GrecoRoman medieval philosophy Christian European and modern philosophy The ancient era was dominated by Greek philosophical schools which arose out of the various pupils of Socrates such as Plato who founded the Platonic Academy and his student Aristotle 37 founding the Peripatetic school who were both extremely influential in Western tradition Other traditions include Cynicism Stoicism Skepticism and Epicureanism Important topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics with competing theories such as atomism and monism cosmology the nature of the welllived life eudaimonia the possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason logos With the rise of the Roman empire Greek philosophy was also increasingly discussed in Latin by Romans such as Cicero and Seneca see Roman philosophy Medieval philosophy 5th16th centuries is the period following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and was dominated by the rise of Christianity and hence reflects JudeoChristian theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with GrecoRoman thought Problems such as the existence and nature of God the nature of faith and reason metaphysics the problem of evil were discussed in this period Some key Medieval thinkers include St Augustine Thomas Aquinas Boethius Anselm and Roger Bacon Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to Theology ancilla theologiae and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture This period saw the development of Scholasticism a text critical method developed in medieval universities based on close reading and disputation on key texts The Renaissance period saw increasing focus on classic GrecoRoman thought and on a robust Humanism Early modern philosophy in the Western world begins with thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes 15961650 38 Following the rise of natural science modern philosophy was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion scholastic thought and the Church Major modern philosophers include Spinoza Leibniz Locke Berkeley Hume and Kant 39 40 41 19thcentury philosophy late modern philosophy is influenced by the wider movement termed the Enlightenment and includes figures such as Hegel a key figure in German idealism Kierkegaard who developed the foundations for existentialism Nietzsche a famed antiChristian John Stuart Mill who promoted utilitarianism Karl Marx who developed the foundations for communism and the American William James The 20th century saw the split between analytic philosophy and continental philosophy as well as philosophical trends such as phenomenology existentialism logical positivism pragmatism and the linguistic turn see Contemporary philosophy Middle Eastern philosophy Avicenna Portrait on Silver Vase Iran See also Islamic philosophy and Middle Eastern philosophy The regions of the fertile Crescent Iran and Arabia are home to the earliest known philosophical Wisdom literature and is today mostly dominated by Islamic culture Early wisdom literature from the fertile crescent was a genre which sought to instruct people on ethical action practical living and virtue through stories and proverbs In Ancient Egypt these texts were known as sebayt teachings and they are central to our understandings of Ancient Egyptian philosophy Babylonian astronomy also included much philosophical speculations about cosmology which may have influenced the Ancient Greeks Jewish philosophy and Christian philosophy are religiophilosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe which both share certain early Judaic texts mainly the Tanakh and monotheistic beliefs Jewish thinkers such as the Geonim of the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia and Maimonides engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophy Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of Moses Mendelssohn who ushered in the Haskalah the Jewish Enlightenment Jewish existentialism and Reform Judaism PreIslamic Iranian philosophy begins with the work of Zoroaster one of the first promoters of monotheism and of the dualism between good and evil This dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as Manichaeism Mazdakism and Zurvanism After the Muslim conquests Early Islamic philosophy developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions This Islamic Golden Age influenced European intellectual developments The two main currents of early Islamic thought are Kalam which focuses on Islamic theology and Falsafa which was based on Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism The work of Aristotle was very influential among the falsafa such as alKindi 9th century Avicenna 980 June 1037 and Averroes 12th century Others such as AlGhazali were highly critical of the methods of the Aristotelian falsafa Islamic thinkers also developed a scientific method experimental medicine a theory of optics and a legal philosophy Ibn Khaldun was an influential thinker in philosophy of history In Iran several schools of Islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the Golden Age and include currents such as Illuminationist philosophy Sufi philosophy and Transcendent theosophy The 19th and 20thcentury Arab world saw the Nahda awakening or renaissance movement which influenced contemporary Islamic philosophy Indian philosophy Main articles Eastern philosophy and Indian philosophy Indian philosophy Sanskrit darśana world views teachings 42 refers to the diverse philosophical traditions that emerged since the ancient times on the Indian subcontinent Jainism and Buddhism originated at the end of the Vedic period while Hinduism emerged as a fusion of diverse traditions starting after the end of the Vedic period Hindus generally classify these traditions as either orthodox or heterodox āstika or nāstika depending on whether they accept the authority of the Vedas and the theories of Brahman and Atman soul self therein 43 44 The orthodox schools include the Hindu traditions of thought while the heterodox schools include the Buddhist and the Jain traditions 45 Other schools include the Ajñana Ajivika and Cārvāka which became extinct over their history 46 47 Important Indian philosophical concepts shared by the Indian philosophies include dharma karma artha kama dukkha suffering anitya anicca impermanence dhyana jhana meditation renunciation with or without monasticism or asceticism various samsara with cycles of rebirth moksha nirvana kaivalya liberation from rebirth and virtues such as ahimsa 48 49 Jain philosophy Akalanka Main article Jain philosophy Jain philosophy accepts the concept of a permanent soul jiva as one of the five astikayas or eternal infinite categories that make up the substance of existence The other four being dharma adharma akasha space and pudgala matter The Jain thought separates matter from the soul completely 50 It has two major subtraditions Digambara sky dressed naked and Svetambara white dressed along with several more minor traditions such as Terapanthis 51 Asceticism is a major monastic virtue in Jainism 52 Jain texts such as the Tattvartha Sutra state that right faith right knowledge and right conduct is the path to liberation 53 The Jain thought holds that all existence is cyclic eternal and uncreated 54 55 The Tattvartha Sutra is the earliest known most comprehensive and authoritative compilation of Jain philosophy 56 57 Buddhist philosophy Play media Monks debating at Sera monastery Tibet 2013 According to Jan Westerhoff public debates constituted the most important and most visible forms of philosophical exchange in ancient Indian intellectual life 58 Buddhist philosophy begins with the thought of Gautama Buddha fl between sixth and fourth centuries BCE and is preserved in the early Buddhist texts It originated in India and later spread to East Asia Tibet Central Asia and Southeast Asia developing various traditions in these regions Mahayana forms are the dominant Buddhist philosophical traditions in East Asian regions such as China Korea and Japan The Theravada forms are dominant in Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka Burma and Thailand Because ignorance to the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering dukkha Buddhist philosophy is concerned with epistemology metaphysics ethics and psychology Buddhist philosophical texts must also be understood within the context of meditative practices which are supposed to bring about certain cognitive shifts 59 Key innovative concepts include the four noble truths as an analysis of suffering anicca impermanence and anatta notself 60 61 After the death of the Buddha various groups began to systematize his main teachings eventually developing comprehensive philosophical systems termed Abhidharma 62 Following the Abhidharma schools Mahayana philosophers such as Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu developed the theories of shunyata emptiness of all phenomena and vijñaptimatra appearance only a form of phenomenology or transcendental idealism The Dignāga school of pramāṇa lit means of knowledge promoted a sophisticated form of Buddhist logicoepistemology There were numerous schools subschools and traditions of Buddhist philosophy in India According to Oxford professor of Buddhist philosophy Jan Westerhoff the major Indian schools from 300 BCE to 1000 CE were 63 The Mahāsāṃghika tradition The Sthavira schools which include Sarvāstivāda Sautrāntika Vibhajyavāda later known as Theravada in Sri Lanka and Pudgalavāda The Mahayana schools mainly the Madhyamaka Yogachara Tathāgatagarbha and Tantra After the disappearance of Buddhism from India some of these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the Tibetan Buddhist East Asian Buddhist and Theravada Buddhist traditions citation needed Hindu philosophies Main article Hindu philosophy Adi Shankara is one of the much studied Hindu philosophers 64 65 The Vedasbased orthodox schools are a part of the Hindu traditions and they are traditionally classified into six darsanas Nyaya Vaisheshika Samkhya Yoga Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta 66 67 The Vedas as a knowledge source were interpreted differently by these six schools of Hindu philosophy with varying degrees of overlap They represent a collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection according to Chadha 68 They also reflect a tolerance for a diversity of philosophical interpretations within Hinduism while sharing the same foundation 69 Some of the earliest surviving Hindu mystical and philosophical texts are the Upanishads of the later Vedic period 1000500 BCE Hindu philosophers of the six schools developed systems of epistemology pramana and investigated topics such as metaphysics ethics psychology guna hermeneutics and soteriology within the framework of the Vedic knowledge while presenting a diverse collection of interpretations 70 71 72 These schools of philosophy accepted the Vedas and the Vedic concept of Atman and Brahman 67 differed from the following Indian religions that rejected the authority of the Vedas 47 Cārvāka a materialism school that accepted the existence of free will 73 74 Ājīvika a materialism school that denied the existence of free will 75 76 Buddhism a philosophy that denies the existence of ātman unchanging soul Self 77 and is based on the teachings and enlightenment of Gautama Buddha Jainism a philosophy that accepts the existence of the ātman soul Self but is based on the teachings of twentyfour ascetic teachers known as tirthankaras with Rishabha as the first and Mahavira as the twentyfourth 78 The commonly named six orthodox schools over time led to what has been called the Hindu synthesis as exemplified by its scripture the Bhagavad Gita 79 80 81 East Asian philosophy Main articles Chinese philosophy Korean philosophy and Japanese philosophy The Analects of Confucius fl 551479 BCE Kitarō Nishida professor of philosophy at Kyoto University and founder of the Kyoto School East Asian philosophical thought began in Ancient China and Chinese philosophy begins during the Western Zhou Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the Hundred Schools of Thought flourished 6th century to 221 BCE 82 83 This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major philosophical schools of China Confucianism Legalism and Daoism as well as numerous other less influential schools These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical political and ethical theories such Tao Yin and yang Ren and Li which along with Chinese Buddhism directly influenced Korean philosophy Vietnamese philosophy and Japanese philosophy which also includes the native Shinto tradition Buddhism began arriving in China during the Han Dynasty 206 BCE 220 CE through a gradual Silk road transmission and through native influences developed distinct Chinese forms such as Chan Zen which spread throughout the East Asian cultural sphere During later Chinese dynasties like the Ming Dynasty 13681644 as well as in the Korean Joseon dynasty 13921897 a resurgent NeoConfucianism led by thinkers such as Wang Yangming 14721529 became the dominant school of thought and was promoted by the imperial state In the Modern era Chinese thinkers incorporated ideas from Western philosophy Chinese Marxist philosophy developed under the influence of Mao Zedong while a Chinese pragmatism under Hu Shih and New Confucianism s rise was influenced by Xiong Shili Modern Japanese thought meanwhile developed under strong Western influences such as the study of Western Sciences Rangaku and the modernist Meirokusha intellectual society which drew from European enlightenment thought The 20th century saw the rise of State Shinto and also Japanese nationalism The Kyoto School an influential and unique Japanese philosophical school developed from Western phenomenology and Medieval Japanese Buddhist philosophy such as that of Dogen African philosophy Main article African philosophy African philosophy is philosophy produced by African people philosophy that presents African worldviews ideas and themes or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods Modern African thought has been occupied with Ethnophilosophy with defining the very meaning of African philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be African 84 During the 17th century Ethiopian philosophy developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by Zera Yacob Another early African philosopher was Anton Wilhelm Amo c 17031759 who became a respected philosopher in Germany Distinct African philosophical ideas include Ujamaa the Bantu idea of Force Négritude PanAfricanism and Ubuntu Contemporary African thought has also seen the development of Professional philosophy and of Africana philosophy the philosophical literature of the African diaspora which includes currents such as black existentialism by AfricanAmericans Modern African thinkers have been influenced by Marxism AfricanAmerican literature Critical theory Critical race theory Postcolonialism and Feminism Indigenous American philosophy Main article Indigenous American philosophy The Aztec Sun Stone also known as the Aztec Calendar Stone at National Museum of Anthropology Mexico City Indigenous American philosophy is the philosophy of the Indigenous people of the Americas There is a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among these different American cultures Among some of the Native Americans in the United States there is a belief in a metaphysical principle called the Great Mystery Siouan Wakan Tanka Algonquian Gitche Manitou Another widely shared concept was that of Orenda or spiritual power According to Peter M Whiteley for the Native Americans Mind is critically informed by transcendental experience dreams visions and so on as well as by reason 85 The practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed Shamanism Another feature of the indigenous American worldviews was their extension of ethics to nonhuman animals and plants 85 86 In Mesoamerica Aztec philosophy was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called Tlamatini those who know something 87 and its ideas are preserved in various Aztec codices The Aztec worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called Ometeotl which can be translated as Dual Cosmic Energy and sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing slippery world The theory of Teotl can be seen as a form of Pantheism 88 Aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics epistemology values and aesthetics Aztec ethics was focused on seeking tlamatiliztli knowledge wisdom which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the Nahua proverb the middle good is necessary 88 The Inca civilization also had an elite class of philosopherscholars termed the Amawtakuna who were important in the Inca education system as teachers of religion tradition history and ethics Key concepts of Andean thought are Yanantin and Masintin which involve a theory of complementary opposites that sees polarities such as malefemale darklight as interdependent parts of a harmonious whole 89 Categories Philosophical questions can be grouped into categories These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions The groupings also make philosophy easier for students to approach Students can learn the basic principles involved in one aspect of the field without being overwhelmed with the entire set of philosophical theories Various sources present different categorical schemes The categories adopted in this article aim for breadth and simplicity These five major branches can be separated into subbranches and each subbranch contains many specific fields of study 90 Metaphysics and epistemology Value theory Science logic and mathematics History of Western philosophy 91 Philosophical traditions These divisions are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive A philosopher might specialize in Kantian epistemology or Platonic aesthetics or modern political philosophy Furthermore these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science religion or mathematics 92 Metaphysics Main article Metaphysics Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality such as existence time objects and their properties wholes and their parts events processes and causation and the relationship between mind and body Metaphysics includes cosmology the study of the world in its entirety and ontology the study of being A major point of debate is between realism which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception and idealism which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial Metaphysics deals with the topic of identity Essence is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while accident is a property that the object has without which the object can still retain its identity Particulars are objects that are said to exist in space and time as opposed to abstract objects such as numbers and universals which are properties held by multiple particulars such as redness or a gender The type of existence if any of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate Epistemology Main article Epistemology Dignaga founded a school of Buddhist epistemology and logic Epistemology is the study of knowledge Greek episteme 93 Epistemologists study the putative sources of knowledge including intuition a priori reason memory perceptual knowledge selfknowledge and testimony They also ask What is truth Is knowledge justified true belief Are any beliefs justified Putative knowledge includes propositional knowledge knowledge that something is the case knowhow knowledge of how to do something and acquaintance familiarity with someone or something Epistemologists examine these and ask whether knowledge is really possible Skepticism is the position which doubts claims to knowledge The regress argument a fundamental problem in epistemology occurs when in order to completely prove any statement its justification itself needs to be supported by another justification This chain can go on forever called infinitism it can eventually rely on basic beliefs that are left unproven called foundationalism or it can go in a circle so that a statement is included in its own chain of justification called coherentism Rationalism is the emphasis on reasoning as a source of knowledge It is associated with a priori knowledge which is independent of experience such as math and logical deduction Empiricism is the emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge Among the numerous topics within metaphysics and epistemology broadly construed are Philosophy of language explores the nature the origins and the use of language Philosophy of mind explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body It is typified by disputes between dualism and materialism In recent years this branch has become related to cognitive science Philosophy of human nature analyzes the unique characteristics of human beings such as rationality politics and culture Metaphilosophy explores the aims of philosophy its boundaries and its methods Value theory Value theory or axiology is the major branch of philosophy that addresses topics such as goodness beauty and justice Value theory includes ethics aesthetics political philosophy feminist philosophy philosophy of law and more Ethics Main article Ethics The Beijing imperial college was an intellectual center for Confucian ethics and classics during the Yuan Ming and Qing dynasties Ethics or moral philosophy studies and considers what is good and bad conduct right and wrong values and good and evil Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of morality It also includes metainvestigations about whether a best way to live or related standards exists The main branches of ethics are normative ethics metaethics and applied ethics A major area of debate involves consequentialism in which actions are judged by the potential results of the act such as to maximize happiness called utilitarianism and deontology in which actions are judged by how they adhere to principles irrespective of negative ends Aesthetics Main article Aesthetics Aesthetics is the critical reflection on art culture and nature 94 95 It addresses the nature of art beauty and taste enjoyment emotional values perception and with the creation and appreciation of beauty 96 97 It is more precisely defined as the study of sensory or sensoriemotional values sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste 98 Its major divisions are art theory literary theory film theory and music theory An example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the Cubist aesthetic 99 The philosophy of film analyzes films and filmmakers for their philosophical content and explores film images cinema etc as a medium for philosophical reflection and expression citation needed Political philosophy Main article Political philosophy Thomas Hobbes Political philosophy is the study of government and the relationship of individuals or families and clans to communities including the state It includes questions about justice law property and the rights and obligations of the citizen Politics and ethics are traditionally linked subjects as both discuss the question of how people should live together Other branches of value theory Philosophy of law often called jurisprudence explores the varying theories explaining the nature and interpretation of laws Philosophy of education analyzes the definition and content of education as well as the goals and challenges of educators Feminist philosophy explores questions surrounding gender sexuality and the body including the nature of feminism itself as a social and philosophical movement Philosophy of sport analyzes sports games and other forms of play as sociological and uniquely human activities Logic science and mathematics Many academic disciplines generated philosophical inquiry The relationship between X and the philosophy of X is debated Richard Feynman argued that the philosophy of a topic is irrelevant to its primary study saying that philosophy of science is as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds Curtis White by contrast argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities sciences and social sciences 100 The topics of philosophy of science are numbers symbols and the formal methods of reasoning as employed in the social sciences and natural sciences Logic Main article Logic Logic is the study of reasoning and argument An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition The connected series of statements are premises and the proposition is the conclusion For example All humans are mortal premise Socrates is a human premise Therefore Socrates is mortal conclusion Deductive reasoning is when given certain premises conclusions are unavoidably implied Rules of inference are used to infer conclusions such as modus ponens where given A and If A then B then B must be concluded Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences 101 social sciences and humanities disciplines logic became a formal science Subfields include mathematical logic philosophical logic Modal logic computational logic and nonclassical logics A major question in the philosophy of mathematics is whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered called mathematical realism or invented called mathematical antirealism Philosophy of science Main article Philosophy of science This branch explores the foundations methods history implications and purpose of science Many of its subdivisions correspond to a specific branch of science For example philosophy of biology deals specifically with the metaphysical epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences The philosophy of mathematics studies the philosophical assumptions foundations and implications of mathematics History of philosophy See also Metaphilosophy and History of ethics Further information Philosophical progress and List of years in philosophy Some philosophers specialize in one or more historical periods The history of philosophy study of a specific period individual or school is related to but not the same as the philosophy of history the theoretical aspect of history which deals with questions such as the nature of historical evidence and the possibility of objectivity Hegels Lectures on the Philosophy of History influenced many philosophers to interpret truth in light of history a view called historicism Philosophy of religion Main article Philosophy of religion Philosophy of religion deals with questions that involve religion and religious ideas from a philosophically neutral perspective as opposed to theology which begins from religious convictions 102 Traditionally religious questions were not seen as a separate field from philosophy proper the idea of a separate field only arose in the 19th century 103 Issues include the existence of God the relationship between reason and faith questions of religious epistemology the relationship between religion and science how to interpret religious experiences questions about the possibility of an afterlife the problem of religious language and the existence of souls and responses to religious pluralism and diversity Philosophical schools Some philosophers specialize in one or more of the major philosophical schools such as Continental philosophy Analytical philosophy Thomism Asian philosophy or African philosophy Other approaches A variety of other academic and nonacademic approaches have been explored Applied philosophy Martin Luther King Jr The ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs Weaver argued that ideas have consequences Philosophy yields applications such as those in ethics applied ethics in particular and political philosophy The political and economic philosophies of Confucius Sun Tzu Chanakya Ibn Khaldun Ibn Rushd Ibn Taymiyyah Machiavelli Leibniz Hobbes Locke Rousseau Adam Smith John Stuart Mill Marx Tolstoy Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions Progressive education as championed by Dewey had a profound impact on 20thcentury US educational practices Descendants of this movement include efforts in philosophy for children which are part of philosophy education Clausewitz s political philosophy of war has had a profound effect on statecraft international politics and military strategy in the 20th century especially around World War II Logic is important in mathematics linguistics psychology computer science and computer engineering Other important applications can be found in epistemology which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge sound evidence and justified belief important in law economics decision theory and a number of other disciplines The philosophy of science discusses the underpinnings of the scientific method and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation Philosophy thus has fundamental implications for science as a whole For example the strictly empirical approach of BF Skinner s behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment Deep ecology and animal rights examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has nonhuman occupants to consider also Aesthetics can help to interpret discussions of music literature the plastic arts and the whole artistic dimension of life In general the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields Society Some of those who study philosophy become professional philosophers typically by working as professors who teach research and write in academic institutions 104 However most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law journalism religion sciences politics business or various arts 105 106 For example public figures who have degrees in philosophy include comedians Steve Martin and Ricky Gervais filmmaker Terrence Malick Pope John Paul II Wikipedia cofounder Larry Sanger technology entrepreneur Peter Thiel Supreme Court Justice Stephen Bryer and vice presidential candidate Carly Fiorina 107 108 Recent efforts to avail the general public to the work and relevance of philosophers include the milliondollar Berggruen Prize first awarded to Charles Taylor in 2016 109 Professional Germany was the first country to professionalize philosophy The doctorate of philosophy PhD developed in Germany as the terminal Teachers credential in the mid 17th century 110 At the end of 1817 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was the first philosopher to be appointed Professor by the State namely by the Prussian Minister of Education as an effect of Napoleonic reform in Prussia In the United States the professionalization grew out of reforms to the American highereducation system largely based on the German model Bertrand Russell Within the last century philosophy has increasingly become a professional discipline practiced within universities like other academic disciplines Accordingly it has become less general and more specialized In the view of one prominent recent historian Philosophy has become a highly organized discipline done by specialists primarily for other specialists The number of philosophers has exploded the volume of publication has swelled and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied Not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields 111 Some philosophers argue that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline 112 The end result of professionalization for philosophy has meant that work being done in the field is now almost exclusively done by university professors holding a doctorate in the field publishing in highly technical peerreviewed journals While it remains common among the population at large for a person to have a set of religious political or philosophical views that they consider their philosophy these views are rarely informed by or connected to the work being done in professional philosophy today Furthermore unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books magazines and television shows meant to popularize science and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare Philosopher Michael Sandel s book Justice Whats the Right Thing to Do and Harry Frankfurt s On Bullshit are examples of works that hold the uncommon distinction of having been written by professional philosophers but directed at and ultimately popular among a broader audience of nonphilosophers Both works became New York Times best sellers Nonprofessional Main article Contemporary philosophy Outside the profession Many inquiries outside of academia are philosophical in the broad sense Novelists playwrights filmmakers and musicians as well as scientists and others engage in recognizably philosophical activity Role of women Main article Women in philosophy American philosopher of mind and philosopher of art Susanne Langer 18951985 Although men have generally dominated philosophical discourse women have engaged in philosophy throughout history Women philosophers have contributed since ancient timesnotably Hipparchia of Maroneia active c 325 BCE and Arete of Cyrene active 5th4th centuries BCE More were accepted during the ancient medieval and modern eras but no women philosophers became part the Western canon until the 20th and 21st century when some sources indicate that Susanne Langer GEM Anscombe Hannah Arendt and Simone de Beauvoir entered the canon 113 114 115 In the early 1800s some colleges and universities in the UK and US began admitting women producing more female academics Nevertheless US Department of Education reports from the 1990s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy and that philosophy is one of the least genderproportionate fields in the humanities 116 In 2014 Inside Higher Education described the philosophy disciplines own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment of women students and professors Women make up as little as 17 of philosophy faculty in some studies 117 See also Main article Outline of philosophy Philosophy portal List of important publications in philosophy List

practice p 666 Philosophy is rationally critical thinking of a more or less systematic kind about the general nature of the world metaphysics or theory of existence the justification of belief epistemology or theory of knowledge and the conduct of life ethics or theory of value Each of the three elements in this list has a nonphilosophical counterpart from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs their own or those of others with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends Ethics or moral philosophy in its most inclusive sense seeks to articulate in rationally systematic form the rules or principles involved in Honderich

Seven Thinkers and How They Grew Descartes Spinoza Leibniz Locke Berkeley Hume Kant in Rorty Schneewind and Skinner eds Philosophy in History Cambridge University Press 1984 p 125 Literary philosophical and historical studies often rely on a notion of what is canonical In American philosophy scholars go from Jonathan Edwards to John Dewey in American literature from James Fenimore Cooper to F Scott Fitzgerald in political theory from Plato to Hobbes and Locke The texts or authors who fill in the blanks from A to Z in these and other intellectual traditions constitute the canon and there is an accompanying narrative that links text to text or author to author a history of American literature economic thought and so on The most conventional of such histories are embodied in university courses and the textbooks that accompany them This essay examines one such course the History of Modern Philosophy and the texts that helped to create it If a philosopher in the United States were asked why the seven people in my title comprise Modern Philosophy the initial response would be they were the best and there are historical and philosophical connections among them

of Indian philosophical systems its six divisions do not appear to most scholars in this field to stem from logic As a systematic attempt to deal with theoretical problems of metaphysics logic epistemology and related topics the six systems account has several glaring deficiencies Two of these will be mentioned briefly A second deficiency in the sixsystem account is that it only covers

denial that a human being possesses a self or soul is probably the most famous Buddhist teaching It is certainly its most distinct as has been pointed out by GP Malalasekera In its denial of any real permanent Soul or Self Buddhism stands alone A similar modern Sinhalese perspective has been expressed by Walpola Rahula Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence of such a Soul Self or Ātman The no Self or no soul doctrine Sanskrit anātman Pāli anattan is particularly notable for its widespread acceptance and historical endurance It was a standard belief of virtually all the ancient schools of Indian Buddhism the notable exception being the Pudgalavādins and has persisted without change into the modern era both views are mirrored by the modern Theravādin perspective of Mahasi Sayadaw that there is no person or soul and the modern Mahāyāna view of the fourteenth Dalai Lama that the Buddha taught that our belief in an independent self is the root cause
