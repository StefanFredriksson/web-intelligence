biographical information known about him is contained in his famed Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices 12 Like his father before him he served as chief engineer at the Artuklu Palace the residence of the Mardin branch of the Artuqids which ruled across eastern Anatolia as vassals of the Zengid dynasty of Mosul and later of Ayyubid general Saladin 13 AlJazari was part of a tradition of artisans and was thus more a practical engineer than an inventor 14 who appears to have been more interested in the craftsmanship necessary to construct the devices than in the technology which lay behind them and his machines were usually assembled by trial and error rather than by theoretical calculation 15 His Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices appears to have been quite popular as it appears in a large number of manuscript copies and as he explains repeatedly he only describes devices he has built himself According to Mayr the books style resembles that of a modern doityourself book 16 Some of his devices were inspired by earlier devices such as one of his monumental water clocks which was based on that of a PseudoArchimedes 17 He also cites the influence of the Banū Mūsā brothers for his fountains alSaghani for the design of a candle clock and Hibatullah ibn alHusayn d 1139 for musical automata AlJazari goes on to describe the improvements he made to the work of his predecessors and describes a number of devices techniques and components that are original innovations which do not appear in the works by his precessors 18 Mechanisms and methods edit The most significant aspect of alJazaris machines are the mechanisms components ideas methods and design features which they employ 13 Camshaft edit A camshaft a shaft to which cams are attached was introduced in 1206 by alJazari who employed them in his automata 19 water clocks such as the candle clock 20 and waterraising machines 19 The cam and camshaft also appeared in European mechanisms from the 14th century 21 Crankshaft and crankslider mechanism edit The eccentrically mounted handle of the rotary quernstone in fifth century BCE Spain that spread across the Roman Empire constitutes a crank 22 The earliest evidence of a crank and connecting rod mechanism dates to the 3rd century AD Hierapolis sawmill in the Roman Empire 22 The crank also appears in the mid9th century in several of the hydraulic devices described by the Banū Mūsā brothers in their Book of Ingenious Devices 23 In 1206 alJazari invented an early crankshaft 24 25 which he incorporated with a crankconnecting rod mechanism in his twincylinder pump 26 Like the modern crankshaft alJazaris mechanism consisted of a wheel setting several crankpins into motion with the wheels motion being circular and the pins moving backandforth in a straight line 24 The crankshaft described by alJazari 24 25 transforms continuous rotary motion into a linear reciprocating motion 26 and is central to modern machinery such as the steam engine internal combustion engine and automatic controls 25 27 He used the crankshaft with a connecting rod in two of his waterraising machines the crankdriven saqiya chain pump and the doubleaction reciprocating piston suction pump 26 28 His water pump also employed the first known crankslider mechanism 29 Design and construction methods edit English technology historian Donald Hill writes mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 We see for the first time in alJazaris work several concepts important for both design and construction the lamination of timber to minimize warping the static balancing of wheels the use of wooden templates a kind of pattern the use of paper models to establish designs the calibration of orifices the grinding of the seats and plugs of valves together with emery powder to obtain a watertight fit and the casting of metals in closed mold boxes with sand 13 Escapement mechanism in a rotating wheel edit AlJazari invented a method for controlling the speed of rotation of a wheel using an escapement mechanism 30 Mechanical controls edit According to Donald Hill alJazari described several early mechanical controls including a large metal door a combination lock and a lock with four bolts 13 Segmental gear edit A segmental gear is a piece for receiving or communicating reciprocating motion from or to a cogwheel consisting of a sector of a circular gear or ring having cogs on the periphery or face 31 Professor Lynn Townsend White Jr wrote Segmental gears first clearly appear in alJazari in the West they emerge in Giovanni de Dondi s astronomical clock finished in 1364 and only with the great Sienese engineer Francesco di Giorgio 1501 did they enter the general vocabulary of European machine design 32 Waterraising machines edit alJazaris hydropowered saqiya chain pump device AlJazari invented five machines for raising water 1 as well as watermills and water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata 33 in the 12th and 13th centuries and described them in 1206 It was in these waterraising machines that he introduced his most important ideas and components Saqiya chain pumps edit The first known use of a crankshaft in a chain pump was in one of alJazaris saqiya machines The concept of minimizing intermittent working is also first implied in one of alJazaris saqiya chain pumps which was for the purpose of maximising the efficiency of the saqiya chain pump AlJazari also constructed a waterraising saqiya chain pump which was run by hydropower rather than manual labour though the Chinese were also using hydropower for chain pumps prior to him Saqiya machines like the ones he described have been supplying water in Damascus since the 13th century up until modern times 34 and were in everyday use throughout the medieval Islamic world 35 Doubleaction suction pump with valves and reciprocating piston motion edit Citing the Byzantine siphon used for discharging Greek fire as an inspiration 36 alJazari went on to describe the first suction pipes suction pump doubleaction pump and made early uses of valves and a crankshaft connecting rod mechanism when he invented a twincylinder reciprocating piston suction pump This pump is driven by a water wheel which drives through a system of gears an oscillating slotrod to which the rods of two pistons are attached The pistons work in horizontally opposed cylinders each provided with valveoperated suction and delivery pipes The delivery pipes are joined above the centre of the machine to form a single outlet into the irrigation system This waterraising machine had a direct significance for the development of modern engineering This pump is remarkable for three reasons 13 37 38 39 The first known use of a true suction pipe which sucks fluids into a partial vacuum in a pump The first application of the doubleacting principle The conversion of rotary to reciprocating motion via the crankconnecting rod mechanism AlJazaris suction piston pump could lift 136 metres of water citation needed with the help of delivery pipes This was more advanced than the suction pumps that appeared in 15thcentury Europe which lacked delivery pipes It was not however any more efficient than the noria commonly used by the Muslim world at the time 40 Water supply system edit alJazari developed the earliest water supply system to be driven by gears and hydropower which was built in 13th century Damascus to supply water to its mosques and Bimaristan hospitals The system had water from a lake turn a scoopwheel and a system of gears which transported jars of water up to a water channel that led to mosques and hospitals in the city 41 Automata edit AlJazari built automated moving peacocks driven by hydropower 42 He also invented the earliest known automatic gates which were driven by hydropower 41 created automatic doors as part of one of his elaborate water clocks 13 and invented water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata 33 According to Encyclopædia Britannica the Italian Renaissance inventor Leonardo da Vinci may have been influenced by the classic automata of alJazari 43 an assumption which has been further researched and confirmed by the artist Marc van den Broek 44 Mark E Rosheim summarizes the advances in robotics made by Muslim engineers especially alJazari as follows Unlike the Greek designs these Arab examples reveal an interest not only in dramatic illusion but in manipulating the environment for human comfort Thus the greatest contribution the Arabs made besides preserving disseminating and building on the work of the Greeks was the concept of practical application This was the key element that was missing in Greek robotic science 45 The Arabs on the other hand displayed an interest in creating humanlike machines for practical purposes but lacked like other preindustrial societies any real impetus to pursue their robotic science 46 Drinkserving waitress edit One of alJazaris humanoid automata was a waitress that could serve water tea or drinks The drink was stored in a tank with a reservoir from where the drink drips into a bucket and after seven minutes into a cup after which the waitress appears out of an automatic door serving the drink 47 Handwashing automaton with flush mechanism edit AlJazari invented a hand washing automaton incorporating a flush mechanism now used in modern flush toilets It features a female humanoid automaton standing by a basin filled with water When the user pulls the lever the water drains and the female automaton refills the basin 48 Peacock fountain with automated servants edit AlJazaris peacock fountain was a more sophisticated hand washing device featuring humanoid automata as servants which offer soap and towels Mark E Rosheim describes it as follows 45 Pulling a plug on the peacocks tail releases water out of the beak as the dirty water from the basin fills the hollow base a float rises and actuates a linkage which makes a servant figure appear from behind a door under the peacock and offer soap When more water is used a second float at a higher level trips and causes the appearance of a second servant figure with a towel Musical robot band edit AlJazaris musical robot band AlJazaris work described fountains and musical automata in which the flow of water alternated from one large tank to another at hourly or halfhourly intervals This operation was achieved through his innovative use of hydraulic switching 13 AlJazari created a musical automaton which was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties Professor Noel Sharkey has argued that it is quite likely that it was an early programmable automata and has produced a possible reconstruction of the mechanism it has a programmable drum machine with pegs cams that bump into little levers that operated the percussion The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around 49 Clocks edit AlJazari constructed a variety of water clocks and candle clocks These included a portable waterpowered scribe clock which was a meter high and half a meter wide reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum in 1976 33 50 AlJazari also invented monumental waterpowered astronomical clocks which displayed moving models of the Sun Moon and stars Candle clocks edit One of alJazaris candle clocks According to Donald Hill alJazari described the most sophisticated candle clocks known to date Hill described one of alJazaris candle clocks as follows 13 The candle whose rate of burning was known bore against the underside of the cap and its wick passed through the hole Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning The bottom of the candle rested in a shallow dish that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight As the candle burned away the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed The automata were operated from the dish at the bottom of the candle No other candle clocks of this sophistication are known AlJazaris candle clock also included a dial to display the time and for the first time employed a bayonet fitting a fastening mechanism still used in modern times 51 Elephant clock edit Main article Elephant clock The elephant clock described by alJazari in 1206 is notable for several innovations It was the first clock in which an automaton reacted after certain intervals of time in this case a humanoid robot striking the cymbal and a mechanical robotic bird chirping and the first water clock to accurately record the passage of the temporal hours to match the uneven length of days throughout the year 52 Automatic castle clock of alJazari 14th century copy Castle clock edit Further information Clock tower AlJazaris largest astronomical clock was the castle clock which was a complex device that was about 11 feet 34m high and had multiple functions besides timekeeping It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar orbits and an innovative feature of the device was a pointer in the shape of the crescent moon which travelled across the top of a gateway moved by a hidden cart and caused automatic doors to open each revealing a mannequin every hour 13 53 Another innovative feature was the ability to reprogram the length of day and night in order to account for their changes throughout the year Another feature of the device was five automata musicians who automatically play music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel 20 Other components of the castle clock included a main reservoir with a float a float chamber and flow regulator plate and valve trough two pulleys crescent disc displaying the zodiac and two falcon automata dropping balls into vases 54 AlJazaris castle clock is considered to be the earliest programmable analog computer 20 Weightdriven water clocks edit AlJazari invented water clocks that were driven by both water and weights These included geared clocks and a portable waterpowered scribe clock which was a meter high and half a meter wide The scribe with his pen was synonymous to the hour hand of a modern clock 33 50 AlJazaris famous waterpowered scribe clock was reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum London in 1976 Miniature paintings edit Alongside his accomplishments as an inventor and engineer alJazari was also an accomplished artist In The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices he gave instructions of his inventions and illustrated them using miniature paintings a medieval style of Islamic art One of alJazaris candle clocks The musical robot band designed by alJazari A table device automaton designed by alJazari The handwashing
