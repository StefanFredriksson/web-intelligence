Swarm intelligence Swarm intelligence SI is the collective behavior of decentralized selforganized systems natural or artificial The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence The expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989 in the context of cellular robotic systems 1 SI systems consist typically of a population of simple agents or boids interacting locally with one another and with their environment The inspiration often comes from nature especially biological systems The agents follow very simple rules and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave local and to a certain degree random interactions between such agents lead to the emergence of intelligent global behavior unknown to the individual agents Examples of swarm intelligence in natural systems include ant colonies bird flocking hawks hunting animal herding bacterial growth fish schooling and microbial intelligence The application of swarm principles to robots is called swarm robotics while swarm intelligence refers to the more general set of algorithms Swarm prediction has been used in the context of forecasting problems Similar approaches to those proposed for swarm robotics are considered for genetically modified organisms in synthetic collective intelligence 2 Contents 1 Models of swarm behavior 11 Boids

Reynolds in 1986 which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds His paper on this topic was published in 1987 in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference 3 The name boid corresponds to a shortened version of birdoid object which refers to a birdlike object 4 As with most artificial life simulations Boids is an example of emergent behavior that is the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents the boids in this case adhering to a set of simple rules The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows separation steer to avoid crowding local flockmates alignment steer towards the average heading of local flockmates cohesion steer to move toward the average position center of mass of local flockmates More complex rules can be added such as obstacle avoidance and goal seeking Selfpropelled particles Vicsek et al 1995 edit Main article Selfpropelled particles Selfpropelled particles SPP also referred to as the Vicsek model was introduced in 1995 by Vicsek et al 5 as a special case of the boids model introduced in 1986 by Reynolds 3 A swarm is modelled in SPP by a collection of particles that move with a constant speed but respond to a random perturbation by adopting at each time increment the average direction of motion of the other particles in their local neighbourhood 6 SPP models predict that swarming animals share certain properties at the group level regardless of the type of animals in the swarm 7 Swarming systems give rise to emergent behaviours which occur at many different scales some of which are turning out to be both universal and robust It has become a challenge in theoretical physics to find minimal statistical models that capture these behaviours 8 9 10 Metaheuristics edit See also List of metaphorbased metaheuristics Evolutionary algorithms EA particle swarm optimization PSO Differential Evolution DE ant colony optimization ACO and their variants dominate the field of natureinspired metaheuristics 11 This list includes algorithms published up to circa the year 2000 A large number of more recent metaphorinspired metaheuristics have started to attract criticism in the research community for hiding their lack of novelty behind an elaborate metaphor For algorithms published since that time see List of metaphorbased metaheuristics Stochastic diffusion search Bishop 1989 edit Main article Stochastic diffusion search First published in 1989 Stochastic diffusion search SDS 12 13 was the first Swarm Intelligence metaheuristic SDS is an agentbased probabilistic global search and optimization technique best suited to problems where the objective function can be decomposed into multiple independent partialfunctions Each agent maintains a hypothesis which is iteratively tested by evaluating a randomly selected partial objective function parameterised by the agents current hypothesis In the standard version of SDS such partial function evaluations are binary resulting in each agent becoming active or inactive Information on hypotheses is diffused across the population via interagent communication Unlike the stigmergic communication used in ACO in SDS agents communicate hypotheses via a onetoone communication strategy analogous to the tandem running procedure observed in Leptothorax acervorum 14 A positive feedback mechanism ensures that over time a population of agents stabilise around the globalbest solution SDS is both an efficient and robust global search and optimisation algorithm which has been extensively mathematically described 15 16 17 Recent work has involved merging the global search properties of SDS with other swarm intelligence algorithms 18 19 Ant colony optimization Dorigo 1992 edit Main article Ant colony optimization Ant colony optimization ACO introduced by Dorigo in his doctoral dissertation is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony ACO is a probabilistic technique useful in problems that deal with finding better paths through graphs Artificial antssimulation agentslocate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions Natural ants lay down pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment The simulated ants similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate for better solutions 20 Particle swarm optimization Kennedy Eberhart Shi 1995 edit Main article Particle swarm optimization Particle swarm optimization PSO is a global optimization algorithm for dealing with problems in which a best solution can be represented as a point or surface in an ndimensional space Hypotheses are plotted in this space and seeded with an initial velocity as well as a communication channel between the particles 21 22 Particles then move through the solution space and are evaluated according to some fitness criterion after each timestep Over time particles are accelerated towards those particles within their communication grouping which have better fitness values The main advantage of such an approach over other global minimization strategies such as simulated annealing is that the large number of members that make up the particle swarm make the technique impressively resilient to the problem of local minima Artificial Swarm Intelligence 2015 edit Artificial Swarm Intelligence ASI is method of amplifying the collective intelligence of networked human groups using control algorithms modeled after natural swarms Sometimes referred to as Human Swarming or Swarm AI the technology connects groups of human participants into realtime systems that deliberate and converge on solutions as dynamic swarms when simultaneously presented with a question 23 24 25 ASI has been used for a wide range of applications from enabling business teams to generate highly accurate financial forecasts 26 to enabling sports fans to outperform Vegas betting markets 27 ASI has also been used to enable groups of doctors to generate diagnoses with significantly higher accuracy than traditional methods 28 29 Applications edit Swarm Intelligencebased techniques can be used in a number of applications The US military is investigating swarm techniques for controlling unmanned vehicles The European Space Agency is thinking about an orbital swarm for selfassembly and interferometry NASA is investigating the use of swarm technology for planetary mapping A 1992 paper by M Anthony Lewis and George A Bekey discusses the possibility of using swarm intelligence to control nanobots within the body for the purpose of killing cancer tumors 30 Conversely alRifaie and Aber have used stochastic diffusion search to help locate tumours 31 32 Swarm intelligence has also been applied for data mining 33 Ant based models are further subject of modern management theory 34 Antbased routing edit The use of swarm intelligence in telecommunication networks has also been researched in the form of antbased routing This was pioneered separately by Dorigo et al and Hewlett Packard in the mid1990s with a number of variants existing Basically this uses a probabilistic routing table rewardingreinforcing the route successfully traversed by each ant a small control packet which flood the network Reinforcement of the route in the forwards reverse direction and both simultaneously have been researched backwards reinforcement requires a symmetric network and couples the two directions together forwards reinforcement rewards a route before the outcome is known but then one would pay for the cinema before one knows how good the film is As the system behaves stochastically and is therefore lacking repeatability there are large hurdles to commercial deployment Mobile media and new technologies have the potential to change the threshold for collective action due to swarm intelligence Rheingold 2002 P175 The location of transmission infrastructure for wireless communication networks is an important engineering problem involving competing objectives A minimal selection of locations or sites are required subject to providing adequate area coverage for users A very differentant inspired swarm intelligence algorithm stochastic diffusion search SDS has been successfully used to provide a general model for this problem related to circle packing and set covering It has been shown that the SDS can be applied to identify suitable solutions even for large problem instances 35 Airlines have also used antbased routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates At Southwest Airlines a software program uses swarm theory or swarm intelligencethe idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate The pilot learns from his experience whats the best for him and it turns out that thats the best solution for the airline Douglas A Lawson explains As a result the colony of pilots always go to gates they can arrive at and depart from quickly The program can even alert a pilot of plane backups before they happen We can anticipate that its going to happen so well have a gate available Lawson says 36 Crowd simulation edit Artists are using swarm technology as a means of creating complex interactive systems or simulating crowds Stanley and Stella in Breaking the Ice was the first movie to make use of swarm technology for rendering realistically depicting the movements of groups of fish and birds using the Boids system Tim Burtons Batman Returns also made use of swarm technology for showing the movements of a group of bats The Lord of the Rings film trilogy made use of similar technology known as Massive during battle scenes Swarm technology is particularly attractive because it is cheap robust and simple Airlines have used swarm theory to simulate passengers boarding a plane Southwest Airlines researcher Douglas A Lawson used an antbased computer simulation employing only six interaction rules to evaluate boarding times using various boarding methodsMiller 2010 xiixviii 37 Human swarming edit Human Swarm this animated GIF shows a group of networked human participants thinking together as a realtime system ie a Hive Mind moderated by swarming algorithms Enabled by mediating software such as the SWARM platform formally unu from Unanimous AI networks of distributed users can be organized into human swarms through the implementation of realtime closedloop control systems 38 39 40 39 As published by Rosenberg 2015 such realtime systems enable groups of human participants to behave as a unified collective intelligence that works as a single entity to make predictions answer questions and evoke opinions 41 Such systems also referred to as Artificial Swarm Intelligence or the brand name Swarm AI have been shown to significantly amplify human intelligence 42 43 24 resulting in a string of highprofile predictions of extreme accuracy 44 45 46 47 39 27 Academic testing shows that human swarms can outpredict individuals across a variety of realworld projections 48 49 40 50 51 Famously human swarming was used to correctly predict the Kentucky Derby Superfecta against 541 to 1 odds in response to a challenge from reporters 52 Medical Use of Human Swarmingin 2018 Stanford University School of Medicine and Unanimous AI published studies showing that groups of human doctors when connected together by realtime swarming algorithms could diagnose medical conditions with substantially higher accuracy than individual doctors or groups of doctors working together using traditional crowdsourcing methods In one such study swarms of human radiologists connected together using the SWARM platform were tasked with diagnosing chest xrays and demonstrated a 33 reduction in diagnostic errors as compared to the traditional human methods and a 22 improvement over traditional machinelearning 28 53 54 55 29 Swarm grammars edit Swarm grammars are swarms of stochastic grammars that can be evolved to describe complex properties such as found in art and architecture 56 These grammars interact as agents behaving according to rules of swarm intelligence Such behavior can also suggest deep learning algorithms in particular when mapping of such swarms to neural circuits is considered 57 Swarmic art edit In a series of works alRifaie et al 58 have successfully used two swarm intelligence algorithmsone mimicking the behaviour of one species of ants Leptothorax acervorum foraging stochastic diffusion search SDS and the other algorithm mimicking the behaviour of birds flocking particle swarm optimization PSOto describe a novel integration strategy exploiting the local search properties of the PSO with global SDS behaviour The resulting hybrid algorithm is used to sketch novel drawings of an input image exploiting an artistic tension between the local behaviour of the birds flockingas they seek to follow the input sketchand the global behaviour of the ants foragingas they seek to encourage the flock to explore novel regions of the canvas The creativity of this hybrid swarm system has been analysed under the philosophical light of the rhizome in the context of Deleuze s Orchid and Wasp metaphor 59 A more recent work of alRifaie et al Swarmic Sketches and Attention Mechanism 60 introduces a novel approach deploying the mechanism of attention by adapting SDS to selectively attend to detailed areas of a digital canvas Once the attention of the swarm is drawn to a certain line within the canvas the capability of PSO is used to produce a swarmic sketch of the attended line The swarms move throughout the digital canvas in an attempt to satisfy their dynamic rolesattention to areas with more detailsassociated to them via their fitness function Having associated the rendering process with the concepts of attention the performance of the participating swarms creates a unique nonidentical sketch each time the artist swarms embark on interpreting the input line drawings In other works while PSO is responsible for the sketching process SDS controls the attention of the swarm In a similar work Swarmic Paintings and Colour Attention 61 nonphotorealistic images are produced using SDS algorithm which in the context of this work is responsible for colour attention The computational creativity of the abovementioned systems are discussed in 58 62 63 through the two prerequisites of creativity ie freedom and constraints within the swarm intelligences two infamous phases of exploration and exploitation Michael Theodore and Nikolaus Correll use swarm intelligent art installation to explore what it takes to have engineered systems to appear lifelike 64 Notable researchers edit Nikolaus Correll Marco Dorigo Russell C Eberhart Luca Maria Gambardella James Kennedy Alcherio Martinoli Craig Reynolds Louis
