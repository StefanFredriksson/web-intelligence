Glossaries Artificial intelligence Computer science Electrical and electronics engineering v t e Microsoft Solutions Framework MSF is a set of principles models disciplines concepts and guidelines for delivering information technology services from Microsoft MSF is not limited to developing applications only it is also applicable to other IT projects like deployment networking or infrastructure projects MSF does not force the developer to use a specific methodology such as the waterfall model or agile software development Contents 1 History 2 Components 3 References 4 External links History edit MSF was first introduced by Microsoft as version 10 in 1993 and a version 20 was released in 1997 In 2002 MSF version 30 was released It modified version 20 in the following ways Combined previously separate models into unified Team and Process models designed for application across a variety of project types including deployment enterprise software integration and development projects Folded the Application Development and Infrastructure Deployment models into a single Process Model consisting of five phases Added Project Management and Readiness Management Disciplines Made changes to the Risk Management Discipline Added links between MSF and the Microsoft Operations Framework MOF Added an MSF Practitioner Program designed to train individuals to lead or participate in MSF projects 1 MSF version 40 was released in 2005 The release was a major refresh of the Process Model now called the Governance Model and the Team Model 2 MSF 40 included techniques for two separate methodologies MSF for Agile Software Development MSF Agile and MSF for CMMI Process Improvement MSF4CMMI 3 Components edit MSF 40 is a combination of a metamodel which can be used as a base for prescriptive software engineering processes and two customizable and scalable software engineering processes The MSF metamodel consists of foundational principles a team model and cycles and iterations MSF 40 provides a higherlevel framework of guidance and principles which can be mapped to a variety of prescriptive process templates It is structured in both descriptive and prescriptive methodologies The descriptive component is called the MSF 40 metamodel which is a theoretical description of the SDLC best practices for creating SDLC methodologies Microsoft is of the opinion that organizations have diverging dynamics and contrary priorities during their software development some organizations need a responsive and adaptable software development environment while others need a standardized repeatable and more controlled environment To fulfill these needs Microsoft represents the metamodel of MSF 40 in two prescriptive methodology templates that provide specific process guidance for agile software development MSF4ASD and for the Capability Maturity Model MSF4CMMI These software engineering processes can be modified and customized to the preferences of organization customer and project team The MSF philosophy holds that there is no single structure or process that optimally applies to the requirements and environments for all sorts of projects Therefore MSF supports multiple process approaches so it can be adapted to support any project regardless of size or complexity This flexibility means that it can support a wide degree of variation in the implementation of software engineering processes while retaining a set of core principles and mindsets The MSF process model consists of series of short development cycles and iterations This model embraces rapid iterative development with continuous learning and refinement due to progressive understanding of the business and project of the stakeholders Identifying requirements product development and testing occur in overlapping iterations resulting in incremental completion to ensure a flow of value of the project Each iteration has a different focus and result in a stable portion
