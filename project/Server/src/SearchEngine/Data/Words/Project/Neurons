single pyramidal neuron the primary excitatory neuron of cerebral cortex with a synaptic connection from an incoming axon onto a dendritic spine A neuron also known as a neurone old British spelling or nerve cell is an electrically excitable cell 1 that communicates with other cells via specialized connections called synapses It is the main component of nervous tissue All animals except sponges and placozoans have neurons but other multicellular organisms such as plants do not Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their function Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch sound or light that affect the cells of the sensory organs and they send signals to the spinal cord or brain Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions to glandular output Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord A group of connected neurons is called a neural circuit A typical neuron consists of a cell body soma dendrites and a single axon The soma is usually compact The axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few hundred micrometers from the soma The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock and travels for as far as 1 meter in humans or more in other species It branches but usually maintains a constant diameter At the farthest tip of the axons branches are axon terminals where the neuron can transmit a signal across the synapse to another cell Neurons may lack dendrites or have no axon The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon particularly when the cell is undifferentiated Most neurons receive signals via the dendrites and soma and send out signals down the axon At the majority of synapses signals cross from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another However synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite The signaling process is partly electrical and partly chemical Neurons are electrically excitable due to maintenance of voltage gradients across their membranes If the voltage changes by a large enough amount over a short interval the neuron generates an allornothing electrochemical pulse called an action potential This potential travels rapidly along the axon and activates synaptic connections as it reaches them Synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory increasing or reducing the net voltage that reaches the soma In most cases neurons are generated by neural stem cells during brain development and childhood Neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain However strong evidence supports generation of substantial numbers of new neurons in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb 2 3 mwparseroutput toclimit2 toclevel1 ulmwparseroutput toclimit3 toclevel2 ulmwparseroutput toclimit4 toclevel3 ulmwparseroutput toclimit5 toclevel4 ulmwparseroutput

between the brain spinal cord and rest of the nerves in the body is demonstrated Neurons are the primary components of the nervous system along with the glial cells that give them structural and metabolic support The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system which includes the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system which includes the autonomic and somatic nervous systems In vertebrates the majority of neurons belong to the central nervous system but some reside in peripheral ganglia and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as the retina and cochlea Axons may bundle into fascicles that make up the nerves in the peripheral nervous system like strands of wire make up cables Bundles of axons in the central nervous system are called tracts Anatomy and histology edit Structure of a typical neuron Neuron peripheral nervous system Dendrite Soma Axon Nucleus Node of Ranvier Axon terminal Schwann cell Myelin sheath Neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals Given their diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system there is a wide variety in their shape size and electrochemical properties For instance the soma of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 micrometers in diameter 4 The soma is the body of the neuron As it contains the nucleus most protein synthesis occurs here The nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter 5 The dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches This overall shape and structure is referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree This is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the dendritic spine The axon is a finer cablelike projection that can extend tens hundreds or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length The axon primarily carries nerve signals away from the soma and carries some types of information back to it Many neurons have only one axon but this axon mayand usually willundergo extensive branching enabling communication with many target cells The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock Besides being an anatomical structure the axon hillock also has the greatest density of voltagedependent sodium channels This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon In electrophysiological terms it has the most negative threshold potential While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow this region can also receive input from other neurons The axon terminal is found at the end of the axon farthest from the soma and contains synapses Synaptic boutons are specialized structures where neurotransmitter chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons In addition to synaptic boutons at the axon terminal a neuron may have en passant boutons which are located along the length of the axon Neuron cell body The accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components however dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their socalled main function Diagram of a typical myelinated vertebrate motor neuron Axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker The soma is usually about 1025 micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains The longest axon of a human motor neuron can be over a meter long reaching from the base of the spine to the toes Sensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the posterior column of the spinal cord over 15 meters in adults Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size 051 millimeters thick several centimeters long Fully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic 6 however stem cells present in the adult brain may regenerate functional neurons throughout the life of an organism see neurogenesis Astrocytes are starshaped glial cells They have been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of their stem celllike characteristic of pluripotency Membrane edit Like all animal cells the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator but in neurons many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that chemically transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions Some ion channels are voltage gated meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane Others are chemically gated meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid The ion materials include sodium potassium chloride and calcium The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane typically a bit less than 110 of a volt at baseline This voltage has two functions first it provides a power source for an assortment of voltagedependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane second it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane Histology and internal structure edit Golgistained neurons in human hippocampal tissue Actin filaments in a mouse Cortical Neuron in culture Numerous microscopic clumps called Nissl bodies or Nissl substance are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic baseloving dye These structures consist of rough endoplasmic reticulum and associated ribosomal RNA Named after German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Franz Nissl 18601919 they are involved in protein synthesis and their prominence can be explained by the fact that nerve cells are very metabolically active Basophilic dyes such as aniline or weakly haematoxylin 7 highlight negatively charged components and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the ribosomal RNA The cell body of a neuron is supported by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments which together with neurotubules neuronal microtubules are assembled into larger neurofibrils 8 Some neurons also contain pigment granules such as neuromelanin a brownishblack pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines and lipofuscin a yellowishbrown pigment both of which accumulate with age 9 10 11 Other structural proteins that are important for neuronal function are actin and the tubulin of microtubules Class III βtubulin is found almost exclusively in neurons Actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during neuronal development There the actin dynamics can be modulated via an interplay with microtubule 12 There are different internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites Typical axons almost never contain ribosomes except some in the initial segment Dendrites contain granular endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes in diminishing amounts as the distance from the cell body increases Classification edit Image of pyramidal neurons in mouse cerebral cortex expressing green fluorescent protein The red staining indicates GABAergic interneurons 13 SMI32stained pyramidal neurons in cerebral cortex See also List of distinct cell types in the adult human body Nervous system Neurons vary in shape and size and can be classified by their morphology and function 14 The anatomist Camillo Golgi grouped neurons into two types type I with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type II with short axons which can often be confused with dendrites Type I cells can be further classified by the location of the soma The basic morphology of type I neurons represented by spinal motor neurons consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by a myelin sheath The dendritic tree wraps around the cell body and receives signals from other neurons The end of the axon has branching terminals axon terminal that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron Structural classification edit Polarity edit Different kinds of neurons 1 Unipolar neuron 2 Bipolar neuron 3 Multipolar neuron 4 Pseudounipolar neuron Most neurons can be anatomically characterized as Unipolar single process Bipolar 1 axon and 1 dendrite Multipolar 1 axon and 2 or more dendrites Golgi I neurons with projecting axonal processes examples are pyramidal cells Purkinje cells and anterior horn cells Golgi II neurons whose axonal process projects locally the best example is the granule cell Anaxonic where the axon cannot be distinguished from the dendrites Pseudounipolar 1 process which then serves as both an axon and a dendrite Other edit Some unique neuronal types can be identified according to their location in the nervous system and distinct shape Some examples are Basket cells interneurons that form a dense plexus of terminals around the soma of target cells found in the cortex and cerebellum Betz cells large motor neurons Lugaro cells interneurons of the cerebellum Medium spiny neurons most neurons in the corpus striatum Purkinje cells huge neurons in the cerebellum a type of Golgi I multipolar neuron Pyramidal cells neurons with triangular soma a type of Golgi I Renshaw cells neurons with both ends linked to alpha motor neurons Unipolar brush cells interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brushlike tuft Granule cells a type of Golgi II neuron Anterior horn cells motoneurons located in the spinal cord Spindle cells interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain Functional classification edit Direction edit Afferent neurons convey information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system and are also called sensory neurons Efferent neurons motor neurons transmit signals from the central nervous system to the effector cells Interneurons connect neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system Afferent and efferent also refer generally to neurons that respectively bring information to or send information from the brain Action on other neurons edit A neuron affects other neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that binds to chemical receptors The effect upon the postsynaptic neuron is determined by the type of receptor that is activated not by the presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a key and a receptor as a lock the same neurotransmitter can activate multiple types of receptors Receptors can be classified broadly as excitatory causing an increase in firing rate inhibitory causing a decrease in firing rate or modulatory causing longlasting effects not directly related to firing rate The two most common 90 neurotransmitters in the brain glutamate and GABA have largely consistent actions Glutamate acts on several types of receptors and has effects that are excitatory at ionotropic receptors and a modulatory effect at metabotropic receptors Similarly GABA acts on several types of receptors but all of them have inhibitory effects in adult animals at least Because of this consistency it is common for neuroscientists to refer to cells that release glutamate as excitatory neurons and cells that release GABA as inhibitory neurons Some other types of neurons have consistent effects for example excitatory motor neurons in the spinal cord that release acetylcholine and inhibitory spinal neurons that release glycine The distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute Rather it depends on the class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron In principle a single neuron releasing a single neurotransmitter can have excitatory effects on some targets inhibitory effects on others and modulatory effects on others still For example photoreceptor cells in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light Socalled OFF bipolar cells are like most neurons excited by the released glutamate However neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate because they lack typical ionotropic glutamate receptors and instead express a class of inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors 15 When light is present the photoreceptors cease releasing glutamate which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition activating them this simultaneously removes the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells silencing them It is possible to identify the type of inhibitory effect a presynaptic neuron will have on a postsynaptic neuron based on the proteins the presynaptic neuron expresses Parvalbumin expressing neurons typically dampen the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the visual cortex whereas somatostatin expressing neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron 16 Discharge patterns edit Neurons have intrinsic electroresponsive properties like intrinsic transmembrane voltage oscillatory patterns 17 So neurons can be classified according to their electrophysiological characteristics Tonic or regular spiking Some neurons are typically constantly tonically active typically firing at a constant frequency Example interneurons in neurostriatum Phasic or bursting Neurons that fire in bursts are called phasic Fast spiking Some neurons are notable for their high firing rates for example some types of cortical inhibitory interneurons cells in globus pallidus retinal ganglion cells 18 19 Neurotransmitter edit Cholinergic neuronsacetylcholine Acetylcholine is released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft It acts as a ligand for both ligandgated ion channels and metabotropic GPCRs muscarinic receptors Nicotinic receptors are pentameric ligandgated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of Na depolarization and increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl coenzyme A GABAergic neurons gamma aminobutyric acid GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the central nervous system CNS along with glycine GABA has a homologous function to ACh gating anion channels that allow Cl ions to enter the post synaptic neuron Cl causes hyperpolarization within the neuron decreasing the probability of an action potential firing as the voltage becomes more negative for an action potential to fire a positive voltage threshold must be reached GABA is synthesized from glutamate neurotransmitters by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase Glutamatergic neuronsglutamate Glutamate is one of two primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters along with aspartate Glutamate receptors are one of four categories three of which are ligandgated ion channels and one of which is a Gprotein coupled receptor often referred to as GPCR AMPA and Kainate receptors function as cation channels permeable to Na cation channels mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission NMDA receptors are another cation channel that is more permeable to Ca 2 The function of NMDA receptors depend on glycine receptor binding as a co agonist within the channel pore NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present Metabotropic receptors GPCRs modulate synaptic transmission and postsynaptic excitability Glutamate can cause excitotoxicity when blood flow to the brain is interrupted resulting in brain damage When blood flow is suppressed glutamate is released from presynaptic neurons causing greater NMDA and AMPA receptor activation than normal outside of stress conditions leading to elevated Ca 2 and Na entering the post synaptic neuron and cell damage Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid glutamine by the enzyme glutamate synthase Dopaminergic neurons dopamine Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that acts on D1 type D1 and D5 Gscoupled receptors which increase cAMP and PKA and D2 type D2 D3 and D4 receptors which activate Gicoupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA Dopamine is connected to mood and behavior and modulates both pre and postsynaptic neurotransmission Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra has been linked to Parkinsons disease Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine Tyrosine is catalyzed into levadopa or LDOPA by tyrosine hydroxlase and levadopa is then converted into dopamine by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase Serotonergic neurons serotonin Serotonin 5Hydroxytryptamine 5HT can act as excitatory or inhibitory Of its four 5HT receptor classes 3 are GPCR and 1 is a ligandgated cation channel Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase and then further by decarboxylase A lack of 5HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to depression Drugs that block the presynaptic serotonin transporter are used for treatment such as Prozac and Zoloft Connectivity edit Main articles Synapse and Chemical synapse A signal propagating down an axon to the cell body and dendrites of the next cell Chemical synapse Neurons communicate with each another via synapses where either the axon terminal of one cell contacts another neurons dendrite soma or less commonly axon Neurons such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have over 1000 dendritic branches making connections with tens of thousands of other cells other neurons such as the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus have only one or two dendrites each of which receives thousands of synapses Synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory either increasing or decreasing activity in the target neuron respectively Some neurons also communicate via electrical synapses which are direct electrically conductive junctions between cells 20 When an action potential reaches the axon terminal it opens voltagegated calcium channels allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal Calcium causes synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the membrane releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron High cytosolic calcium in the axon terminal triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake which in turn activates mitochondrial energy metabolism to produce ATP to support continuous neurotransmission 21 An autapse is a synapse in which a neurons axon connects to its own dendrites The human brain has some 86 x 10 10 eighty six billion neurons 22 Each neuron has on average 7000 synaptic connections to other neurons It has been estimated that the brain of a threeyearold child has about 10 15 synapses 1 quadrillion This number declines with age stabilizing by adulthood Estimates vary for an adult ranging from 10 14 to 5 x 10 14 synapses 100 to 500 trillion 23 An annotated diagram of the stages of an action potential propagating down an axon including the role of ion concentration and pump and channel proteins Mechanisms for propagating action potentials edit In 1937 John Zachary Young suggested that the squid giant axon could be used to study neuronal electrical properties 24 It is larger than but similar to human neurons making it easier to study By inserting electrodes into the squid giant axons accurate measurements were made of the membrane potential The cell membrane of the axon and soma contain voltagegated ion channels that allow the neuron to generate and propagate an electrical signal an action potential Some neurons also generate subthreshold membrane potential oscillations These signals are generated and propagated by chargecarrying ions including sodium Na potassium K chloride Cl and calcium Ca 2 Several stimuli can activate a neuron leading to electrical activity including pressure stretch chemical transmitters and changes of the electric potential across the cell membrane 25 Stimuli cause specific ionchannels within the cell membrane to open leading to a flow of ions through the cell membrane changing the membrane potential Neurons must maintain the specific electrical properties that define their neuron type 26 Thin neurons and axons require less metabolic expense to produce and carry action potentials but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction many neurons have insulating sheaths of myelin around their axons The sheaths are formed by glial cells oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system The sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter whilst using less energy The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1mm long punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier which contain a high density of voltagegated ion channels Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from demyelination of axons in the central nervous system Some neurons do not generate action potentials but instead generate a graded electrical signal which in turn causes graded neurotransmitter release Such nonspiking neurons tend to be sensory neurons or interneurons because they cannot carry signals long distances Neural coding edit Neural coding is concerned with how sensory and other information is represented in the brain by neurons The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the stimulus and the individual or ensemble neuronal responses and the relationships among the electrical activities of the neurons within the ensemble 27 It is thought that neurons can encode both digital and analog information 28 Allornone principle edit As long as the stimulus reaches the threshold the full response would be given Larger stimulus does not result in a larger response vice versa 29 31 Main article Allornone law The conduction of nerve impulses is an example of an allornone response In other words if a neuron responds at all then it must respond completely Greater intensity of stimulation like brighter imagelouder sound does not produce a stronger signal but can increase firing frequency 29 31 Receptors respond in different ways to stimuli Slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing Tonic receptors most often respond to increased intensity of stimulus by increasing their firing frequency usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where greater intensity of a specific frequency color requires more photons as the photons cant become stronger for a specific frequency Other receptor types include quickly adapting or phasic receptors where firing decreases or stops with steady stimulus examples include skin which when touched causes neurons to fire but if the object maintains even pressure the neurons stop firing The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to pressure and vibration have filtering accessory structures that aid their function The pacinian corpuscle is one such structure It has concentric layers like an onion which form around the axon terminal When pressure is applied and the corpuscle is deformed mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon which fires If the pressure is steady stimulus ends thus typically these neurons respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed which causes the corpuscle to change shape again Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of a number of other neurons 30 History edit Further information History of neuroscience Drawing by Camillo Golgi of a hippocampus stained using the silver nitrate method Drawing of a Purkinje cell in the cerebellar cortex done by Santiago Ramón y Cajal demonstrating the ability of Golgis staining method to reveal fine detail The neurons place as the primary functional unit of the nervous system was first recognized in the late 19th century through the work of the Spanish anatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal 31 To make the structure of individual neurons visible Ramón y Cajal improved a silver staining process that had been developed by Camillo Golgi 31 The improved process involves a technique called double impregnation and is still in use In 1888 Ramón y Cajal published a paper about the bird cerebellum In this paper he stated that he could not find evidence for anastomosis between axons and dendrites and called each nervous element an absolutely autonomous canton 31 32 This became known as the neuron doctrine one of the central tenets of modern neuroscience 31 In 1891 German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer wrote a highly influential review about the neuron doctrine in which he introduced the term neuron to describe the anatomical and physiological unit of the nervous system 33 34 The silver impregnation stains are a useful method for neuroanatomical investigations because for reasons unknown it stains only a small percentage of cells in a tissue exposing the complete micro structure of individual neurons without much overlap from other cells 35 Neuron doctrine edit Drawing of neurons in the pigeon cerebellum by Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal in 1899 A denotes Purkinje cells and B denotes granule cells both of which are multipolar The neuron doctrine is the now fundamental idea that neurons are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system The theory was put forward by Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the late 19th century It held that neurons are discrete cells not connected in a meshwork acting as metabolically distinct units Later discoveries yielded refinements to the doctrine For example glial cells which are not considered neurons play an essential role in information processing 36 Also electrical synapses are more common than previously thought 37 comprising direct cytoplasmic connections between neurons In fact neurons can form even tighter couplings the squid giant axon arises from the fusion of multiple axons 38 Ramón y Cajal also postulated the Law of Dynamic Polarization which states that a neuron receives signals at its dendrites and cell body and transmits them as action potentials along the axon in one direction away from the cell body 39 The Law of Dynamic Polarization has important exceptions dendrites can serve as synaptic output sites of neurons 40 and axons can receive synaptic inputs 41 Compartmental Model of Neurons edit Although neurons are often described of as fundamental units of the brain they perform internal computations Neurons integrate input within dendrites and this complexity is lost in models that assume neurons to be a fundamental unit Dendritic branches can be modeled as spatial compartments whose activity is related due to passive membrane properties but may also be different depending on input from synapses Compartmental modelling of dendrites is especially helpful for understanding the behavior of neurons that are too small to record with electrodes as is the case for Drosophila melanogaster 42 Neurons in the brain edit The number of neurons in the brain varies dramatically from species to species 43 In a human there are an estimated 1020 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex and 5570 billion neurons in the cerebellum 44 By contrast the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has just 302 neurons making it an ideal model organism as scientists have been able to map all of its neurons The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster a common subject in biological experiments has around 100000 neurons and exhibits many complex behaviors Many properties of neurons from the type of neurotransmitters used to ion channel composition are maintained across species allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms in much simpler experimental systems

inherited disorder of nerves neuropathy that is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation predominantly in the feet and legs extending to the hands and arms in advanced stages Presently incurable this disease is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders with 36 in 100000 affected 45 Alzheimers disease AD also known simply as Alzheimers is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration together with declining activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes 46 The most striking early symptom is loss of shortterm memory amnesia which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression with relative preservation of older memories As the disorder progresses cognitive intellectual impairment extends to the domains of language aphasia skilled movements apraxia and recognition agnosia and functions such as decisionmaking and planning become impaired 47 48 Parkinsons disease PD also known as Parkinson disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs motor skills and speech 49 Parkinsons disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders 50 It is characterized by muscle rigidity tremor a slowing of physical movement bradykinesia and in extreme cases a loss of physical movement akinesia The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain Secondary symptoms may include high level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems PD is both chronic and progressive Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities Weakness is typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants cholinesterase inhibitors and in selected cases thymectomy Demyelination edit Further information Demyelinating disease GuillainBarré syndrome demyelination Demyelination is the act of demyelinating or the loss of the myelin sheath insulating the nerves When myelin degrades conduction of signals along the nerve can be impaired or lost and the nerve eventually withers This leads to certain neurodegenerative disorders like multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy Axonal degeneration edit Although most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration which is rapid separation of the proximal and distal ends within 30 minutes of injury Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma and eventually leads to bead like formation Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner organelles occurs after axolemma degradation Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the paranodal regions at the site of injury Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases caused by influx of calcium ion suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process that produces complete fragmentation The process takes about roughly 24 hrs in the PNS and longer in the CNS The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are unknown Neurogenesis edit Main article Neurogenesis Neurons are born through the process of neurogenesis in which neural stem cells divide to produce differentiated neurons Once fully differentiated neurons are formed they are no longer capable of undergoing mitosis Neurogenesis primarily occurs in the embryo of most organisms Neurogenesis can occur in the adult vertebrate brain a finding that led to controversy in 1999 51 Later studies of the age of human neurons suggest that this process occurs only for a minority of cells and a vast majority of neurons composing the neocortex forms before birth and persists without replacement 3 The extent to which adult neurogenesis exists in humans and its contribution to cognition are controversial with conflicting reports published in 2018 52 The body contains a variety of stem cell types that have the capacity to differentiate into neurons Researchers found a way to transform human skin cells into nerve cells using transdifferentiation in which cells are forced to adopt new identities 53 During neurogenesis in the mammalian brain progenitor and stem cells progress from proliferative divisions to differentiative divisions This progression leads to the neurons and glia that populate cortical layers Epigenetic modifications play a key role in regulating gene expression in differentiating neural stem cells and are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain Epigenetic modifications include DNA cytosine methylation to form 5methylcytosine and 5methylcytosine demethylation 54 These modifications are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain DNA cytosine methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases DNMTs Methylcytosine demethylation is catalyzed in several stages by TET enzymes that carry out oxidative reactions eg 5methylcytosine to 5hydroxymethylcytosine and enzymes of the DNA base excision repair BER pathway 54 At different stages of mammalian nervous system development two DNA repair processes are employed in the repair of DNA doublestrand breaks These pathways are homologous recombinational repair used in proliferating neural precursor cells and nonhomologous end joining used mainly at later developmental stages 55 Nerve regeneration edit Main article

the Revista in 1888 He acknowledged that he found the nerve fibers to be very intricate but stated that he could find no evidence for either axons or dendrites undergoing anastomosis and forming nets He called each nervous element an absolutely autonomous canton Finger 1994 p47 a man who would write a highly influential review of the evidence in favor of the neuron doctrine two years later In his paper Waldeyer 1891 wrote that nerve cells terminate freely with end arborizations and that the neuron is the anatomical and physiological unit of the nervous system The word neuron was born this way
