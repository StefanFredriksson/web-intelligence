Deep Blue chess computer Chess computer Deep Blue at the Computer History Museum Deep Blue was a chessplaying computer developed by IBM It is known for being the first computer chessplaying system to win both a chess game and a chess match against a reigning world champion under regular time controls Deep Blue won its first game against a world champion on 10 February 1996 when it defeated Garry Kasparov in game one of a sixgame match However Kasparov won three and drew two of the following five games defeating Deep Blue by a score of 42 Deep Blue was then heavily upgraded and played Kasparov again in May 1997 1 Deep Blue won game six thereby winning the sixgame rematch 32 and becoming the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls 2 Kasparov accused IBM of cheating 3 and demanded a rematch IBM refused and dismantled Deep Blue Development for Deep Blue began in 1985 with the ChipTest project at Carnegie Mellon University This project eventually evolved into Deep Thought at which point the development team was hired by IBM 4 The project evolved once more with the new name Deep Blue in 1989 Grandmaster Joel Benjamin was also part of the development team Contents 1 Origins 11 Design 2 Deep Blue versus Kasparov 3 Aftermath 4 See also 5 References 51 Bibliography 6 Further reading 7 External links Origins edit The project was started as ChipTest at Carnegie Mellon University by Fenghsiung Hsu followed by its successor Deep Thought After their graduation from Carnegie Mellon Hsu Thomas Anantharaman and Murray Campbell from the Deep Thought team were hired by IBM Research to continue their quest to build a chess machine that could defeat the world champion 5 Hsu and Campbell joined IBM in autumn 1989 with Anantharaman following later 6 Anantharaman subsequently left IBM for Wall Street and Arthur Joseph Hoane joined the team to perform programming tasks 7 Jerry Brody a longtime employee of IBM Research was recruited for the team in 1990 8 The team was managed first by Randy Moulic followed by ChungJen C J Tan 9 After Deep Thoughts 1989 match against Kasparov IBM held a contest to rename the chess machine and it became Deep Blue a play on IBMs nickname Big Blue 10 After a scaleddown version of Deep Blue Deep Blue Jr played Grandmaster Joel Benjamin Hsu and Campbell decided that Benjamin was the expert they were looking for to develop Deep Blues opening book and Benjamin was signed by IBM Research to assist with the preparations for Deep Blues matches against Garry Kasparov 11 In 1995 Deep Blue prototype actually Deep Thought II renamed for PR reasons played in the 8th World Computer Chess Championship Deep Blue prototype played the computer program Wchess to a draw while Wchess was running on a personal computer In round 5 Deep Blue prototype had the white pieces and lost to the computer program Fritz 3 in 39 moves while Fritz was running on an Intel Pentium 90 MHz personal computer In the end of the championship Deep Blue prototype was tied for second place with the computer program Junior while Junior was running on a personal computer 12 Design edit Deep Blue employed custom VLSI chips to execute the alphabeta search algorithm in parallel 13 an example of GOFAI Good OldFashioned Artificial Intelligence rather than of deep learning which would come a decade later It was a brute force approach and one of its developers even denied that it was artificial intelligence at all 14 Deep Blue versus Kasparov edit Main article Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov Deep Blue and Kasparov played each other on two occasions The first match began on 10 February 1996 in which Deep Blue became the first machine to win a chess game against a reigning world champion Garry Kasparov under regular time controls However Kasparov won three and drew two of the following five games beating Deep Blue by a score of 42 wins count 1 point draws count point The match concluded on 17 February 1996 Deep Blue was then heavily upgraded unofficially nicknamed Deeper Blue 15 and played Kasparov again in May 1997 winning the sixgame rematch 32 ending on 11 May Deep Blue won the deciding game six after Kasparov made a mistake in the opening becoming the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls The system derived its playing strength mainly from brute force computing power It was a massively parallel RS6000 SP Thin P2SC based system with 30 nodes with each node containing a 120MHz P2SC microprocessor enhanced with 480 special purpose VLSI chess chips Its chess playing program was written in C and ran under the AIX operating system It was capable of evaluating 200 million positions per second twice as fast as the 1996 version In June 1997 Deep Blue was the 259th most powerful supercomputer according to the TOP500 list achieving 1138 GFLOPS on the HighPerformance LINPACK benchmark 16 The Deep Blue chess computer that defeated Kasparov in 1997 would typically search to a depth of between six and eight moves to a maximum of twenty or even more moves in some situations 17 David Levy and Monty Newborn estimate that one additional ply halfmove increases the playing strength 50 to 70 Elo points 18 Kasparov in 1985 Deep Blues evaluation function was initially written in a generalized form with many tobedetermined parameters eg how important is a safe king position compared to a space advantage in the center etc The optimal values for these parameters were then determined by the system itself by analyzing thousands of master games The evaluation function had been split into 8000 parts many of them designed for special positions In the opening book there were over 4000 positions and 700000 grandmaster games The endgame database contained many sixpiece endgames and five or fewer piece positions Before the second match the chess knowledge of the program was finetuned by grandmaster Joel Benjamin The opening library was provided by grandmasters Miguel Illescas John Fedorowicz and Nick de Firmian 19 When Kasparov requested that he be allowed to study other games that Deep Blue had played so as to better understand his opponent IBM refused However Kasparov did study many popular PC games to become familiar with computer gameplay in general citation needed Writer Nate Silver suggests that a bug in Deep Blues software led to a seemingly random move the 44th in the first game of the second match which Kasparov misattributed to superior intelligence 20 21 Subsequently Kasparov experienced a decline in performance due to anxiety in the following game 21 Kasparov rejects this interpretation 22 Aftermath edit Computer scientists believed that playing chess was a good measurement for the effectiveness of artificial intelligence and by beating a world champion chess player IBM showed that they had made significant progress 23 After the loss Kasparov said that he sometimes saw deep intelligence and creativity in the machines moves suggesting that during the second game human chess players had intervened on behalf of the machine which would be a violation of the rules IBM denied that it cheated saying the only human intervention occurred between games The rules provided for the developers to modify the program between games an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computers play that were revealed during the course of the match Kasparov requested printouts of the machines log files but IBM refused although the company later published the logs on the Internet 24 Kasparov demanded a rematch but IBM refused and dismantled Deep Blue 25 Owing to an insufficient sample of games between Deep Blue and officially rated chess players a chess rating for Deep Blue was not established citation needed In 2003 a documentary film was made that explored these claims Entitled Game Over Kasparov and the Machine the film interviewed some people who suggest that Deep Blues victory was a ploy by IBM to boost its stock value 25 One of the cultural impacts of Deep Blue was the creation of a new game called Arimaa designed to be much more difficult for computers than chess 26 One of the two racks that made up Deep Blue is on display at the National Museum of American History in their exhibit about the Information Age 27 the other rack appears at the Computer History Museum in the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics gallery of the Revolution exhibit 28 Reports that Deep Blue was sold to United Airlines appear to originate from confusion between Deep Blue itself and other RS6000SP2 systems 29 Fenghsiung Hsu later claimed in his book Behind Deep Blue that he had the rights to use the Deep Blue design to build a bigger machine independently of IBM to take Kasparovs rematch offer but Kasparov refused a rematch 30 Deep Blue with its capability of evaluating 200 million positions per second was the fastest computer to face a world chess champion Today in computerchess research and matches of worldclass players against computers the focus of play has often shifted to software chess programs rather than using dedicated chess hardware Modern chess programs like Houdini Rybka Deep Fritz or Deep Junior are more efficient than the programs during Deep Blues era In a November 2006 match between Deep Fritz and world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik the program ran on a computer system containing a dualcore Intel Xeon 5160 CPU capable of evaluating only 8 million positions per second but searching to an average depth of 17 to 18 plies in the middlegame thanks to heuristics it won 42 31 32 See also edit AlphaGo Anticomputer tactics Deep Blue Kasparov 1996 Game 1 Deep Blue Kasparov 1997 Game 6 The Turk Watson computer
