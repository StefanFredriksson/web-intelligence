Mathematics in medieval Islam A page from The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing by AlKhwarizmi Mathematics during the Golden Age of Islam especially during the 9th and 10th centuries was built on Greek mathematics Euclid Archimedes Apollonius and Indian mathematics Aryabhata Brahmagupta Important progress was made such as the full development of the decimal placevalue system to include decimal fractions the first systematised study of algebra named for The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing by scholar AlKhwarizmi and advances in geometry and trigonometry 1 Arabic works also played an important role in the transmission of mathematics to Europe during the 10th to 12th centuries 2 Dr Sally P Ragep an historian of science in Islam estimates that tens of thousands of Arabic manuscripts in mathematical sciences and philosophy remain unread which give studies which reflect individual biases and a limited focus on a relatively few texts and scholars 3 Contents 1 Concepts 11 Algebra 12 Cubic equations 13 Induction 14 Irrational numbers 15 Spherical trigonometry 16 Negative numbers 17 Double false position 2 Other major figures 3

manuscript kept in Tehran University Algebra edit Further information History of algebra The study of algebra the name of which is derived from the Arabic word meaning completion or reunion of broken parts 4 flourished during the Islamic golden age Muhammad ibn Musa alKhwarizmi a scholar in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad is along with the Greek mathematician Diophantus known as the father of algebra In his book The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing AlKhwarizmi deals with ways to solve for the positive roots of first and second degree linear and quadratic polynomial equations He also introduces the method of reduction and unlike Diophantus gives general solutions for the equations he deals with 5 6 7 AlKhwarizmis algebra was rhetorical which means that the equations were written out in full sentences This was unlike the algebraic work of Diophantus which was syncopated meaning that some symbolism is used The transition to symbolic algebra where only symbols are used can be seen in the work of Ibn alBanna alMarrakushi and Abū alḤasan ibn ʿAlī alQalaṣādī 8 7 On the work done by AlKhwarizmi J J OConnor and Edmund F Robertson said 9 mwparseroutput

by Arabic mathematics began at this time with the work of alKhwarizmi namely the beginnings of algebra It is important to understand just how significant this new idea was It was a revolutionary move away from the Greek concept of mathematics which was essentially geometry Algebra was a unifying theory which allowed rational numbers irrational numbers geometrical magnitudes etc to all be treated as algebraic objects It gave mathematics a whole new development path so much broader in concept to that which had existed before and provided a vehicle for the future development of the subject Another important aspect of the introduction of algebraic ideas was that it allowed mathematics to be applied to itself in a way which had not happened before MacTutor History of Mathematics archive Several other mathematicians during this time period expanded on the algebra of AlKhwarizmi Abu Kamil Shuja wrote a book of algebra accompanied with geometrical illustrations and proofs He also enumerated all the possible solutions to some of his problems Abu alJud Omar Khayyam along with Sharaf alDīn alTūsī found several solutions of the cubic equation Omar Khayyam found the general geometric solution of a cubic equation Cubic equations edit To solve the thirddegree equation x 3 a 2 x b Khayyám constructed the parabola x 2 ay a circle with diameter b a 2 and a vertical line through the intersection point The solution is given by the length of the horizontal line segment from the origin to the intersection of the vertical line and the x axis Further information Cubic equation Omar Khayyam c 103848 in Iran 112324 10 wrote the Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra containing the systematic solution of cubic or thirdorder equations going beyond the Algebra of alKhwārizmī 11 Khayyám obtained the solutions of these equations by finding the intersection points of two conic sections This method had been used by the Greeks 12 but they did not generalize the method to cover all equations with positive roots 11 Sharaf alDīn alṬūsī in Tus Iran 12134 developed a novel approach to the investigation of cubic equationsan approach which entailed finding the point at which a cubic polynomial obtains its maximum value For example to solve the equation x 3 a b x displaystyle x3abx with a and b positive he would note that the maximum point of the curve y b x x 3 displaystyle ybxx3 occurs at x b 3 displaystyle xtextstyle sqrt frac b3 and that the equation would have no solutions one solution or two solutions depending on whether the height of the curve at that point was less than equal to or greater than a His surviving works give no indication of how he discovered his formulae for the maxima of these curves Various conjectures have been proposed to account for his discovery of them 13 Induction edit See also Mathematical induction History The earliest implicit traces of mathematical induction can be found in Euclid s proof that the number of primes is infinite c 300 BCE The first explicit formulation of the principle of induction was given by Pascal in his Traité du triangle arithmétique 1665 In between implicit proof by induction for arithmetic sequences was introduced by alKaraji c 1000 and continued by alSamawal who used it for special cases of the binomial theorem and properties of Pascals triangle Irrational numbers edit The Greeks had discovered irrational numbers but were not happy with them and only able to cope by drawing a distinction between magnitude and number In the Greek view magnitudes varied continuously and could be used for entities such as line segments whereas numbers were discrete Hence irrationals could only be handled geometrically and indeed Greek mathematics was mainly geometrical Islamic mathematicians including Abū Kāmil Shujāʿ ibn Aslam and Ibn Tahir alBaghdadi slowly removed the distinction between magnitude and number allowing irrational quantities to appear as coefficients in equations and to be solutions of algebraic equations 14 15 They worked freely with irrationals as mathematical objects but they did not examine closely their nature 16 In the twelfth century Latin translations of AlKhwarizmi s Arithmetic on the Indian numerals introduced the decimal positional number system to the Western world 17 His Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations In Renaissance Europe he was considered the original inventor of algebra although it is now known that his work is based on older Indian or Greek sources 18 He revised Ptolemy s Geography and wrote on astronomy and astrology However CA Nallino suggests that alKhwarizmis original work was not based on Ptolemy but on a derivative world map 19 presumably in Syriac or Arabic Spherical trigonometry edit Further information Law of sines and History of trigonometry The spherical law of sines was discovered in the 10th century it has been attributed variously to AbuMahmud Khojandi Nasir alDin alTusi and Abu Nasr Mansur with Abu alWafa Buzjani as a contributor 14 Ibn Muʿādh alJayyānī s The book of unknown arcs of a sphere in the 11th century introduced the general law of sines 20 The plane law of sines was described in the 13th century by Nasīr alDīn alTūsī In his On the Sector Figure he stated the law of sines for plane and spherical triangles and provided proofs for this law 21 Negative numbers edit Further information Negative numbers In the 9th century Islamic mathematicians were familiar with negative numbers from the works of Indian mathematicians but the recognition and use of negative numbers during this period remained timid 22 AlKhwarizmi did not use negative numbers or negative coefficients 22 But within fifty years Abu Kamil illustrated the rules of signs for expanding the multiplication a b c d displaystyle apm bcpm d 23 AlKaraji wrote in his book alFakhrī that negative quantities must be counted as terms 22 In the 10th century Abū alWafā alBūzjānī considered debts as negative numbers in A Book on What Is Necessary from the Science of Arithmetic for Scribes and Businessmen 23 By the 12th century alKarajis successors were to state the general rules of signs and use them to solve polynomial divisions 22 As alSamawal writes the product of a negative number alnāqiṣ by a positive number alzāʾid is negative and by a negative number is positive If we subtract a negative number from a higher negative number the remainder is their negative difference The difference remains positive if we subtract a negative number from a lower negative number If we subtract a negative number from a positive number the remainder is their positive sum If we subtract a positive number from an empty power martaba khāliyya the remainder is the same negative and if we subtract a negative number from an empty power the remainder is the same positive number 22 Double false position edit Further information False position method Between the 9th and 10th centuries the Egyptian mathematician Abu Kamil wrote a nowlost treatise on the use of double false position known as the Book of the Two Errors Kitāb alkhaṭāʾayn The oldest surviving writing on double false position from the Middle East is that of Qusta ibn Luqa 10th century an Arab mathematician from Baalbek Lebanon He justified the technique by a formal Euclideanstyle geometric proof Within the tradition of medieval Muslim mathematics double false position was known as hisāb alkhaṭāʾayn reckoning by two errors It was used for centuries to solve practical problems such as commercial and juridical questions estate partitions according to rules of Quranic inheritance as well as purely recreational problems The algorithm was often memorized with the aid of mnemonics such as a verse attributed to Ibn alYasamin and balancescale diagrams explained by alHassar and Ibn alBanna who were each mathematicians of Moroccan origin 24 Other major figures edit Abd alHamīd ibn Turk fl 830 quadratics Thabit ibn Qurra 826901 Sind ibn Ali d after 864 Ismail alJazari 11361206 Abū Sahl alQūhī c 9401000 centers of gravity

Islamic mathematics in medieval Islam History of calculus History of geometry Science in the medieval Islamic world Timeline of Islamic science and technology References edit Katz 1993 A complete history of mathematics of medieval Islam cannot yet be written since so many of these Arabic manuscripts lie unstudied Still the general outline is known In particular Islamic mathematicians fully developed the decimal placevalue number system to include decimal fractions systematised the study of algebra and began to consider the relationship between algebra and geometry studied and made advances on the major Greek geometrical treatises of Euclid Archimedes and Apollonius and made significant improvements in plane and spherical geometrySmith 1958 Vol 1 Chapter VII4 In a general way it may be said that the Golden Age of Arabian mathematics was confined largely to the 9th and 10th centuries that the world owes a great debt to Arab scholars for preserving and transmitting to posterity the classics of Greek mathematics and that their work was chiefly that of transmission although they developed considerable originality in algebra and showed some genius in their work in trigonometry
