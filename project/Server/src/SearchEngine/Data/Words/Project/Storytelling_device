List of narrative techniques A narrative technique also known more narrowly for literary fictional narratives as a literary technique literary device or fictional device is any of several specific methods the creator of a narrative uses to convey what they want 1 in other words a strategy used in the making of a narrative to relay information to the audience and particularly to develop the narrative usually in order to make it more complete complicated or interesting Literary techniques are distinguished from literary elements which exist inherently in works of writing Contents 1 Setting 2 Plots 3 Perspective 4 Style 5 Theme 6 Character 7 References Setting edit Name Definition Example Setting The setting is both the time and geographic location within a narrative or within a work of fiction A literary element the setting initiates the main backdrop and mood of a story often referred to as the story world The novel Ulysses by James Joyce is set in Dublin Ireland the action taking place on a single day 16 June 1904 The action of the novel takes place from one side of Dublin Bay to the other opening in Sandycove to the South of the city and closing on Howth Head to the North While the novel parallels the story of Odysseus the hero of Homer s epic poem Odyssey whose role is carried by Leopold Bloom much of the setting is described realistically with great attention to detail The locations within Dublin also represent locations in the Odyssey Blooms home is at 7 Eccles Street and at the same time Ithaca the home of Odysseus The Post office Westland Row and Swenys pharmacy in Lombard Street represent the Dublin location for Episode 5 Lotus Eaters the National Library of Ireland parallels Episode 9 Scylla and Charybdis and so on Plots edit Name Definition Example Backstory Story that precedes events in the story being toldpast events or background that add meaning to current circumstances Though The Lord of the Rings trilogy takes place in a relatively short period towards the end of the 3021year Third Age the narration gives glimpses of the mythological and historical events which took place earlier in the Third age leading up to the action in the novel and in the First and Second Age Cliffhanger The narrative ends unresolved to draw the audience back to a future episode for the resolution Almost every episode of the TV shows like Dexter and Breaking Bad 2 ends with one of the characters in a predicament about to be caught by thugs about to be exposed by the authorities or a family member or a friend finds out the main characters dirty secret Deus ex machina a machination or act of god lit god out of the machine Resolving the primary conflict by a means unrelated to the story eg a god appears and solves everything This device dates back to ancient Greek theater but can be a clumsy method that frustrates the audience The phrase originates from Medea an ancient Greek drama An example occurs in Mighty Aphrodite and the Tamil movie Inga Enna Solluthu Eucatastrophe Coined by J R R Tolkien a climactic event through which the protagonist appears to be facing a catastrophic change However this change does not materialize and the protagonist finds himself as the benefactor of such a climactic event contrast peripety peripateia At the end of The Lord of the Rings Gollum forcibly takes away the Ring from Frodo suggesting that Sauron would eventually take over Middle Earth However Gollum celebrates too eagerly and clumsily falls into the lava whereby the ring is destroyed and with it Saurons power In a way Gollum does what Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring intended to do through the whole plot of the trilogy which was to throw the ring into the lake of fire in the heart of Mount Doom Flashback or analeptic reference General term for altering time sequences taking characters back to the beginning of the tale for instance The story of The Three Apples in Arabian Nights tale begins with the discovery of a young womans dead body After the murderer later reveals himself he narrates his reasons for the murder as a flashback of events leading up to the discovery of her dead body at the beginning of the story Flashforward Also called prolepsis a scene that temporarily jumps the narrative forward in time Flashforwards often represent events expected projected or imagined to occur in the future They may also reveal significant parts of the story that have not yet occurred but soon will in greater detail Occurs in A Christmas Carol when Mr Scrooge visits the ghost of the future It is also frequent in the later seasons of the television series Lost Foreshadowing Implicit yet intentional efforts of an author to suggest events which have yet to take place in the process of narration See also repetitive designation and Chekhovs gun A narration might begin with a male character who has to break up a schoolyard fight among some boys who are vying for the attention of a girl which was introduced to foreshadow the events leading to a dinner time squabble between the character and his twin brother over a woman whom both are courting at the same time Frame story or a story within a story A main story that hatches a linking series of shorter stories Early examples include Panchatantra Kalila and Dimna Arabian Nights and The Decameron More modern examples are Brian Jacques s 1999 The Legend of Luke and Ramsay Wood s 2011 Kalila and Dimna update subtitled Fables of Conflict and Intrigue Framing device A single action scene event setting or any element of significance at the beginning and end of a work The use of framing devices allows frame stories to exist In Arabian Nights Scheherazade the newly wed wife to the King is the framing device As a character she is telling the 1001 stories to the King in order to delay her execution night by night However as a framing device her purpose for existing is to tell the same 1001 stories to the reader MacGuffin A plot device coined by Alfred Hitchcock referring to some goal desired object or other motivator that the protagonist pursues often with little or no narrative explanation as to why it is considered so important The Maltese Falcon is a powerful MacGuffin in the film of the same name a supposedly jewel encrusted black bird which creates the greed which propels every character even the hero In medias res Beginning the story in the middle of a sequence of events A specific form of narrative hook The Iliad and the Odyssey of Homer are prime examples The latter work begins with the return of Odysseus to his home of Ithaka and then in flashbacks tells of his ten years of wandering following the Trojan War Narrative hook Story opening that hooks readers attention so they will keep reading Any nonfiction book is often introduced with an interesting factoid Ochi A sudden interruption of the wordplay flow indicating the end of a rakugo or a kobanashi A Rakugo is a Japanese verbal entertainment usually lasting 30 minutes which ends with a surprise punch line a narrative stunt known as ochi fall or sagelowering Twelve kinds of ochi are codified and recognized The earlier kobanashi was a short comical vignette ending with an ochi Plot twist Unexpected change twist in the direction or expected outcome of the plot See also twist ending An early example is the Arabian Nights tale The Three Apples A locked chest found by a fisherman contains a dead body and two different men claim to be the murderer which turns out to be the investigators own slave Poetic justice Virtue ultimately rewarded or vice punished by an ironic twist of fate related to the characters own conduct Wile E Coyote coming up with a contraption to catch the Road Runner only to be foiled and caught by his own devices Each sins punishment in Dantes Inferno is a symbolic instance of poetic justice Predestination paradox Time travel paradox where a time traveler is caught in a loop of events that predestines them to travel back in time In Doctor Who the main character repeatedly finds himself under the obligation of having to travel back in time because of something his future character has done Quibble Plot device based on an argument that an agreements intended meaning holds no legal value and that only the exact literal words agreed on apply For example William Shakespeare used a quibble in The Merchant of Venice Portia saves Antonio in a court of law by pointing out that the agreement called for a pound of flesh but no blood so Shylock can collect only if he sheds no blood Red herring Diverting attention away from an item of significance For example in mystery fiction an innocent party may be purposefully cast as highly suspicious through emphasis or descriptive techniques to divert attention from the true guilty party Selffulfilling prophecy Prediction that by being made makes itself come true Early examples include the legend of Oedipus and the story of Krishna in the Mahabharata There is also an example of this in Harry Potter when Lord Voldemort heard a prophecy made by Sybill Trelawney to Dumbledore that a boy born at the end of July whose parents had defied Voldemort thrice and survived would be made marked as his equal Because of this prophecy Lord Voldemort sought out Harry Potter believing him to be the boy spoken of and tried to kill him His parents died protecting him and when Voldemort tried to cast a killing curse on Harry it rebounded and took away most of his strength and gave Harry Potter a unique ability and connection with the Dark Lord thus marking him as his equal Story within a story Hypodiegesis A story told within another story See also frame story In Stephen Kings The Wind Through the Keyhole of the Dark Tower series the protagonist tells a story from his past to his companions and in this story he tells another relatively unrelated story Ticking clock scenario Threat of impending disasteroften used in thrillers where salvation and escape are essential elements In the TV show 24 the main character Jack Bauer often finds himself interrogating a terrorist who is caught in order to disarm a bomb Chekhovs gun A dramatic principle that requires every element in a narrative to be irreplaceable with anything else removed Remove everything that has no relevance to the story If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off If its not going to be fired it shouldnt be hanging there Anton Chekhov Unreliable narrator The narrator of the story is not sincere or introduces a bias in their narration and possibly misleads the reader hiding or minimizing events characters or motivations An example is The Murder of Roger Ackroyd The novel includes an unexpected plot twist at the end of the novel In the last chapter Sheppard describes how he was an unreliable narrator Perspective edit Name Definition Example Audience surrogate A character who expresses the questions and confusion of the audience with whom the audience can identify Frequently used in detective fiction and science fiction where the character asks a central character how he or she accomplished certain deeds for the purpose of inciting that character to explain for the curious audience his or her methods or a character asking a relatively educated person to explain what amounts to the backstory Dr Watson in the Sherlock Holmes stories Scott Evil played by Seth Green son of Dr Evil on the Austin Powers movies Author surrogate Characters which are based on authors usually to support their personal views Sometimes an intentionally or unintentionally idealized version of them A variation is the Mary Sue or Gary Stu which primarily serves as an idealized selfinsertion Socrates in the writings of Plato Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues In the Second Letter it says no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new Breaking the fourth wall An author or character addresses the audience directly also known as direct address This may acknowledge to the reader or audience that what is being presented is fiction or may seek to extend the world of the story to provide the illusion that they are included in it The characters in Sesame Street often break the fourth wall when they address their viewers as part of the ongoing storyline which is possible because of the high level of suspension of belief afforded by its audiencechildren The American political drama show House of Cards also uses this technique frequently to let the viewers know what the main character Frank Underwood is thinking and planning Defamiliarization Taking an everyday object and presenting it in a way that is weirdly unfamiliar so that we see the object in a new way Coined by the early 20thcentury Russian literary critic Viktor Shklovsky in Art as Technique In Swifts Gullivers Travels when Gulliver visits the land of the giants and sees a giant womans skin he sees it is anything but smooth and beautiful when viewed up close 3 Firstperson narration A text presented from the point of view of a character especially the protagonist as if the character is telling the story themselves Breaking the fourth wall is an option but not a necessity of this format Mark Twain s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn uses the title character as the narrator while Sherlock Holmes is primarily told from Watsons perspective The film The Wolf of Wall Street uses this technique where the protagonist narrates the films events throughout providing clarity that could not be gained from the picture and dialogue alone Magical realism Describing events in a realworld setting but with magical trappings often incorporating local customs and invented beliefs Different from urban fantasy in that the magic itself is not the focus of the story Particularly popular with Latin American authors like Gabriel García Márquez and Jorge Luis Borges Elsewhere Salman Rushdies work provides good examples Multiperspectivity A narrative that is told from the viewpoints of multiple characters that incorporate various perspectives emotions and views from witnesses or actors to varying particular events or circumstances that might not be felt by other characters in the story The films of Robert Altman 2666 by Roberto Bolano features European literary critics a Chilean philosophy professor an AfricanAmerican journalist detectives investigating Santa Teresa murders and an obscure German writer named Benno Von Archimboldi Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov features literature professor John Shade Charles Kinbote a neighbor and colleague of Shades and Charles the Beloved king of Zembla Kinbote is the ultimate unreliable commentator Secondperson narration A text written in the style of a direct address in the secondperson Homestuck Stream of consciousness The author uses narrative and stylistic devices to create the sense of an unedited interior monologue characterized by leaps in syntax and punctuation that trace a characters fragmentary thoughts and sensory feelings The outcome is a highly lucid perspective with a plot Not to be confused with free writing An example is Ulysses At one point Leopold Bloom saunters through Dublin musing on Pineapple rock lemon platt butter scotch A sugarsticky girl shovelling scoopful of creams for a Christian brother Some school treat Bad for their tummies Thirdperson narration A text written as if by an impersonal narrator who is not affected by the events in the story Can be omniscient or limited the latter usually being tied to a specific character a group of characters or a location A Song of Ice and Fire is written in multiple limited thirdperson narrators that change with each chapter The Master and Margarita uses an omniscient narrator Style edit See also Figure of speech Name Definition Example Allegory Symbolic fiction as presented in a story C S Lewiss The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a religious allegory with Aslan as Christ and Edmund as Judas 4 Alliteration Repeating the same letter or consonant sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words In the film V for Vendetta the main character performs a couple of soliloquies with a heavy use of alliteration eg Voilà In view a humble vaudevillian veteran cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate This visage no mere veneer of vanity is a vestige of the vox populi now vacant vanished as the once vital voice of the verisimilitude now venerates what they once vilified However this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition The only verdict is vengeance a vendetta held as a votive not in vain for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous Verily this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose visàvis an introduction and so it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V Amplification rhetoric Amplification refers to a literary practice wherein the writer embellishes the sentence by adding more information to it in order to increase its worth and understanding Eg Original sentence The thesis paper was difficult After amplification The thesis paper was difficult it required extensive research data collection sample surveys interviews and a lot of fieldwork Anagram Rearranging the letters of a word or a phrase to form a new phrase or word Eg An anagram for debit card is bad credit As you can see both phrases use the same letters By mixing the letters a bit of humor is created Asyndeton When sentences do not use conjunctions eg and or nor to separate clauses but run clauses into one another usually marking the separation of clauses with punctuation An example is when John F Kennedy said on January 20 1961 that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty Bathos An abrupt transition in style from the exalted to the commonplace producing a ludicrous effect While often unintended bathos may be used deliberately to produce a humorous effect 5 6 The ballerina rose gracefully en pointe and extended one slender leg behind her like a dog at a fire hydrant Jennifer Hart Arlington 7 Caesura A break especially a sense pause usually near the middle of a verse and marked in scansion by a double vertical line This technique frequently occurs within a poetic line grammatically connected to the end of the previous line by enjambment Eg in Know then thyself Presume not God to scan Distancing effect Deliberately preventing the audience from identifying with characters in order to let them be coolly scrutinized 8 Popularized by 20th century playwright Bertolt Brecht Dramatic visualization Representing an object or character with abundant descriptive detail or mimetically rendering gestures and dialogue to make a scene more visual or imaginatively present to an audience This technique appears at least as far back as the Arabian Nights 9 Euphuism An artificial highly elaborate way of writing or speaking Named from Euphues 1579 the prose romance by John Lyly Is it not far better to abhor sins by the remembrance of others faults than by repentance of thine own follies Euphues 1 lecture by the wise Neapolitan Hyperbole Exaggeration used to evoke strong feelings or create an impression which is not meant to be taken literally Sally could no longer hide her secret Her pregnant belly was bigger than the planet on which she stood Imagery Forming mental images of a scene using descriptive words especially making use of the human senses The same as sensory detail When the boots came off his feet with a leathery squeak a smell of ferment and fish market immediately filled the small tent The skin of his toes were red and raw and sensitive The malodorous air was so toxic he thought he could almost taste his toes Leitwortstil Purposefully repeating words that usually express a motif or theme important to the story This dates back at least to the Arabian Nights 10 Metonymy Word or phrase in a figure of speech in which a noun is referenced by something closely associated with it rather than explicitly by the noun itself This is not to be confused with synecdoche in which a part of the whole stands for the thing itself Metonomy The boxer threw in the towel Synecdoche She gave her hand in marriage Overstatement Exaggerating something often for emphasis also known as hyperbole Sallys pregnant belly most likely weighed as much as the scooter she used to ride before she got pregnant Onomatopoeia Words that imitatespell a sound or noise Word that sounds the same as or similar to what the word means Boom goes the dynamite Bang Bark comic books Oxymoron A term made of two words that deliberately or coincidentally imply each others opposite terrible beauty Paradox A phrase that describes an idea composed of concepts that conflict It was the best of times it was the worst of times A Tale of Two Cities Parody Ridicule by overstated imitation usually humorous MAD Magazine Pastiche Using forms and styles from another author generally as an affectionate tribute Such as the many stories featuring Sherlock Holmes not written by Arthur Conan Doyle or much of the Cthulhu Mythos Pathos Emotional appeal one of the three modes of persuasion in rhetoric that the author uses to inspire pity or sorrow towards a charactertypically does not counterbalance the target characters suffering with a positive outcome as in Tragedy In Romeo and Juliet the two main characters each commit suicide at the sight of the supposedly dead lover however the audience knows these actions to be rash and unnecessary Therefore Shakespeare makes for the emotional appeal for the unnecessary tragedy behind the young characters rash interpretations about love and life Polyptoton Words derived from the same root in a sentence Not as a call to battle though embattled we are John F Kennedy Inaugural Address January 20 1961 Polysyndeton Polysyndeton is the use of several conjunctions in close succession this provides a sense of exaggeration designed to wear down the audience An example of this is in the first chapter of Great Expectations by Charles Dickens A man who had been soaked in water and smothered in mud and lamed by stones and cut by flints and stung by nettles and torn by briars who limped and shivered and glared and growled and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin Satire The use of humor irony or exaggeration to criticize An example is Network One of the earliest examples is Gullivers Travels written by Jonathan Swift The television program South Park is another Sensory detail sight sound taste touch smell The same as imagery The boot was tough and sinewy between his hardbiting teeth There was no flavor to speak of except for the blandness of all the dirt that the boot had soaked up over the years The only thing the boot reminded him of was the smell of a wetdog Understatement A diminishing or softening of a theme or effect The broken ends of the long bone were sticking through the bleeding skin but it wasnt something that always killed a man Theme edit Name Definition Example Irony This discrepancy between expectation and reality occurs in three forms situational irony where a situation features a discrepancy between what is expected and what is actualized dramatic irony where a character is unaware of pivotal information already revealed to the audience the discrepancy here lies in the two levels of awareness between the character and the audience and verbal irony where one states one thing while meaning another The difference between verbal irony and sarcasm is exquisitely subtle and often contested The concept of irony is too often misunderstood in popular usage Unfortunate circumstances and coincidences do not constitute irony nor do they qualify as being tragic See the Usage controversy section under irony and the term tragedy A person hears a prophecy about himself His endeavor to stop the prophecy from coming true makes it come true Metaphor Evoking imagination by means of using figurative language Her tears were a river flowing down her cheeks Thematic patterning Distributing recurrent thematic concepts and moralistic motifs among various incidents and frames of a story In a skillfully crafted tale thematic patterning may emphasize the unifying argument or salient idea disparate events and disparate frames have in common Each of the chapters of Ulysses by James Joyce Character edit Name Type Notes Anthropomorphism Form of personification that applies humanlike characteristics to animals The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi or the Cheshire Cat of Alices Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll Hamartia The character flaw of an initially rich and powerful hero that leads to his tragic downfall This is also referred to as the tragic flaw Oedipus kills his own father because he doesnt understand his true parentage Pathetic fallacy Reflecting a characters usually the protagonist mood in the atmosphere or inanimate objects Related to anthropomorphism and projection For example the storm in William Shakespeare s King Lear which mirrors Lears mental deterioration Personification Using comparative metaphors and similes to give characteristics to abstract concepts Taken from Act I Scene II of Romeo and Juliet When wellappareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads 11 References edit Orehovec Barbara 2003 Revisiting the Reading Workshop A Complete Guide to Organizing and Managing an Effective Reading Workshop That Builds Independent Strategic
