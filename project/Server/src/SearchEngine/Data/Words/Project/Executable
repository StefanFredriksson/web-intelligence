code or an executable file or executable program sometimes simply referred to as an executable causes a computer to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions 1 as opposed to a data file that must be parsed by a program to be meaningful The exact interpretation depends upon the use Instructions is traditionally taken to mean machine code instructions for a physical CPU 2 in some contexts a file containing bytecode or scripting language instructions may also be considered executable Contents 1 Generation of executable files 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Generation of executable files edit See also Object file Executable files can be handcoded in machine language although it is far more convenient to develop software as source code in a highlevel language that can be easily understood by humans In some cases source code might be specified in assembly language instead which remains humanreadable while being closely associated with machine code instructions The highlevel language is compiled into either an executable machine code file or a nonexecutable machinecode object file of some sort the equivalent process on assembly language source code is called assembly Several object files are linked to create the executable Object files executable or not are typically in a container format such as Executable and Linkable Format ELF 3 This structures then generated machine code for example dividing it into sections such as the text executable code data static variables and rodata static constants In order to be executed by the system such as an operating system firmware or boot loader an executable file must conform to the systems application binary interface ABI 4 Most simply a file is executed by loading the file into memory and simply jumping to the start of the address space and executing from there but in more complicated interfaces executable files have additional metadata specifying a separate entry point For example in ELF the entry point is specified in the header in the eentry field which specifies the virtual memory address at which to start execution In the GCC GNU Compiler Collection this field is set by the linker based on the start symbol Executable files typically also include a runtime system which implements runtime language features such as task scheduling exception handling calling static constructors and destructors etc and interactions with the operating system notably passing arguments environment and returning an exit status together with other startup and shutdown features such as releasing resources like file handles For C this is done by linking in the crt0 object which contains the actual entry point and does setup and shutdown by calling the runtime library 5 Executable files thus normally contain significant additional machine code beyond that directly generated from the specific source code In some cases it is desirable to omit this for example for embedded systems development or simply to understand how compilation linking and loading work In C this can be done by omitting the usual runtime and instead explicitly specifying a linker script which generates the entry point and handles startup and shutdown such as calling main to start and returning exit status to kernel at end 6 See also edit Comparison of executable file formats References edit executable
