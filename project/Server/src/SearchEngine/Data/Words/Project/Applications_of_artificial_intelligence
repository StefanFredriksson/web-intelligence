and social challenges For example the University of Southern California launched the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society with the goal of using AI to address socially relevant problems such as homelessness At Stanford researchers are using AI to analyze satellite images to identify which areas have the highest poverty levels 1 Agriculture edit See also Precision agriculture See also Digital agriculture In agriculture new AI advancements show improvements in gaining yield and to increase the research and development of growing crops New artificial intelligence now predicts the time it takes for a crop like a tomato to be ripe and ready for picking thus increasing efficiency of farming 2 These advances go on including Crop and Soil Monitoring Agricultural Robots and Predictive Analytics Crop and soil monitoring uses new algorithms and data collected on the field to manage and track the health of crops making it easier and more sustainable for the farmers 3 More specializations of AI in agriculture is one such as greenhouse automation simulation modeling and optimization techniques Due to the increase in population and the growth of demand for food in the future there will need to be at least a 70 increase in yield from agriculture to sustain this new demand More and more of the public perceives that the adaption of these new techniques and the use of Artificial intelligence will help reach that goal 4 Aviation edit This section needs additional citations for verification Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources

message The Air Operations Division AOD uses AI for the rule based expert systems The AOD has use for artificial intelligence for surrogate operators for combat and training simulators mission management aids support systems for tactical decision making and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries 5 The use of artificial intelligence in simulators is proving to be very useful for the AOD Airplane simulators are using artificial intelligence in order to process the data taken from simulated flights Other than simulated flying there is also simulated aircraft warfare The computers are able to come up with the best success scenarios in these situations The computers can also create strategies based on the placement size speed and strength of the forces and counter forces Pilots may be given assistance in the air during combat by computers The artificial intelligent programs can sort the information and provide the pilot with the best possible maneuvers not to mention getting rid of certain maneuvers that would be impossible for a human being to perform Multiple aircraft are needed to get good approximations for some calculations so computer simulated pilots are used to gather data 6 These computer simulated pilots are also used to train future air traffic controllers The system used by the AOD in order to measure performance was the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System or IFDIS It is a rule based expert system put together by collecting information from TF30 documents and the expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF30 This system was designed to be used for the development of the TF30 for the RAAF F111C The performance system was also used to replace specialized workers The system allowed the regular workers to communicate with the system and avoid mistakes miscalculations or having to speak to one of the specialized workers The AOD also uses artificial intelligence in speech recognition software The air traffic controllers are giving directions to the artificial pilots and the AOD wants to the pilots to respond to the ATCs with simple responses The programs that incorporate the speech software must be trained which means they use neural networks The program used the Verbex 7000 is still a very early program that has plenty of room for improvement The improvements are imperative because ATCs use very specific dialog and the software needs to be able to communicate correctly and promptly every time The Artificial Intelligence supported Design of Aircraft 7 or AIDA is used to help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft This program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the design process The software also allows the user to focus less on the software tools The AIDA uses rule based systems to compute its data This is a diagram of the arrangement of the AIDA modules Although simple the program is proving effective In 2003 NASA s Dryden Flight Research Center and many other companies created software that could enable a damaged aircraft to continue flight until a safe landing zone can be reached 8 The software compensates for all the damaged components by relying on the undamaged components The neural network used in the software proved to be effective and marked a triumph for artificial intelligence The Integrated Vehicle Health Management system also used by NASA on board an aircraft must process and interpret data taken from the various sensors on the aircraft The system needs to be able to determine the structural integrity of the aircraft The system also needs to implement protocols in case of any damage taken the vehicle 9 Haitham Baomar and Peter Bentley are leading a team from the University College of London to develop an artificial intelligence based Intelligent Autopilot System IAS designed to teach an autopilot system to behave like a highly experienced pilot who is faced with an emergency situation such as severe weather turbulence or system failure 10 Educating the autopilot relies on the concept of supervised machine learning which treats the young autopilot as a human apprentice going to a flying school 10 The autopilot records the actions of the human pilot generating learning models using artificial neural networks 10 The autopilot is then given full control and observed by the pilot as it executes the training exercise 10 The Intelligent Autopilot System combines the principles of Apprenticeship Learning and Behavioural Cloning whereby the autopilot observes the lowlevel actions required to maneuver the airplane and highlevel strategy used to apply those actions 11 IAS implementation employs three phases pilot data collection training and autonomous control 11 Baomar and Bentleys goal is to create a more autonomous autopilot to assist pilots in responding to emergency situations 11 Computer science edit AI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science Many of their inventions have been adopted by mainstream computer science and are no longer considered a part of AI See AI effect According to Russell Norvig 2003 p15 all of the following were originally developed in AI laboratories time sharing interactive interpreters graphical user interfaces and the computer mouse Rapid application development environmentsthe linked list data structure automatic storage management symbolic programming functional programming dynamic programming and objectoriented programming AI can be used to potentially determine the developer of anonymous binaries citation needed AI can be used to create other AI For example around November 2017 Googles AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created NASNet a system optimized for ImageNet and COCO According to Google NASNets performance exceeded all previously published ImageNet performance 12 Deepfake edit In June 2016 a research team from the visual computing group of the Technical University of Munich and from Stanford University developed Face2Face 13 a program which animates the face of a target person transposing the facial expressions of an exterior source The technology has been demonstrated animating the lips of people including Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin Since then other methods have been demonstrated based on deep neural network from which the name deepfake was taken Hollywood film studios had already used the technique in animated films which but it took time and efforts from professionals The main difference is that today anyone can use a deep fake software and rig videos citation needed In September 2018 the US Senator Mark Warner proposed to penalize social media companies that allow sharing of deepfake documents on their platform 14 Vincent Nozick a researcher from the Institut Gaspard Monge found a way to detect rigged documents by analyzing the movements of the eyelid citation needed The DARPA a research group associated with the US Department of Defense has given 68 million dollars to work on deepfake detection citation needed In Europe the Horizon 2020 program financed InVid software designed to help journalists to detect fake documents citation needed Education edit AI tutors could allow for students to get extra oneonone help They could also reduce anxiety and stress for some students that may be caused by tutor labs or human tutors 15 In future classrooms ambient informatics can play a beneficial role Ambient informatics is the idea that information is everywhere in the environment and that technologies automatically adjust to your personal preferences 16 Study devices could be able to create lessons problems and games to tailor to the specific students needs and give immediate feedback But AI can also create a disadvantageous environment with revenge effects if technology is inhibiting society from moving forward and causing negative unintended effects on society 17 An example of a revenge effect is that the extended use of technology may hinder students ability to focus and stay on task instead of helping them learn and grow 18 Also AI has been known to lead to the loss of both human agency and simultaneity 16 Finance edit Algorithmic trading edit Algorithmic trading involves the use of complex AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds several orders of magnitudes greater than any human is capable of often making millions of trades in a day without any human intervention Such trading is called Highfrequency Trading and it represents one of the fastest growing sectors in financial trading Many banks funds and proprietary trading firms now have entire portfolios which are managed purely by AI systems Automated trading systems are typically used by large institutional investors but recent years have also seen an influx of smaller proprietary firms trading with their own AI systems 19 Market analysis and data mining edit Several large financial institutions have invested in AI engines to assist with their investment practices BlackRock s AI engine Aladdin is used both within the company and to clients to help with investment decisions Its wide range of functionalities includes the use of natural language processing to read text such as news broker reports and social media feeds It then gauges the sentiment on the companies mentioned and assigns a score Banks such as UBS and Deutsche Bank use an AI engine called Sqreem Sequential Quantum Reduction and Extraction Model which can mine data to develop consumer profiles and match them with the wealth management products theyd most likely want 20 Goldman Sachs uses Kensho a market analytics platform that combines statistical computing with big data and natural language processing Its machine learning systems mine through hoards of data on the web and assess correlations between world events and their impact on asset prices 21 Information Extraction part of artificial intelligence is used to extract information from live news feed and to assist with investment decisions 22 Personal finance edit Several products are emerging that utilize AI to assist people with their personal finances For example Digit is an app powered by artificial intelligence that automatically helps consumers optimize their spending and savings based on their own personal habits and goals The app can analyze factors such as monthly income current balance and spending habits then make its own decisions and transfer money to the savings account 23 WalletAI an upcoming startup in San Francisco builds agents that analyze data that a consumer would leave behind from Smartphone checkins to tweets to inform the consumer about their spending behavior 24 Portfolio management edit Roboadvisors are becoming more widely used in the investment management industry Roboadvisors provide financial advice and portfolio management with minimal human intervention This class of financial advisers work based on algorithms built to automatically develop a financial portfolio according to the investment goals and risk tolerance of the clients It can adjust to realtime changes in the market and accordingly calibrate the portfolio 25 Underwriting edit An online lender Upstart analyze vast amounts of consumer data and utilizes machine learning algorithms to develop credit risk models that predict a consumers likelihood of default Their technology will be licensed to banks for them to leverage for their underwriting processes as well 26 ZestFinance developed their Zest Automated Machine Learning ZAML Platform specifically for credit underwriting as well This platform utilizes machine learning to analyze tens of thousands traditional and nontraditional variables from purchase transactions to how a customer fills out a form used in the credit industry to score borrowers The platform is particularly useful to assign credit scores to those with limited credit histories such as millennials 27 History edit The 1980s is really when AI started to become prominent in the finance world This is when expert systems became more of a commercial product in the financial field For example Dupont had built 100 expert systems which helped them save close to 10 million a year 28 One of the first systems was the Protrader expert system designed by KC Chen and Tingpeng Lian that was able to predict the 87point drop in DOW Jones Industrial Average in 1986 The major junctions of the system were to monitor premiums in the market determine the optimum investment strategy execute transactions when appropriate and modify the knowledge base through a learning mechanism 29 One of the first expert systems that helped with financial plans was created by Applied Expert Systems APEX called the PlanPower It was first commercially shipped in 1986 Its function was to help give financial plans for people with incomes over 75000 a year That then led to the Client Profiling System that was used for incomes between 25000 and 200000 a year 30 The 1990s was a lot more about fraud detection One of the systems that was started in 1993 was the FinCEN Artificial Intelligence system FAIS It was able to review over 200000 transactions per week and over two years it helped identify 400 potential cases of money laundering which would have been equal to 1 billion 31 Although expert systems did not last in the finance world it did help jumpstart the use of AI and help make it what it is today citation needed Government edit Main article Artificial intelligence in government Heavy industry edit Main article Artificial intelligence in heavy industry Robots have become common in many industries and are often given jobs that are considered dangerous to humans Robots have proven effective in jobs that are very repetitive which may lead to mistakes or accidents due to a lapse in concentration and other jobs which humans may find degrading In 2014 China Japan the United States the Republic of Korea and Germany together amounted to 70 of the total sales volume of robots In the automotive industry a sector with particularly high degree of automation Japan had the highest density of industrial robots in the world 1414 per 10000 employees 32 Hospitals and medicine edit Xray of a hand with automatic calculation of bone age

by the FDA 38 Human resources and recruiting edit Another application of AI is in the human resources and recruiting space There are three ways AI is being used by human resources and recruiting professionals to screen resumes and rank candidates according to their level of qualification to predict candidate success in given roles through job matching platforms and rolling out recruiting chat bots that can automate repetitive communication tasks citation needed Typically resume screening involves a recruiter or other HR professional scanning through a database of resumes Job search edit The job market has seen a notable change due to artificial intelligence implementation It has simplified the process for both recruiters and job seekers ie Google for Jobs and applying online According to Raj Mukherjee from Indeedcom 65 of people launch a job search again within 91 days of being hired AIpowered engine streamlines the complexity of job hunting by operating information on job skills salaries and user tendencies matching people to the most relevant positions Machine intelligence calculates what wages would be appropriate for a particular job pulls and highlights resume information for recruiters using natural language processing which extracts relevant words and phrases from text using specialized software Another application is an AI resume builder which requires 5 minutes to compile a CV as opposed to spending hours doing the same job citation needed In the AI age chatbots assist website visitors and solve daily workflows Revolutionary AI tools complement peoples skills and allow HR managers to focus on tasks of higher priority However Artificial Intelligence impact on jobs research suggests that by 2030 intelligent agents and robots can eliminate 30 of the worlds human labor Moreover the research proves automation will displace between 400 and 800 million employees Glassdoors research report states that recruiting and HR are expected to see much broader adoption of AI in job market 2018 and beyond 39 40 Marketing edit Main article Marketing and artificial intelligence Media and ecommerce edit Some AI applications are geared towards the analysis of audiovisual media content such as movies TV programs advertisement videos or usergenerated content The solutions often involve computer vision which is a major application area of AI Typical use case scenarios include the analysis of images using object recognition or face recognition techniques or the analysis of video for recognizing relevant scenes objects or faces The motivation for using AIbased media analysis can be among other things the facilitation of media search the creation of a set of descriptive keywords for a media item media content policy monitoring such as verifying the suitability of content for a particular TV viewing time speech to text for archival or other purposes and the detection of logos products or celebrity faces for the placement of relevant advertisements Media analysis AI companies often provide their services over a REST API that enables machinebased automatic access to the technology and allows machinereading of the results For example IBM Microsoft Amazon and the video AI company Valossa 41 allow access to their media recognition technology by using RESTful APIs AI is also widely used in Ecommerce applications like visual search chatbots and automated product tagging citation needed Another generic application is to increase search discoverability and making social media content shoppable citation needed Military edit Further information Artificial intelligence arms race Lethal autonomous weapon and Unmanned combat aerial vehicle The main military applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine

detection and identification marking of enemy positions target acquisition coordination and deconfliction of distributed Join Fires between networked combat vehicles and tanks also inside Manned and Unmanned Teams MUMT 42 Music edit Main article Music and artificial intelligence While the evolution of music has always been affected by technology artificial intelligence has enabled through scientific advances to emulate at some extent humanlike composition Among notable early efforts David Cope created an AI called Emily Howell that managed to become well known in the field of Algorithmic Computer Music 43 The algorithm behind Emily Howell is registered as a US patent 44 The AI Iamus created 2012 the first complete classical album fully composed by a computer Other endeavours like AIVA Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist focus on composing symphonic music mainly classical music for film scores 45 It achieved a world first by becoming the first virtual composer to be recognized by a musical professional association 46 Artificial intelligences can even produce music usable in a medical setting with Melomics s effort to use computergenerated music for stress and pain relief 47 Moreover initiatives such as Google Magenta conducted by the Google Brain team want to find out if an artificial intelligence can be capable of creating compelling art 48 At Sony CSL Research Laboratory their Flow Machines software has created pop songs by learning music styles from a huge database of songs By analyzing unique combinations of styles and optimizing techniques it can compose in any style Another artificial intelligence musical composition project The Watson Beat written by IBM Research doesnt need a huge database of music like the Google Magenta and Flow Machines projects since it uses Reinforcement Learning and Deep Belief Networks to compose music on a simple seed input melody and a select style Since the software has been open sourced 49 musicians such as Taryn Southern 50 have been collaborating with the project to create music News publishing and writing edit The company Narrative Science makes computergenerated news and reports commercially available including summarizing team sporting events based on statistical data from the game in English It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses 51 Similarly the company Automated Insights generates personalized recaps and previews for Yahoo Sports Fantasy Football 52 The company is projected to generate one billion stories in 2014 up from 350 million in 2013 53 The organisation OpenAI has also created an AI capable of writing text 54 Echobox is a software company that helps publishers increase traffic by intelligently posting articles on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter 55 By analysing large amounts of data it learns how specific audiences respond to different articles at different times of the day It then chooses the best stories to post and the best times to post them It uses both historical and realtime data to understand to what has worked well in the past as well as what is currently trending on the web 56 Another company called Yseop uses artificial intelligence to turn structured data into intelligent comments and recommendations in natural language Yseop is able to write financial reports executive summaries personalized sales or marketing documents and more at a speed of thousands of pages per second and in multiple languages including English Spanish French German 57 Boomtrains is another example of AI that is designed to learn how to best engage each individual reader with the exact articlessent through the right channel at the right timethat will be most relevant to the reader Its like hiring a personal editor for each individual reader to curate the perfect reading experience IRISTV is helping media companies with its AIpowered video personalization and programming platform It allows publishers and content owners to surface contextually relevant content to audiences based on consumer viewing patterns 58 Beyond automation of writing tasks given data input AI has shown significant potential for computers to engage in higherlevel creative work AI Storytelling has been an active field of research since James Meehans development of TALESPIN which made up stories similar to the fables of Aesop The program would start with a set of characters who wanted to achieve certain goals with the story as a narration of the characters attempts at executing plans to satisfy these goals 59 Since Meehan other researchers have worked on AI Storytelling using similar or different approaches Mark Riedl and Vadim Bulitko argued that the essence of storytelling was an experience management problem or how to balance the need for a coherent story progression with user agency which are often at odds 60 While most research on AI storytelling has focused on story generation eg character and plot there has also been significant investigation in story communication In 2002 researchers at North Carolina State University developed an architectural framework for narrative prose generation Their particular implementation was able faithfully reproduced text variety and complexity of a number of stories such as red riding hood with humanlike adroitness 61 This particular field continues to gain interest In 2016 a Japanese AI cowrote a short story and almost won a literary prize 62 Online and telephone customer service edit An automated online assistant providing customer service on a web page Artificial intelligence is implemented in automated online assistants that can be seen as avatars on web pages 63 It can avail for enterprises to reduce their operation and training cost 63 A major underlying technology to such systems is natural language processing 63 Pypestream uses automated customer service for its mobile application designed to streamline communication with customers 64 Major companies are investing in AI to handle difficult customer in the future Googles most recent development analyzes language and converts speech into text The platform can identify angry customers through their language and respond appropriately 65 Power electronics edit Power electronics converters are an enabling technology for renewable energy energy storage electric vehicles and highvoltage direct current transmission systems within the electrical grid These converters are prone to failures and such failures can cause downtimes that may require costly maintenance or even have catastrophic consequences in mission critical applications citation needed Researchers are using AI to do the automated design process for reliable power electronics converters by calculating exact design parameters that ensure desired lifetime of the converter under specified mission profile 66 Sensors edit Artificial Intelligence has been combined with many sensor technologies such as Digital Spectrometry by IdeaCuria Inc 67 68 which enables many applications such as at home water quality monitoring Telecommunications maintenance edit Many telecommunications companies make use of heuristic search in the management of their workforces for example BT Group has deployed heuristic search 69 in a scheduling application that provides the work schedules of 20000 engineers Toys and games edit The 1990s saw some of the first attempts to massproduce domestically aimed types of basic Artificial Intelligence for education or leisure This prospered greatly with the Digital Revolution and helped introduce people especially children to a life of dealing with various types of Artificial Intelligence specifically in the form of Tamagotchis and Giga Pets iPod Touch the Internet and the first widely released robot Furby A mere year later an improved type of domestic robot was released in the form of Aibo a robotic dog with intelligent features and autonomy Companies like Mattel have been creating an assortment of AIenabled toys for kids as young as age three Using proprietary AI engines and speech recognition tools they are able to understand conversations give intelligent responses and learn quickly 70 AI has also been applied to video games for example video game bots which are designed to stand in as opponents where humans arent available or desired Transportation edit Fuzzy logic controllers have been developed for automatic gearboxes in automobiles For example the 2006 Audi TT VW Touareg citation needed and VW Caravell feature the DSP transmission which utilizes Fuzzy Logic A number of Škoda variants Škoda Fabia also currently include a Fuzzy Logicbased controller Todays cars now have AIbased driver assist features such as selfparking and advanced cruise controls AI has been used to optimize traffic management applications which in turn reduces wait times energy use and emissions by as much as 25 percent 1 In the future fully autonomous cars will be developed AI in transportation is expected to provide safe efficient and reliable transportation while minimizing the impact on the environment and communities The major challenge to developing this AI is the fact that transportation systems are inherently complex systems involving a very large number of components and different parties each having different and often conflicting objectives 71 Due to this high degree of complexity of the transportation and in particular the automotive application it is in most cases not possible to train an AI algorithm in a realworld driving environment To overcome the challenge of training neural networks for automated driving methodologies based on virtual development resp testing toolchains 72 have been proposed Wikipedia edit Studies related to Wikipedia has been using artificial intelligence to support various operations One of the most important areas automatic detection of vandalism 73 74 and data quality assessment in Wikipedia 75 76 The team at the
