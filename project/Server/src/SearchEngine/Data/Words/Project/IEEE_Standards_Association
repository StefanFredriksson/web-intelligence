Glossaries Artificial intelligence Computer science Electrical and electronics engineering v t e The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association IEEESA is an organization within IEEE that develops global standards in a broad range of industries including power and energy biomedical and health care information technology and robotics telecommunication and home automation transportation nanotechnology information assurance and many more IEEESA has developed standards for over a century through a program that offers balance openness fair procedures and consensus Technical experts from all over the world participate in the development of IEEE standards 1 IEEESA is not a body formally authorized by any government but rather a community ISO IEC and ITU are recognized international standards organizations ISO members are national standards bodies such as American ANSI German DIN or Japanese JISC IEC members are so called National Committees some of which are hosted by national standards bodies These are not identical to ISO members Both IEC and ISO develop International Standards that are consensusbased and follow the one country one vote principle representing broad industry needs Their standards cannot be sponsored by individual companies or organizations 2 The 20172018 Standards Association President is Mr Don Wright He is the President of Standards Strategies LLC and is the retired Director of Worldwide Standards for Lexmark International Contents 1 Standards 11 The standardization process 12 The patent policy 13 The IEEE Get Program 2 Notable IEEE Standards committees and formats 3 Awards 4 References 5 External links Standards edit The standardization process edit Each year the IEEESA conducts over 200 standards ballots a process by which proposed standards are voted upon for technical reliability and soundness In 2017 IEEE had over 1100 active standards with over 600 standards under development 3 One of the more notable are the IEEE 802 LAN MAN group of standards with the widely used computer networking standards for both wired ethernet aka IEEE 8023 and wireless IEEE 80211 and IEEE 80216 networks The IEEE standards development process can be broken down into seven basic steps Securing Sponsorship An IEEEapproved organization must sponsor a standard A sponsoring organization is in charge of coordinating and supervising the standard development from inception to completion The professional societies within IEEE serve as the natural sponsor for many standards Requesting Project Authorization To gain authorization for the standard a Project Authorization Request PAR is submitted to the IEEESA Standards Board The New Standards Committee NesCom of the IEEESA Standards Board reviews the PAR and makes a recommendation to the Standards Board about whether to approve the PAR Assembling a Working Group After the PAR is approved a working group of individuals affected by or interested in the standard is organized to develop the standard IEEESA rules ensure that all Working Group meetings are open and that anyone has the right to attend and contribute to the meetings Drafting the Standard The Working Group prepares a draft of the proposed standard Generally the draft follows the IEEE Standards Style Manual that sets guidelines for the clauses and format of the standards document Balloting Once a draft of the standard is finalized in the Working Group the draft is submitted for Balloting approval The IEEE Standards Department sends an invitationtoballot to any individual who has expressed an interest in the subject matter of the standard Anyone who responds positively to the invitationtoballot becomes a member of the balloting group as long as the individual is an IEEE Standards Association member or has paid a balloting fee The IEEE requires that a proposed draft of the standard receive a response rate of 75 ie at least 75 of potential ballots are returned and that of the responding ballots at least 75 approve the proposed draft of the standard If the standard is not approved the process returns to the drafting of the standard step in order to modify the standard document to gain approval of the balloting group Review Committee After getting 75 approval the draft standard along with the balloting comments are submitted to the IEEESA Standards Board Review Committee RevCom The RevCom reviews the proposed draft of the standard against the IEEESA Standards Board Bylaws and the stipulations set forth in the IEEESA Standards Board Operations Manual The RevCom then makes a recommendation about whether to approve the submitted draft of the standard document Final Vote Each member of the IEEESA Standards Board places a final vote on the submitted standard document In some cases external members are invited to vote It takes a majority vote of the Standards Board to gain final approval of the standard In general if the RevCom recommends approval the Standards Board will vote to approve the standard The patent policy edit Because the IEEEs standards often incorporate technologies that are covered by one or more patent claims the IEEESA has developed and added to its governing bylaws a patent policy to ensure both that the implementers using the standardessential patented technology in their standardcompliant products have access to that technology and that the patent holders that voluntarily contribute those technologies to the standard receive adequate compensation for the implementers use 4 5 An important part of the IEEE patent policy is the FRAND commitment which is a voluntary contractual commitment signifying that a patent holder with patented technology that has been adopted into one of the IEEEs standards will accept as adequate compensation a fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory royalty for thirdparty use of that technology 6 Most standardsetting organizations have developed similar patent policies with similar commitments 7 In 2014 the IEEESA became the center of a large academic debate among economic and legal scholars when it appointed an ad hoc committee to recommend and subsequently draft amendments to the IEEE patent policy to which the IEEE Board of Governors gave final approval in February 2015 and which went into effect in March 2015 8 The IEEE said that the reason for the amendments was to increase the clarity of the patent policy and the obligations that the patent policys FRAND commitment imposes on patent holders seeking to enforce their standardessential patents 9 One particularly controversial amendment was a provision that prohibited patent holders from seeking injunctions and exclusion orders from the ITC against infringers of standardessential patents The Antitrust Division stated its support for the 2015 patent policy revisions in a business review letter that it issued in January 2015 upon request from the IEEESA In the letter the Antitrust Division said that the provisions would unambiguously produce net benefits for consumers with insignificant anticompetitive implications 10 At least one commentator has criticized the Antitrust Divisions legal and economic analysis put forth in its business review letter of the revisions claiming that the Antitrust Division exaggerated the patent policys procompetitive benefits and wrongly dismissed as unlikely some of its potential anticompetitive costs 11 The IEEE Get Program edit The IEEE Get Program makes some standards publicly available for download This program grants public access to view and download current individual standards at zero charges On July 11 2017 the IEEE Get Program moved to the IEEE Xplore digital library website and standards eligible for the program past that date will only be made available there On September 1 2017 the original website was decommissioned and remains without further updates to redirect visitors 12 13 14 Notable IEEE
