using two dice Probability is a numerical description of how likely an event is to occur or how likely it is that a proposition is true Probability is a number between 0 and 1 where roughly speaking 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty note 1 1 2 The higher the probability of an event the more likely it is that the event will occur A simple example is the tossing of a fair unbiased coin Since the coin is fair the two outcomes heads and tails are both equally probable the probability of heads equals the probability of tails and since no other outcomes are possible the probability of either heads or tails is 12 which could also be written as 05 or 50 These concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory which is used widely in such areas of study as mathematics statistics finance gambling science in particular physics artificial intelligence machine learning computer science game theory and philosophy to for example draw inferences about the expected frequency of events Probability theory is also used to describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of complex systems 3 Contents 1 Interpretations 2 Etymology 3 History 4

interpretations When dealing with experiments that are random and welldefined in a purely theoretical setting like tossing a fair coin probabilities can be numerically described by the number of desired outcomes divided by the total number of all outcomes For example tossing a fair coin twice will yield headhead headtail tailhead and tailtail outcomes The probability of getting an outcome of headhead is 1 out of 4 outcomes or in numerical terms 14 025 or 25 However when it comes to practical application there are two major competing categories of probability interpretations whose adherents possess different views about the fundamental nature of probability Objectivists assign numbers to describe some objective or physical state of affairs The most popular version of objective probability is frequentist probability which claims that the probability of a random event denotes the relative frequency of occurrence of an experiments outcome when repeating the experiment This interpretation considers probability to be the relative frequency in the long run of outcomes 4 A modification of this is propensity probability which interprets probability as the tendency of some experiment to yield a certain outcome even if it is performed only once Subjectivists assign numbers per subjective probability ie as a degree of belief 5 The degree of belief has been interpreted as the price at which you would buy or sell a bet that pays 1 unit of utility if E 0 if not E 6 The most popular version of subjective probability is Bayesian probability which includes expert knowledge as well as experimental data to produce probabilities The expert knowledge is represented by some subjective prior probability distribution These data are incorporated in a likelihood function The product of the prior and the likelihood normalized results in a posterior probability distribution that incorporates all the information known to date 7 By Aumanns agreement theorem Bayesian agents whose prior beliefs are similar will end up with similar posterior beliefs However sufficiently different priors can lead to different conclusions regardless of how much information the agents share 8 Etymology edit See also History of probability Etymology and Glossary of probability and statistics Further information Likelihood The word probability derives from the Latin probabilitas which can also mean probity a measure of the authority of a witness in a legal case in Europe and often correlated with the witnesss nobility In a sense this differs much from the modern meaning of probability which in contrast is a measure of the weight of empirical evidence and is arrived at from inductive reasoning and statistical inference 9 History edit Main article History of probability The scientific study of probability is a modern development of mathematics Gambling shows that there has been an interest in quantifying the ideas of probability for millennia but exact mathematical descriptions arose much later There are reasons for the slow development of the mathematics of probability Whereas games of chance provided the impetus for the mathematical study of probability fundamental issues clarification needed are still obscured by the superstitions of gamblers 10 According to Richard Jeffrey Before the middle of the seventeenth century the term probable Latin probabilis meant approvable and was applied in that sense unequivocally to opinion and to action A probable action or opinion was one such as sensible people would undertake or hold in the circumstances 11 However in legal contexts especially probable could also apply to propositions for which there was good evidence 12 AlKindi s Book of Cryptographic Messages contains the earliest known use of statistical inference 9th century The earliest known forms of probability and statistics were developed by Middle Eastern mathematicians studying cryptography between the 8th and 13th centuries AlKhalil 717786 wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels AlKindi 801873 made the earliest known use of statistical inference in his work on cryptanalysis and frequency analysis An important contribution of Ibn Adlan 11871268 was on sample size for use of frequency analysis 13 Gerolamo Cardano 16th century Christiaan Huygens published one of the first books on probability 17th century The sixteenth century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes 14 Aside from the elementary work by Cardano the doctrine of probabilities dates to the correspondence of Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal 1654 Christiaan Huygens 1657 gave the earliest known scientific treatment of the subject 15 Jakob Bernoulli s Ars Conjectandi posthumous 1713 and Abraham de Moivre s Doctrine of Chances 1718 treated the subject as a branch of mathematics 16 See Ian Hacking s The Emergence of Probability 9 and James Franklins The Science of Conjecture 17 for histories of the early development of the very concept of mathematical probability The theory of errors may be traced back to Roger Cotes s Opera Miscellanea posthumous 1722 but a memoir prepared by Thomas Simpson in 1755 printed 1756 first applied the theory to the discussion of errors of observation 18 The reprint 1757 of this memoir lays down the axioms that positive and negative errors are equally probable and that certain assignable limits define the range of all errors Simpson also discusses continuous errors and describes a probability curve The first two laws of error that were proposed both originated with PierreSimon Laplace The first law was published in 1774 and stated that the frequency of an error could be expressed as an exponential function of the numerical magnitude of the error disregarding sign The second law of error was proposed in 1778 by Laplace and stated that the frequency of the error is an exponential function of the square of the error 19 The second law of error is called the normal distribution or the Gauss law It is difficult historically to attribute that law to Gauss who in spite of his wellknown precocity had probably not made this discovery before he was two years old 19 Daniel Bernoulli 1778 introduced the principle of the maximum product of the probabilities of a system of concurrent errors Carl Friedrich Gauss AdrienMarie Legendre 1805 developed the method of least squares and introduced it in his Nouvelles méthodes pour la détermination des orbites des comètes New Methods for Determining the Orbits of Comets 20 In ignorance of Legendres contribution an IrishAmerican writer Robert Adrain editor of The Analyst 1808 first deduced the law of facility of error ϕ x c e h 2 x 2 displaystyle phi xceh2x2 where h displaystyle h is a constant depending on precision of observation and c displaystyle c is a scale factor ensuring that the area under the curve equals 1 He gave two proofs the second being essentially the same as John Herschel s 1850 citation needed Gauss gave the first proof that seems to have been known in Europe the third after Adrains in 1809 Further proofs were given by Laplace 1810 1812 Gauss 1823 James Ivory 1825 1826 Hagen 1837 Friedrich Bessel 1838 WF Donkin 1844 1856 and Morgan Crofton 1870 Other contributors were Ellis 1844 De Morgan 1864 Glaisher 1872 and Giovanni Schiaparelli 1875 Peters s 1856 formula clarification needed for r the probable error of a single observation is well known In the nineteenth century authors on the general theory included Laplace Sylvestre Lacroix 1816 Littrow 1833 Adolphe Quetelet 1853 Richard Dedekind 1860 Helmert 1872 Hermann Laurent 1873 Liagre Didion and Karl Pearson Augustus De Morgan and George Boole improved the exposition of the theory Andrey Markov introduced 21 the notion of Markov chains 1906 which played an important role in stochastic processes theory and its applications The modern theory of probability based on the measure theory was developed by Andrey Kolmogorov 1931 22 On the geometric side see integral geometry contributors to The Educational Times were influential Miller Crofton McColl Wolstenholme Watson and Artemas Martin citation needed Further information History of statistics Theory edit Main article Probability theory Like other theories the theory of probability is a representation of its concepts in formal termsthat is in terms that can be considered separately from their meaning These formal terms are manipulated by the rules of mathematics and logic and any results are interpreted or translated back into the problem domain There have been at least two successful attempts to formalize probability namely the Kolmogorov formulation and the Cox formulation In Kolmogorovs formulation see probability space sets are interpreted as events and probability itself as a measure on a class of sets In Coxs theorem probability is taken as a primitive that is not further analyzed and the emphasis is on constructing a consistent assignment of probability values to propositions In both cases the laws of probability are the same except for technical details There are other methods for quantifying uncertainty such as the DempsterShafer theory or possibility theory but those are essentially different and not compatible with the laws of probability as usually understood Applications edit Probability theory is applied in everyday life in risk assessment and modeling The insurance industry and markets use actuarial science to determine pricing and make trading decisions Governments apply probabilistic methods in environmental regulation entitlement analysis Reliability theory of aging and longevity and financial regulation A good example of the use of probability theory in equity trading is the effect of the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices which have ripple effects in the economy as a whole An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can send that commoditys prices up or down and signals other traders of that opinion Accordingly the probabilities are neither assessed independently nor necessarily very rationally The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing on policy and on peace and conflict 23 In addition to financial assessment probability can be used to analyze trends in biology eg disease spread as well as ecology eg biological Punnett squares As with finance risk assessment can be used as a statistical tool to calculate the likelihood of undesirable events occurring and can assist with implementing protocols to avoid encountering such circumstances Probability is used to design games of chance so that casinos can make a guaranteed profit yet provide payouts to players that are frequent enough to encourage continued play 24 The discovery of rigorous methods to assess and combine probability assessments has changed society 25 citation needed Another significant application of probability theory in everyday life is reliability Many consumer products such as automobiles and consumer electronics use reliability theory in product design to reduce the probability of failure Failure probability may influence a manufacturers decisions on a products warranty 26 The cache language model and other statistical language models that are used in natural language processing are also examples of applications of probability theory Mathematical treatment edit See also Probability axioms Consider an experiment that can produce a number of results The collection of all possible results is called the sample space of the experiment The power set of the sample space is formed by considering all different collections of possible results For example rolling a die can produce six possible results One collection of possible results gives an odd number on the die Thus the subset 135 is an element of the power set of the sample space of dice rolls These collections are called events In this case 135 is the event that the die falls on some odd number If the results that actually occur fall in a given event the event is said to have occurred A probability is a way of assigning every event a value between zero and one with the requirement that the event made up of all possible results in our example the event 123456 is assigned a value of one To qualify as a probability the assignment of values must satisfy the requirement that if you look at a collection of mutually exclusive events events with no common results eg the events 16 3 and 24 are all mutually exclusive the probability that at least one of the events will occur is given by the sum of the probabilities of all the individual events 27 The probability of an event A is written as P A displaystyle PA p A displaystyle pA or Pr A displaystyle textPrA 28 This mathematical definition of probability can extend to infinite sample spaces and even uncountable sample spaces using the concept of a measure The opposite or complement of an event A is the event not A that is the event of A not occurring often denoted as A A A displaystyle overline AAcomplement neg A or A displaystyle sim A its probability is given by P not A 1 P A 29 As an example the chance of not rolling a six on a sixsided die is 1 chance of rolling a six 1 1 6 5 6 displaystyle 1tfrac 16tfrac 56 See Complementary event for a more complete treatment If two events A and B occur on a single performance of an experiment this is called the intersection or joint probability of A and B denoted as P A B displaystyle PAcap B Independent events

because of the 52 cards of a deck 13 are hearts 12 are face cards and 3 are both here the possibilities included in the 3 that are both are included in each of the 13 hearts and the 12 face cards but

random variable citation needed For example in a bag of 2 red balls and 2 blue balls 4 balls in total the probability of taking a red ball is 1 2 displaystyle 12 however when taking a second ball the probability of it being either a red ball or a blue ball depends on the ball previously taken such as if a red ball was taken the probability of picking a red ball again would be 1 3 displaystyle 13

probability in quantum mechanics edit Main article Randomness See also Quantum fluctuation Interpretations In a deterministic universe based on Newtonian concepts there would be no probability if all conditions were known Laplaces demon but there are situations in which sensitivity to initial conditions exceeds our ability to measure them ie know them In the case of a roulette wheel if the force of the hand and the period of that force are known the number on which the ball will stop would be a certainty though as a practical matter this would likely be true only of a roulette wheel that had not been exactly levelled as Thomas A Bass Newtonian Casino revealed This also assumes knowledge of inertia and friction of the wheel weight smoothness and roundness of the ball variations in hand speed during the turning and so forth A probabilistic description can thus be more useful than Newtonian mechanics for analyzing the pattern of outcomes of repeated rolls of a roulette wheel Physicists face the same situation in kinetic theory of gases where the system while deterministic in principle is so complex with the number of molecules typically the order of magnitude of the Avogadro constant 602 10 23 that only a statistical description of its properties is feasible Probability theory is required to describe quantum phenomena 32 A revolutionary discovery of early 20th century physics was the random character of all physical processes that occur at subatomic scales and are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics The objective wave function evolves deterministically but according to the Copenhagen interpretation it deals with probabilities of observing the outcome being explained by a wave function collapse when an observation is made However the loss of determinism for the sake of instrumentalism did not meet with universal approval Albert Einstein famously remarked in a letter to Max Born I am convinced that God does not play dice 33 Like Einstein Erwin Schrödinger who discovered the wave function believed quantum mechanics is a statistical approximation of an underlying deterministic reality 34 In some modern interpretations of the statistical mechanics of measurement quantum decoherence is invoked to account for the appearance of subjectively probabilistic experimental outcomes See also edit Mathematics portal Philosophy

Statistics Estimators Estimation Theory Probability density function In Law Balance of probabilities Notes edit Strictly speaking a probability of 0 indicates that an event almost never takes place whereas a probability of 1 indicates than an event almost certainly takes place This is an important distinction when the sample space is infinite For example for the continuous uniform distribution on the real interval 5 10 there are an infinite number of possible outcomes and the probability of any given outcome being observed for instance exactly 7 is 0 This means that when we make an observation it will almost surely not be exactly 7 However it does not mean that exactly 7 is impossible Ultimately some specific outcome with probability 0 will be observed and one possibility for that specific outcome is exactly 7 References edit Kendalls Advanced Theory of Statistics Volume 1 Distribution Theory Alan Stuart and Keith Ord 6th Ed 2009 mwparseroutput
