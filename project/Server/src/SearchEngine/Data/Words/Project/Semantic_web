Analysis Latent Machinelearning Applications Semantic file system Semantic Web Semantic wiki Language Linguistics v t e The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium W3C 1 The goal of Semantic Web is to make Internet data machinereadable To enable the encoding of semantics with the data technologies such as Resource Description Framework RDF 2 and Web Ontology Language OWL 3 are used These technologies are used to formally represent metadata For example ontology can describe concepts relationships between entities and categories of things These embedded semantics offer significant advantages such as reasoning over data and operating with heterogeneous data sources 4 These standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web fundamentally the RDF According to the W3C The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application enterprise and community boundaries 5 The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content and information applications and systems The term was coined by Tim BernersLee for a web of data or data web 6 that can be processed by machines 7 that is one in which much of the meaning is machinereadable While its critics have questioned its feasibility proponents argue that applications in library and information science industry biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept 8 BernersLee originally expressed his vision of the Semantic Web as follows mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 I have a dream for the Web in which computers become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web the content links and transactions between people and computers A Semantic Web which makes this possible has yet to emerge but when it does the daytoday mechanisms of trade bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines The intelligent agents people have touted for ages will finally materialize 9 The 2001 Scientific American article by BernersLee Hendler and Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web 10 In 2006 BernersLee and colleagues stated that This simple idearemains largely unrealized 11 In 2013 more than four million Web domains contained Semantic Web markup 12 Contents 1 Example 2 Background 21 Limitations of HTML 22 Semantic Web

Paul Schuster was born in Dresden on a Website will be annotated connecting a person with its place of birth The following HTML fragment shows how a small graph is being described in RDFa syntax using a schemaorg vocabulary and a Wikidata ID Graph resulting from the RDFa example div vocab httpschemaorg typeof Person span property name Paul Schuster span was born in span property birthPlace typeof Place href httpwwwwikidataorgentityQ1731 span property name Dresden span span div The example defines the following five triples shown in Turtle Syntax Each triple represents one edge in the resulting graph the first element of the triple the subject is the name of the node where the edge starts the second element the predicate the type of the edge and the last and third element the object either the name of the node where the edge ends or a literal value eg a text a number etc a httpwwww3org19990222rdfsyntaxnstype httpschemaorgPerson a httpschemaorgname Paul Schuster a httpschemaorgbirthPlace httpwwwwikidataorgentityQ1731 httpwwwwikidataorgentityQ1731 httpschemaorgitemtype httpschemaorgPlace httpwwwwikidataorgentityQ1731 httpschemaorgname Dresden The triples result in the graph shown in the given figure Graph resulting from the RDFa example enriched with further data from the Web One of the advantages of using Uniform Resource Identifiers URIs is that they can be dereferenced using the HTTP protocol According to the socalled Linked Open Data principles such a dereferenced URI should result in a document that offers further data about the given URI In this example all URIs both for edges and nodes eg httpschemaorgPerson httpschemaorgbirthPlace httpwwwwikidataorgentityQ1731 can be dereferenced and will result in further RDF graphs describing the URI eg that Dresden is a city in Germany or that a person in the sense of that URI can be fictional The second graph shows the previous example but now enriched with a few of the triples from the documents that result from dereferencing httpschemaorgPerson green edge and httpwwwwikidataorgentityQ1731 blue edges Additionally to the edges given in the involved documents explicitly edges can be automatically inferred the triple a httpwwww3org19990222rdfsyntaxnstype httpschemaorgPerson from the original RDFa fragment and the triple httpschemaorgPerson httpwwww3org200207owlequivalentClass httpxmlnscomfoaf01Person from the document at httpschemaorgPerson green edge in the Figure allow to infer the following triple given OWL semantics red dashed line in the second Figure a httpwwww3org19990222rdfsyntaxnstype httpxmlnscomfoaf01Person Background edit Further information Semantic network History The concept of the semantic network model was formed in the early 1960s by researchers such as the cognitive scientist Allan M Collins linguist M Ross Quillian and psychologist Elizabeth F Loftus as a form to represent semantically structured knowledge When applied in the context of the modern internet it extends the network of hyperlinked humanreadable web pages by inserting machinereadable metadata about pages and how they are related to each other This enables automated agents to access the Web more intelligently and perform more tasks on behalf of users The term Semantic Web was coined by Tim BernersLee 7 the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web Consortium W3C which oversees the development of proposed Semantic Web standards He defines the Semantic Web as a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines Many of the technologies proposed by the W3C already existed before they were positioned under the W3C umbrella These are used in various contexts particularly those dealing with information that encompasses a limited and defined domain and where sharing data is a common necessity such as scientific research or data exchange among businesses In addition other technologies with similar goals have emerged such as microformats Limitations of HTML edit Many files on a typical computer can also be loosely divided into humanreadable documents and machinereadable data Documents like mail messages reports and brochures are read by humans Data such as calendars addressbooks playlists and spreadsheets are presented using an application program that lets them be viewed searched and combined Currently the World Wide Web is based mainly on documents written in Hypertext Markup Language HTML a markup convention that is used for coding a body of text interspersed with multimedia objects such as images and interactive forms Metadata tags provide a method by which computers can categorize the content of web pages In the examples below the field names keywords description and author are assigned values such as computing and cheap widgets for sale and John Doe meta name keywords content computing computer studies computer meta name description content Cheap widgets for sale meta name author content John Doe Because of this metadata tagging and categorization other computer systems that want to access and share this data can easily identify the relevant values With HTML and a tool to render it perhaps web browser software perhaps another user agent one can create and present a page that lists items for sale The HTML of this catalog page can make simple documentlevel assertions such as this documents title is Widget Superstore but there is no capability within the HTML itself to assert unambiguously that for example item number X586172 is an Acme Gizmo with a retail price of 199 or that it is a consumer product Rather HTML can only say that the span of text X586172 is something that should be positioned near Acme Gizmo and 199 etc There is no way to say this is a catalog or even to establish that Acme Gizmo is a kind of title or that 199 is a price There is also no way to express that these pieces of information are bound together in describing a discrete item distinct from other items perhaps listed on the page Semantic HTML refers to the traditional HTML practice of markup following intention rather than specifying layout details directly For example the use of em denoting emphasis rather than i which specifies italics Layout details are left up to the browser in combination with Cascading Style Sheets But this practice falls short of specifying the semantics of objects such as items for sale or prices Microformats extend HTML syntax to create machinereadable semantic markup about objects including people organisations events and products 13 Similar initiatives include RDFa Microdata and Schemaorg Semantic Web solutions edit The Semantic Web takes the solution further It involves publishing in languages specifically designed for data Resource Description Framework RDF Web Ontology Language OWL and Extensible Markup Language XML HTML describes documents and the links between them RDF OWL and XML by contrast can describe arbitrary things such as people meetings or airplane parts These technologies are combined in order to provide descriptions that supplement or replace the content of Web documents Thus content may manifest itself as descriptive data stored in Webaccessible databases 14 or as markup within documents particularly in Extensible HTML XHTML interspersed with XML or more often purely in XML with layout or rendering cues stored separately The machinereadable descriptions enable content managers to add meaning to the content ie to describe the structure of the knowledge we have about that content In this way a machine can process knowledge itself instead of text using processes similar to human deductive reasoning and inference thereby obtaining more meaningful results and helping computers to perform automated information gathering and research An example of a tag that would be used in a nonsemantic web page item blog item Encoding similar information in a semantic web page might look like this item rdfabout httpexampleorgsemanticweb Semantic Web item Tim BernersLee calls the resulting network of Linked Data the Giant Global Graph in contrast to the HTMLbased World Wide Web BernersLee posits that if the past was document sharing the future is data sharing His answer to the question of how provides three points of instruction One a URL should point to the data Two anyone accessing the URL should get data back Three relationships in the data should point to additional URLs with data Web 30 edit Tim BernersLee has described the semantic web as a component of Web 30 15 People keep asking what Web 30 is I think maybe when youve got an overlay of scalable vector graphics everything rippling and folding and looking misty on Web 20 and access to a semantic Web integrated across a huge space of data youll have access to an unbelievable data resource Tim BernersLee 2006 Semantic Web is sometimes used as a synonym for Web 30 16 though the definition of each term varies Web 30 has started to emerge as a movement away from the centralisation of services like search social media and chat applications that are dependent on a single organisation to function 17 Guardian journalist John Harris reviewed the Web 30 concept favorably in early2019 and in particular work by BernersLee on a project called Solid based around personal data stores or Pods over which individuals retain control 18 BernersLee has formed a startup Inrupt to advance the idea and attract volunteer developers 19 20 Challenges edit Some of the challenges for the Semantic Web include vastness vagueness uncertainty inconsistency and deceit Automated reasoning systems will have to deal with all of these issues in order to deliver on the promise of the Semantic Web Vastness The World Wide Web contains many billions of pages The SNOMED CT medical terminology ontology alone contains 370000 class names and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms Any automated reasoning system will have to deal with truly huge inputs Vagueness These are imprecise concepts like young or tall This arises from the vagueness of user queries of concepts represented by content providers of matching query terms to provider terms and of trying to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts Fuzzy logic is the most common technique for dealing with vagueness Uncertainty These are precise concepts with uncertain values For example a patient might present a set of symptoms that correspond to a number of different distinct diagnoses each with a different probability Probabilistic reasoning techniques are generally employed to address uncertainty Inconsistency These are logical contradictions that will inevitably arise during the development of large ontologies and when ontologies from separate sources are combined Deductive reasoning fails catastrophically when faced with inconsistency because anything follows from a contradiction Defeasible reasoning and paraconsistent reasoning are two techniques that can be employed to deal with inconsistency Deceit This is when the producer of the information is intentionally misleading the consumer of the information Cryptography techniques are currently utilized to alleviate this threat By providing a means to determine the informations integrity including that which relates to the identity of the entity that produced or published the information however credibility issues still have to be addressed in cases of potential deceit This list of challenges is illustrative rather than exhaustive and it focuses on the challenges to the unifying logic and proof layers of the Semantic Web The World Wide Web Consortium W3C Incubator Group for Uncertainty Reasoning for the World Wide Web URW3XG final report lumps these problems together under the single heading of uncertainty 21 Many of the techniques mentioned here will require extensions to the Web Ontology Language OWL for example to annotate conditional probabilities This is an area of active research 22 Standards edit Standardization for Semantic Web in the context of Web 30 is under the care of W3C 23 Components edit The term Semantic Web is often used more specifically to refer to the formats and technologies that enable it 5 The collection structuring and recovery of linked data are enabled by technologies that provide a formal description of concepts terms and relationships within a given knowledge domain These technologies are specified as W3C standards and include Resource Description Framework RDF a general method for describing information RDF Schema RDFS Simple Knowledge Organization System SKOS SPARQL an RDF query language Notation3 N3 designed with humanreadability in mind NTriples a format for storing and transmitting data Turtle Terse RDF Triple Language Web Ontology Language OWL a family of knowledge representation languages Rule Interchange Format RIF a framework of web rule language dialects supporting rule interchange on the Web The Semantic Web Stack The Semantic Web Stack illustrates the architecture of the Semantic Web The functions and relationships of the components can be summarized as follows 24 XML provides an elemental syntax for content structure within documents yet associates no semantics with the meaning of the content contained within XML is not at present a necessary component of Semantic Web technologies in most cases as alternative syntaxes exists such as Turtle Turtle is a de facto standard but has not been through a formal standardization process XML Schema is a language for providing and restricting the structure and content of elements contained within XML documents RDF is a simple language for expressing data models which refer to objects web resources and their relationships An RDFbased model can be represented in a variety of syntaxes eg RDFXML N3 Turtle and RDFa RDF is a fundamental standard of the Semantic Web 25 26 RDF Schema extends RDF and is a vocabulary for describing properties and classes of RDFbased resources with semantics for generalizedhierarchies of such properties and classes OWL adds more vocabulary for describing properties and classes among others relations between classes eg disjointness cardinality eg exactly one equality richer typing of properties characteristics of properties eg symmetry and enumerated classes SPARQL is a protocol and query language for semantic web data sources RIF is the W3C Rule Interchange Format Its an XML language for expressing Web rules that computers can execute RIF provides multiple versions called dialects It includes a RIF Basic Logic Dialect RIFBLD and RIF Production Rules Dialect RIF PRD Current state of standardization edit Wellestablished standards RDF RDFS Rule Interchange Format RIF SPARQL Unicode Uniform Resource Identifier Web Ontology Language OWL XML Not yet fully realized Unifying Logic and Proof layers Semantic Web Rule Language SWRL Applications edit The intent is to enhance the usability and usefulness of the Web and its interconnected resources by creating Semantic Web Services such as Servers that expose existing data systems using the RDF and SPARQL standards Many converters to RDF exist from different applications 27 Relational databases are an important source The semantic web server attaches to the existing system without affecting its operation Documents marked up with semantic information an extension of the HTML meta tags used in todays Web pages to supply information for Web search engines using web crawlers This could be machineunderstandable information about the humanunderstandable content of the document such as the creator title description etc or it could be purely metadata representing a set of facts such as resources and services elsewhere on the site Note that anything that can be identified with a Uniform Resource Identifier URI can be described so the semantic web can reason about animals people places ideas etc There are four semantic annotation formats that can be used in HTML documents Microformat RDFa Microdata and JSONLD 28 Semantic markup is often generated automatically rather than manually Common metadata vocabularies ontologies and maps between vocabularies that allow document creators to know how to mark up their documents so that agents can use the information in the supplied metadata so that Author in the sense of the Author of the page wont be confused with Author in the sense of a book that is the subject of a book review Automated agents to perform tasks for users of the semantic web using this data Webbased services often with agents of their own to supply information specifically to agents for example a Trust service that an agent could ask if some online store has a history of poor service or spamming Such services could be useful to public search engines or could be used for knowledge management within an organization Business applications include Facilitating the integration of information from mixed sources Dissolving ambiguities in corporate terminology Improving information retrieval thereby reducing information overload and increasing the refinement and precision of the data retrieved 29 30 31 32 Identifying relevant information with respect to a given domain 33 Providing decision making support In a corporation there is a closed group of users and the management is able to enforce company guidelines like the adoption of specific ontologies and use of semantic annotation Compared to the public Semantic Web there are lesser requirements on scalability and the information circulating within a company can be more trusted in general privacy is less of an issue outside of handling of customer data Skeptical reactions edit Practical feasibility edit Critics question the basic feasibility of a complete or even partial fulfillment of the Semantic Web pointing out both difficulties in setting it up and a lack of generalpurpose usefulness that prevents the required effort from being invested In a 2003 paper Marshall and Shipman point out the cognitive overhead inherent in formalizing knowledge compared to the authoring of traditional web hypertext 34 While learning the basics of HTML is relatively straightforward learning a knowledge representation language or tool requires the author to learn about the representations methods of abstraction and their effect on reasoning For example understanding the classinstance relationship or the superclasssubclass relationship is more than understanding that one concept is a type of another concept These abstractions are taught to computer scientists generally and knowledge engineers specifically but do not match the similar natural language meaning of being a type of something Effective use of such a formal representation requires the author to become a skilled knowledge engineer in addition to any other skills required by the domain Once one has learned a formal representation language it is still often much more effort to express ideas in that representation than in a less formal representation Indeed this is a form of programming based on the declaration of semantic data and requires an understanding of how reasoning algorithms will interpret the authored structures According to Marshall and Shipman the tacit and changing nature of much knowledge adds to the knowledge engineering problem and limits the Semantic Webs applicability to specific domains A further issue that they point out are domain or organisationspecific ways to express knowledge which must be solved through community agreement rather than only technical means 34 As it turns out specialized communities and organizations for intracompany projects have tended to adopt semantic web technologies greater than peripheral and lessspecialized communities 35 The practical constraints toward adoption have appeared less challenging where domain and scope is more limited than that of the general public and the WorldWide Web 35 Finally Marshall and Shipman see pragmatic problems in the idea of Knowledge Navigator style intelligent agents working in the largely manually curated Semantic Web 34 In situations in which user needs are known and distributed information resources are well described this approach can be highly effective in situations that are not foreseen and that bring together an unanticipated array of information resources the Google approach is more robust Furthermore the Semantic Web relies on inference chains that are more brittle a missing element of the chain results in a failure to perform the desired action while the human can supply missing pieces in a more Googlelike approach costbenefit tradeoffs can work in favor of speciallycreated Semantic Web metadata directed at weaving together sensible wellstructured domainspecific information resources close attention to usercustomer needs will drive these federations if they are to be successful Cory Doctorow s critique metacrap is from the perspective of human behavior and personal preferences For example people may include spurious metadata into Web pages in an attempt to mislead Semantic Web engines that naively assume the metadatas veracity This phenomenon was wellknown with metatags that fooled the Altavista ranking algorithm into elevating the ranking of certain Web pages the Google indexing engine specifically looks for such attempts at manipulation Peter Gärdenfors and Timo Honkela point out that logicbased semantic web technologies cover only a fraction of the relevant phenomena related to semantics 36 37 Censorship and privacy edit Enthusiasm about the semantic web could be tempered by concerns regarding censorship and privacy For instance textanalyzing techniques can now be easily bypassed by using other words metaphors for instance or by using images in place of words An advanced implementation of the semantic web would make it much easier for governments to control the viewing and creation of online information as this information would be much easier for an automated contentblocking machine to understand In addition the issue has also been raised that with the use of FOAF files and geolocation metadata there would be very little anonymity associated with the authorship of articles on things such as a personal blog Some of these concerns were addressed in the Policy Aware Web project 38 and is an active research and development topic Doubling output formats edit Another criticism of the semantic web is that it would be much more timeconsuming to create and publish content because there would need to be two formats for one piece of data one for human viewing and one for machines However many web applications in development are addressing this issue by creating a machinereadable format upon the publishing of data or the request of a machine for such data The development of microformats has been one reaction to this kind of criticism Another argument in defense of the feasibility of semantic web is the likely falling price of human intelligence tasks in digital labor markets such as Amazon s Mechanical Turk citation needed Specifications such as eRDF and RDFa allow arbitrary RDF data to be embedded in HTML pages The GRDDL Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Language mechanism allows existing material including microformats to be automatically interpreted as RDF so publishers only need to use a single format such as HTML Research activities on corporate applications edit The first research group explicitly focusing on the Corporate Semantic Web was the ACACIA team at INRIASophiaAntipolis founded in 2002 Results of their work include the RDFS based Corese search engine and the application of semantic web technology in the realm of Elearning 39 Since 2008 the Corporate Semantic Web research group located at the Free University of Berlin focuses on building blocks Corporate Semantic Search Corporate Semantic Collaboration and Corporate Ontology Engineering 40 Ontology engineering research includes the question of how to involve nonexpert users in creating ontologies and semantically annotated content 41 and for extracting explicit knowledge from the interaction of users within enterprises Future of applications edit Tim OReilly who coined the term Web 20 proposed a longterm vision of the Semantic Web as a web of data where sophisticated applications manipulate the data web 42 The data web transforms the Web from a distributed file system into a distributed database system 43 See also edit AGRIS Business semantics management
