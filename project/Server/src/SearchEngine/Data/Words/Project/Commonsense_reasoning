Commonsense reasoning Branch of artificial intelligence aiming to create AI systems with common sense Commonsense reasoning is one of the branches of artificial intelligence AI that is concerned with simulating the human ability to make presumptions about the type and essence of ordinary situations they encounter every day 1 These assumptions include judgments about the physical properties purpose intentions and behavior of people and objects as well as possible outcomes of their actions and interactions A device that exhibits commonsense reasoning will be capable of predicting results and drawing conclusions that are similar to humans folk psychology humans innate ability to reason about peoples behavior and intentions and naive physics humans natural understanding of the physical

Commonsense knowledge edit In Artificial intelligence commonsense knowledge is the set of background information that an individual is intended to know or assume and the ability to use it when appropriate It is a shared knowledge between everybody or people in a particular culture or age group only The way to obtain commonsense is by learning it or experiencing it In communication it is what people dont have to say because the interlocutor is expected to know or make a presumption about Commonsense knowledge problem edit The commonsense knowledge problem is a current project in the sphere of artificial intelligence to create a database that contains the general knowledge most individuals are expected to have represented in an accessible way to artificial intelligence programs 2 that use natural language Due to the broad scope of the commonsense knowledge this issue is considered to be among the most difficult ones in the AI research 3 sphere In order for any task to be done as a human mind would manage it the machine is required to appear as intelligent as a human being Such tasks include object recognition machine translation and text mining To perform them the machine has to be aware of the same concepts that an individual who possess commonsense knowledge recognizes Commonsense in intelligent tasks edit In 1961 Bar Hillel first discussed the need and significance of practical knowledge for natural language processing in the context of machine translation 4 Some ambiguities are resolved by using simple and easy to acquire rules Others require a broad acknowledgement of the surrounding world thus they require more commonsense knowledge For instance when a machine is used to translate a text problems of ambiguity arise which could be easily resolved by attaining a concrete and true understanding of the context Online translators often resolve ambiguities using analogous or similar words For example in translating the sentences The electrician is working and The telephone is working into German the machine translates correctly working in the means of laboring in the first one and as functioning properly in the second one The machine has seen and read in the body of texts that the German words for laboring and electrician are frequently used in a combination and are found close together The same applies for telephone and function properly However the statistical proxy which works in simple cases often fails in complex ones Existing computer programs carry out simple language tasks by manipulating short phrases or separate words but they dont attempt any deeper understanding and focus on shortterm results Computer vision edit Issues of this kind arise in computer vision 5 6 For instance when looking at the photograph of the bathroom some of the items that are small and only partly seen such as the towels or the body lotions are recognizable due to the surrounding objects toilet wash basin bathtub which suggest the purpose of the room In an isolated image they would be difficult to identify Movies prove to be even more difficult tasks Some movies contain scenes and moments that cannot be understood by simply matching memorized templates to images For instance to understand the context of the movie the viewer is required to make inferences about characters intentions and make presumptions depending on their behavior In the contemporary state of the art it is impossible to build and manage a program that will perform such tasks as reasoning ie predicting characters actions The most that can be done is to identify basic actions and track characters Robotic manipulation edit The need and importance of commonsense reasoning in autonomous robots that work in a reallife uncontrolled environment is evident For instance if a robot is programmed to perform the tasks of a waiter on a cocktail party and it sees that the glass he had picked up is broken the waiterrobot should not pour liquid into the glass but instead pick up another one Such tasks seem obvious when an individual possess simple commonsense reasoning but to ensure that a robot will avoid such mistakes is challenging Successes in automated commonsense reasoning edit Significant progress in the field of the automated commonsense reasoning is made in the areas of the taxonomic reasoning actions and change reasoning reasoning about time Each of these spheres has a wellacknowledged theory for wide range of commonsense inferences 7 Taxonomic reasoning edit Taxonomy is the collection of individuals and categories and their relations Taxonomies are often referred to as semantic networks Figure 2 displays a taxonomy of a few categories of individuals and animalsThree basic relations are demonstrated An individual is an instance of a category For example the individual Tweety is an instance of the category robin One category is a subset of another For instance robin is a subset of bird Two categories are disjoint For instance robin is disjoint from penguin Transitivity is one type of inference in taxonomy Since Tweety is an instance of robin and robin is a subset of bird it follows that Tweety is an instance of bird Inheritance is another type of inference Since Tweety is an instance of robin which is a subset of bird and bird is marked with property canfly it follows that Tweety and robin have property canfly When an individual taxonomizes more abstract categories outlining and delimiting specific categories becomes more problematic Simple taxonomic structures are frequently used in AI programs For instance WordNet is a resource including a taxonomy whose elements are meanings of English words Web mining systems used to collect commonsense knowledge from Web documents focus on taxonomic relations and specifically in gathering taxonomic relations 8 Action and change edit The theory of action events and change is another range of the commonsense reasoning 9 There are established reasoning methods for domains that satisfy the constraints listed below Events are atomic meaning one event occurs at a time and the reasoner needs to consider the state and condition of the world at the start and at the finale of the specific event but not during the states while there is still an evidence of ongoing changes progress Every single change is a result of some event Events are deterministic meaning the worlds state at the end of the event is defined by the worlds state at the beginning and the specification of the event There is a single actor and all events are his actions The relevant state of the world at the beginning is either known or can be calculated Temporal reasoning edit Temporal reasoning is the ability to make presumptions about humans knowledge of times durations and time intervals For example if an individual knows that Mozart was born after Hadyn and died earlier than him they can use their temporal reasoning knowledge to deduce that Mozart had died younger than Hadyn The inferences involved reduce themselves to solving systems of linear inequalities 10 To integrate that kind of reasoning with concrete purposes such as natural language interpretation is more challenging because natural language expressions have context dependent interpretation 11 Simple tasks such as assigning timestamps to procedures cannot be done with total accuracy Qualitative reasoning edit Qualitative reasoning 12 is the form of commonsense reasoning analyzed with certain success It is concerned with the direction of change in interrelated quantities For instance if the price of a stock goes up the amount of stocks that are going to be sold will go down If some ecosystem contains wolves and lambs and the number of wolves decreases the death rate of the lambs will go down as well This theory was firstly formulated by Johan de Kleer who analyzed an object moving on a roller coaster The theory of qualitative reasoning is applied in many spheres such as physics biology engineering ecology etc It serves as the basis for many practical programs analogical mapping text understanding Challenges in automating commonsense reasoning edit As of 2014 there are some commercial systems trying to make the use of commonsense reasoning significant However they use statistical information as a proxy for commonsense knowledge where reasoning is absent Current programs manipulate individual words but they dont attempt or offer further understanding Five major obstacles interfere with the producing of a satisfactory commonsense reasoner 13 First some of the domains that are involved in commonsense reasoning are only partly understood Individuals are far from a comprehensive understanding of domains as communication and knowledge interpersonal interactions or physical processes Second situations that seem easily predicted or assumed about could have logical complexity which humans commonsense knowledge does not cover Some aspects of similar situations are studied and are well understood but there are many relations that are unknown even in principle and how they could be represented in a form that is usable by computers Third commonsense reasoning involves plausible reasoning It requires coming to a reasonable conclusion given what is already known Plausible reasoning has been studied for many years and there are a lot of theories developed that include probabilistic reasoning and nonmonotonic logic It takes different forms that include using unreliable data and rules whose conclusions are not certain sometimes Fourth there are many domains in which a small number of examples are extremely frequent whereas there is a vast number of highly infrequent examples Fifth when formulating presumptions it is challenging to discern and determine the level of abstraction 14 Compared with humans all existing computer programs perform extremely poorly on modern commonsense reasoning benchmark tests such as the Winograd Schema Challenge 15 The problem of attaining humanlevel competency at commonsense knowledge tasks is considered to probably be AI complete that is solving it would require the ability to synthesize a humanlevel intelligence 16 17 Approaches and techniques edit Commonsenses reasoning study is divided into knowledgebased approaches and approaches that are based on machine learning over and using a large data corpora with limited interactions between these two types of approaches There are also crowdsourcing approaches attempting to construct a knowledge basis by linking the collective knowledge and the input of nonexpert people Knowledgebased approaches can be separated into approaches based on mathematical logic In knowledgebased approaches the experts are analyzing the characteristics of the inferences that are required to do reasoning in a specific area or for a certain task The knowledgebased approaches consist of mathematically grounded approaches informal knowledgebased approaches and largescale approaches The mathematically grounded approaches are purely theoretical and the result is a printed paper instead of a program The work is limited to the range of the domains and the reasoning techniques that are being reflected on In informal knowledgebased approaches theories of reasoning are based on anecdotal data and intuition that are results from empirical behavioral psychology Informal approaches are common in computer programming Two other popular techniques for extracting commonsense knowledge from Web documents involve Web mining and Crowd sourcing References
