parts of the Brain René Descartes illustration of mindbody dualism Descartes believed inputs are passed on by the Sensory organs to the epiphysis in the brain and from there to the immaterial spirit 2 The mind is the set of cognitive faculties including consciousness imagination perception thinking judgement language and memory which is housed in the brain sometimes including the central nervous system It is usually defined as the faculty of an entitys thoughts and consciousness 3 It holds the power of imagination recognition and appreciation and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions resulting in attitudes and actions citation needed There is a lengthy tradition in philosophy religion psychology and cognitive science about what constitutes a mind and what are its distinguishing properties One open question regarding the nature of the mind is the mindbody problem which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical brain and nervous system 4 Older viewpoints included dualism and idealism which considered the mind somehow nonphysical 4 Modern views often center around physicalism and functionalism which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity 5 need quotation to verify though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10 citation needed For example whether mind is exclusive to humans possessed also by some or all animals by all living things whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all or whether mind can also be a property of some types of humanmade machines citation needed Whatever its nature it is generally agreed that mind is that which enables a being to have subjective awareness and intentionality towards their environment to perceive and respond to stimuli with some kind of agency and to have consciousness including thinking and feeling citation needed The concept of mind is understood in many different ways by many different cultural and religious traditions Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to nonliving entities eg panpsychism and animism to animals and to deities Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind sometimes described as identical with soul or spirit to theories concerning both life after death and cosmological and natural order for example in the doctrines of Zoroaster the Buddha Plato Aristotle and other ancient Greek Indian and later Islamic and medieval European philosophers Important philosophers of mind include Plato Patanjali Descartes Leibniz Locke Berkeley Hume Kant Hegel Schopenhauer Searle Dennett Fodor Nagel and Chalmers 6 Psychologists such as Freud and James and computer scientists such as Turing and Putnam developed influential theories about the nature of the mind The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of artificial intelligence which works closely in relation with cybernetics and information theory to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind 7 The mind is also portrayed as the stream of consciousness where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing 8 9 Contents 1 Etymology 2 Definitions 3 Mental faculties 4 Mental content 41 Memetics 5 Relation to the brain 6 Evolutionary history of the human mind 7 Philosophy of mind 71

the faculty of memory not of thought in general citation needed Hence call to mind come to mind keep in mind to have mind of etc The word retains this sense in Scotland 10 Old English had other words to express mind such as hyge mind spirit 11 The meaning of memory is shared with Old Norse which has munr The word is originally from a PIE verbal root men meaning to think remember whence also Latin mens mind Sanskrit manas mind and Greek μένος mind courage anger The generalization of mind to include all mental faculties thought volition feeling and memory gradually develops over the 14th and 15th centuries 12 Definitions edit The attributes that make up the mind are debated Some psychologists argue that only the higher intellectual functions constitute mind particularly reason and memory 13 In this view the emotions love hate fear and joy are more primitive or subjective in nature and should be seen as different from the mind as such Others argue that various rational and emotional states cannot be so separated that they are of the same nature and origin and should therefore be considered all part of it as mind citation needed In popular usage mind is frequently synonymous with thought the private conversation with ourselves that we carry on inside our heads 14 Thus we make up our minds change our minds or are of two minds about something One of the key attributes of the mind in this sense is that it is a private sphere to which no one but the owner has access No one else can know our mind They can only interpret what we consciously or unconsciously communicate 15 Mental faculties edit See also Nous Reason Modularity of mind and Mental process Broadly speaking mental faculties are the various functions of the mind or things the mind can do Thought is a mental act that allows humans to make sense of things in the world and to represent and interpret them in ways that are significant or which accord with their needs attachments goals commitments plans ends desires etc Thinking involves the symbolic or semiotic mediation of ideas or data as when we form concepts engage in problem solving reasoning and making decisions Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include deliberation cognition ideation discourse and imagination Thinking is sometimes described as a higher cognitive function and the analysis of thinking processes is a part of cognitive psychology It is also deeply connected with our capacity to make and use tools to understand cause and effect to recognize patterns of significance to comprehend and disclose unique contexts of experience or activity and to respond to the world in a meaningful way Memory is the ability to preserve retain and subsequently recall knowledge information or experience Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in philosophy the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of cognitive psychology In recent decades it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called cognitive neuroscience a marriage between cognitive psychology and neuroscience Imagination is the activity of generating or evoking novel situations images ideas or other qualia in the mind It is a characteristically subjective activity rather than a direct or passive experience The term is technically used in psychology for the process of reviving in the mind percepts of objects formerly given in sense perception Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary language some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as imaging or imagery or to speak of it as reproductive as opposed to productive or constructive imagination Things imagined are said to be seen in the minds eye Among the many practical functions of imagination are the ability to project possible futures or histories to see things from anothers perspective and to change the way something is perceived including to make decisions to respond to or enact what is imagined Consciousness in mammals this includes humans is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as subjectivity sentience and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and ones environment It is a subject of much research in philosophy of mind psychology neuroscience and cognitive science Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness which is subjective experience itself and access consciousness which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain 16 Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities often referred to as qualia Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness of something or about something a property known as intentionality in philosophy of mind Mental content edit Mental contents are those items that are thought of as being in the mind and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and faculties Examples include thoughts concepts memories emotions percepts and intentions Philosophical theories of mental content include internalism externalism representationalism and intentionality 17 Memetics edit Memetics is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with Darwinian evolution which was originated by Richard Dawkins and Douglas Hofstadter in the 1980s It is an evolutionary model of cultural information transfer A meme analogous to a gene is an idea belief pattern of behaviour etc hosted in one or more individual minds and can reproduce itself from mind to mind Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief is seen memetically as a meme reproducing itself Relation to the brain edit See also Cognitive neuroscience In animals the brain or encephalon Greek for in the head is the control center of the central nervous system responsible for thought In most animals the brain is located in the head protected by the skull and close to the primary sensory apparatus of vision hearing equilibrioception taste and olfaction While all vertebrates have a brain most invertebrates have either a centralized brain or collections of individual ganglia Primitive animals such as sponges do not have a brain at all Brains can be extremely complex For example the human brain contains around 86 billion neurons each linked to as many as 10000 others 18 19 Understanding the relationship between the brain and the mind mindbody problem is one of the central issues in the history of philosophy is a challenging problem both philosophically and scientifically 20 There are three major philosophical schools of thought concerning the answer dualism materialism and idealism Dualism holds that the mind exists independently of the brain 21 materialism holds that mental phenomena are identical to neuronal phenomena 22 and idealism holds that only mental phenomena exist 22 Through most of history many philosophers found it inconceivable that cognition could be implemented by a physical substance such as brain tissue that is neurons and synapses 23 Descartes who thought extensively about mindbrain relationships found it possible to explain reflexes and other simple behaviors in mechanistic terms although he did not believe that complex thought and language in particular could be explained by reference to the physical brain alone 24 The most straightforward scientific evidence of a strong relationship between the physical brain matter and the mind is the impact physical alterations to the brain have on the mind such as with traumatic brain injury and psychoactive drug use 25 Philosopher Patricia Churchland notes that this drugmind interaction indicates an intimate connection between the brain and the mind 26 In addition to the philosophical questions the relationship between mind and brain involves a number of scientific questions including understanding the relationship between mental activity and brain activity the exact mechanisms by which drugs influence cognition and the neural correlates of consciousness Theoretical approaches to explain how mind emerges from the brain include connectionism computationalism and Bayesian brain Evolutionary history of the human mind edit The evolution of human intelligence refers to several theories that aim to describe how human intelligence has evolved in relation to the evolution of the human brain and the origin of language 27 The timeline of human evolution spans some 7 million years from the separation of the genus Pan until the emergence of behavioral modernity by 50000 years ago Of this timeline the first 3 million years concern Sahelanthropus the following 2 million concern Australopithecus while the final 2 million span the history of actual Homo species the Paleolithic Many traits of human intelligence such as empathy theory of mind mourning ritual and the use of symbols and tools are already apparent in great apes although in lesser sophistication than in humans There is a debate between supporters of the idea of a sudden emergence of intelligence or Great leap forward and those of a gradual or continuum hypothesis Theories of the evolution of intelligence include Robin Dunbar s social brain hypothesis 28 Geoffrey Miller s sexual selection hypothesis concerning Sexual selection in human evolution 29 The ecological dominancesocial competition EDSC 30 explained by Mark V Flinn David C Geary and Carol V Ward based mainly on work by Richard D Alexander The idea of intelligence as a signal of good health and resistance to disease The Group selection theory contends that organism characteristics that provide benefits to a group clan tribe or larger population can evolve despite individual disadvantages such as those cited above The idea that intelligence is connected with nutrition and thereby with status 31 A higher IQ could be a signal that an individual comes from and lives in a physical and social environment where nutrition levels are high and vice versa Philosophy of mind edit Main article Philosophy of mind Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind mental events mental functions mental properties consciousness and their relationship to the physical body The mindbody problem ie the relationship of the mind to the body is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body 32 José Manuel Rodriguez Delgado writes In present popular usage soul and mind are not clearly differentiated and some people more or less consciously still feel that the soul and perhaps the mind may enter or leave the body as independent entities 33 Dualism and monism are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mindbody problem Dualism is the position that mind and body are in some way separate from each other It can be traced back to Plato 34 Aristotle 35 36 37 and the Nyaya Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy 38 but it was most precisely formulated by René Descartes in the 17th century 39 Substance dualists argue that the mind is an independently existing substance whereas Property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain but that it is not a distinct substance 40 The 20th century philosopher Martin Heidegger suggested that subjective experience and activity ie the mind cannot be made sense of in terms of Cartesian substances that bear properties at all whether the mind itself is thought of as a distinct separate kind of substance or not This is because the nature of subjective qualitative experience is incoherent in terms of or semantically incommensurable with the concept of substances that bear properties This is a fundamentally ontological argument 41 The philosopher of cognitive science Daniel Dennett for example argues there is no such thing as a narrative center called the mind but that instead there is simply a collection of sensory inputs and outputs different kinds of software running in parallel 42 Psychologist BF Skinner argued that the mind is an explanatory fiction that diverts attention from environmental causes of behavior 43 he considered the mind a black box and thought that mental processes may be better conceived of as forms of covert verbal behavior 44 45 Philosopher David Chalmers has argued that the third person approach to uncovering mind and consciousness is not effective such as looking into others brains or observing human conduct but that a first person approach is necessary Such a first person perspective indicates that the mind must be conceptualized as something distinct from the brain The mind has also been described as manifesting from moment to moment one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing 9 8 Mindbody perspectives edit Monism is the position that mind and body are not physiologically and ontologically distinct kinds of entities This view was first advocated in Western Philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th Century BC and was later espoused by the 17th Century rationalist Baruch Spinoza 46 According to Spinozas dualaspect theory mind and body are two aspects of an underlying reality which he variously described as Nature or God Physicalists argue that only the entities postulated by physical theory exist and that the mind will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself or an illusion created by the mind Neutral monists adhere to the position that perceived things in the world can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver For example a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system Unlike dualaspect theory neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism these positions include behaviorism the type identity theory anomalous monism and functionalism 47 Many modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive or nonreductive physicalist position maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body 47 These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences eg in the fields of sociobiology computer science evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences 48 49 50 51 Other philosophers however adopt a nonphysicalist position which challenges the notion that the mind is a purely physical construct Reductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states 52 53 54 Nonreductive physicalists argue that although the brain is all there is to the mind the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable and cannot be reduced to the language and lowerlevel explanations of physical science 55 56 Continued progress in neuroscience has helped to clarify many of these issues and its findings have been taken by many to support physicalists assertions 57 58 Nevertheless our knowledge is incomplete and modern philosophers of mind continue to discuss how subjective qualia and the intentional mental states can be naturally explained 59 60 Then of course there is the problem of Quantum Mechanics which is best understood as a form of perspectivism Scientific study edit Simplified diagram of Spaun a 25millionneuron computational model of the brain A The corresponding physical regions and connections of the human brain B The mental architecture of Spaun 61 Neuroscience edit See also Cognitive neuroscience Thought identification and Epigenetics in learning and memory Neuroscience studies the nervous system the physical basis of the mind At the systems level neuroscientists investigate how biological neural networks form and physiologically interact to produce mental functions and content such as reflexes multisensory integration motor coordination circadian rhythms emotional responses learning and memory The underlying physical basis of learning and memory is likely dynamic changes in gene expression that occur in brain neurons Such expression changes are introduced by epigenetic mechanisms Epigenetic regulation of gene expression ordinarily involves chemical modification of DNA or DNAassociated histone proteins Such chemical modifications can cause longlasting changes in gene expression Epigenetic mechanisms employed in learning and memory include the methylation and demethylation of neuronal DNA as well as methylation acetylation and deacetylation of neuronal histone proteins At a larger scale efforts in computational neuroscience have developed largescale models that simulate simple functioning brains 61 As of 2012 such models include the thalamus basal ganglia prefrontal cortex motor cortex and occipital cortex and consequentially simulated brains can learn respond to visual stimuli coordinate motor responses form shortterm memories and learn to respond to patterns Currently researchers aim to program the hippocampus and limbic system hypothetically imbuing the simulated mind with longterm memory and crude emotions 62 By contrast affective neuroscience studies the neural mechanisms of personality emotion and mood primarily through experimental tasks Cognitive Science edit See also Cognitive Science This section needs expansion You can help by adding to it May 2013 Cognitive science examines the mental functions that give rise to information processing termed cognition These include perception attention working memory longterm memory producing and understanding language learning reasoning problem solving and decision making Cognitive science seeks to understand thinking in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures 63 Psychology edit See also Neuropsychology Psyche and Unconscious mind Psychology is the scientific study of human behavior mental functioning and experience As both an academic and applied discipline Psychology involves the scientific study of mental processes such as perception cognition emotion personality as well as environmental influences such as social and cultural influences and interpersonal relationships in order to devise theories of human behavior Psychological patterns can be understood as low cost ways of information processing 64 Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity including problems of individuals daily lives and the treatment of mental health problems Psychology differs from the other social sciences eg anthropology economics political science and sociology due to its focus on experimentation at the scale of the individual or individuals in small groups as opposed to large groups institutions or societies Historically psychology differed from biology and neuroscience in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain Modern psychological science incorporates physiological and neurological processes into its conceptions of perception cognition behaviour and mental disorders Mental health edit Main article Mental health By analogy with the health of the body one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind or mental health MerriamWebster defines mental health as A state of emotional and psychological wellbeing in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities function in society and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life According to the World Health Organization WHO there is no one official definition of mental health Cultural differences subjective assessments and competing professional theories all affect how mental health is defined In general most experts agree that mental health and mental disorder are not opposites In other words the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health One way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions Feeling capable and competent being able to handle normal levels of stress maintaining satisfying relationships and leading an independent life and being able to bounce back or recover from difficult situations are all signs of mental health Psychotherapy is an interpersonal relational intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid clients in problems of living This usually includes increasing individual sense of wellbeing and reducing subjective discomforting experience Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building dialogue communication and behavior change and that are designed to improve the mental health of a client or patient or to improve group relationships such as in a family Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken conversation though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word art drama narrative story or therapeutic touch Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained therapist and clients Purposeful theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with psychoanalysis since then scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created Nonhuman minds edit Animal intelligence edit Animal cognition or cognitive ethology is the title given to a modern approach to the mental capacities of animals It has developed out of comparative psychology but has also been strongly influenced by the approach of ethology behavioral ecology and evolutionary psychology Much of what used to be considered under the title of animal intelligence is now thought of under this heading Animal language acquisition attempting to discern or understand the degree to which animal cognition can be revealed by linguistics related study has been controversial among cognitive linguists Artificial intelligence edit This section needs additional citations for verification Please

published Computing machinery and intelligence in Mind in which he proposed that machines could be tested for intelligence using questions and answers This process is now named the Turing Test The term Artificial Intelligence AI was first used by John McCarthy who considered it to mean the science and engineering of making intelligent machines 66 It can also refer to intelligence as exhibited by an artificial manmade nonnatural manufactured entity AI is studied in overlapping fields of computer science psychology neuroscience and engineering dealing with intelligent behavior learning and adaptation and usually developed using customized machines or computers Research in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior Examples include control planning and scheduling the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions handwriting natural language speech and facial recognition As such the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline focused on providing solutions to real life problems knowledge mining software applications strategy games like computer chess and other video games One of the biggest limitations of AI is in the domain of actual machine comprehension Consequentially natural language understanding and connectionism where behavior of neural networks is investigated are areas of active research and development The debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of artificial intelligence If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine if it were possible at all If on the other hand the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind though possibly only with computers much different from todays by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain In religion edit Many religions associate spiritual qualities to the human mind These are often tightly connected to their mythology and ideas of afterlife The Indian philosopher sage Sri Aurobindo attempted to unite the Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his integral psychology as have many philosophers and New religious movements Judaism teaches that moach shalit al halev the mind rules the heart Humans can approach the Divine intellectually through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah and use that deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer Christianity has tended to see the mind as distinct from the soul Greek nous and sometimes further distinguished from the spirit Western esoteric traditions sometimes refer to a mental body that exists on a plane other than the physical Hinduism s various philosophical schools have debated whether the human soul Sanskrit atman is distinct from or identical to Brahman the divine reality Taoism sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces and the mind as not separate from the body Confucianism sees the mind like the body as inherently perfectible Buddhism edit See also Buddhism and psychology Vijñāna Śūnyatā Shentong Rangtong and Yogacara Buddhist teachings explain the momenttomoment manifestation of the mindstream 8 9 The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates ie material form feelings perception volition and sensory consciousness which arise and pass away continuously The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws biological laws psychological laws physical laws volitional laws and universal laws 9 8 The Buddhist practice of mindfulness involves attending to this constantly changing mindstream According to Buddhist philosopher Dharmakirti the mind has two fundamental qualities clarity and cognizes If something is not those two qualities it cannot validly be called mind Clarity refers to the fact that mind has no color shape size location weight or any other physical characteristic and cognizes that it functions to know or perceive objects 67 Knowing refers to the fact that mind is aware of the contents of experience and that in order to exist mind must be cognizing an object You cannot have a mind whose function is to cognize an object existing without cognizing an object Mind in Buddhism is also described as being spacelike and illusionlike Mind is spacelike in the sense that it is not physically obstructive It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing In Mahayana Buddhism mind is illusionlike in the sense that it is empty of inherent existence This does not mean it does not exist it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist according to Buddhism When the mind is itself cognized properly without misperceiving its mode of existence it appears to exist like an illusion There is a big difference however between being space and illusion and being spacelike and illusionlike Mind is not composed of space it just shares some descriptive similarities to space Mind is not an illusion it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions Buddhism posits that there is no inherent unchanging identity Inherent I Inherent Me or phenomena Ultimate self inherent self Atman Soul Selfessence Jiva Ishvara humanness essence etc which is the experiencer of our experiences and the agent of our actions In other words human beings consist of merely a body and a mind and nothing extra Within the body there is no part or set of parts which is by itself or themselves the person Similarly within the mind there is no part or set of parts which are themselves the person A human being merely consists of five aggregates or skandhas and nothing else In the same way mind is what can be validly conceptually labelled onto our mere experience of clarity and knowing There is something separate and apart from clarity and knowing which is Awareness in Buddhism Mind is that part of experience the sixth sense door which can be validly referred to as mind by the conceptterm mind There is also not objects out there mind in here and experience somewhere inbetween There is a third thing called awareness which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes There are five senses arising of mere experience shapes colors the components of smell components of taste components of sound components of touch and mind as the sixth institution this means expressly that there can be a third thing called awareness and a third thing called experiencer who is aware of the experience This awareness is deeply related to noself because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion Clearly the experience arises and is known by mind but there is a third thing calls Sati what is the real experiencer of the experience that sits apart from the experience and which can be aware of the experience in 4 levels Maha Sathipatthana Sutta Body Sensations Changes of the body mind Mind Contents of the mind Changes of the body mind To be aware of these four levels one needs to cultivate equanimity toward Craving and Aversion This is Called Vipassana which is different from the way of reacting with Craving and Aversion This is the state of being aware and equanimous to the complete experience of here and now This is the way of Buddhism with regards to mind and the ultimate nature of minds and persons Mortality of the mind edit Main article Consciousness after death Due to the mindbody problem a lot of interest and debate surrounds the question of what happens to ones conscious mind as ones body dies During brain death all brain function permanently ceases According to some neuroscientific views which see these processes as the physical basis of mental phenomena the mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist This permanent loss of consciousness after death is sometimes called eternal oblivion The belief that some spiritual or incorporeal component soul exists and that it is preserved after death is described by the term afterlife In pseudoscience edit Parapsychology edit Parapsychology is a study of certain types of paranormal phenomena or of phenomena which appear to be paranormal or not have any scientific basis 68 for instance precognition telekinesis and telepathy The term is based on the Greek para besidebeyond psyche soulmind and logos accountexplanation and was coined by psychologist Max Dessoir in or before 1889 69 JB Rhine tried to popularize parapsychology using fraudulent techniques as a replacement for the earlier term psychical research during a shift in methodologies which brought experimental methods to the study of psychic phenomena 69 Parapsychology is not accepted among the scientific community as science as psychic abilities have not been demonstrated to exist 70 71 72 73 74 The status of parapsychology as a science has also been disputed 75 with many scientists regarding the discipline as pseudoscience 76 77 78 See also edit Outline of human intelligence topic tree presenting the traits capacities models and research fields of human intelligence and more
