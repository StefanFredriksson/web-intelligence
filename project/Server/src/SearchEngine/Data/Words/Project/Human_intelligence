construct and measured by intelligence tests intelligence is considered to be one of the most useful concepts used in psychology because it correlates with many relevant variables for instance the probability of suffering an accident salary and more 2 Education According to a 2018 metastudy of educational effects on intelligence education appears to be the most consistent robust and durable method known for raising intelligence 3 Myopia A number of studies have shown a correlation between IQ and myopia 4 Some suggest that the reason for the correlation is environmental whereby intelligent people are more likely to damage their eyesight with prolonged reading while others contend that a genetic link exists 5 Aging There is evidence that aging causes decline in cognitive functions In one crosssectional study various cognitive functions measured declines by about 08 in zscore from age 20 to age 50 the cognitive functions included speed of processing working memory and long term memory 6 Genes A number of singlenucleotide polymorphisms in human DNA are correlated with intelligence 7 Theories edit Relevance of IQ tests edit In psychology human intelligence is commonly assessed by IQ scores determined by IQ tests However there are critics of IQ who do not dispute the stability of IQ test scores or the fact that they predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively They do argue however that to base a concept of intelligence on IQ test scores alone is to ignore many important aspects of mental ability 8 On the other hand Linda S Gottfredson 2006 has argued that the results of thousands of studies support the importance of IQ for school and job performance see also the work of Schmidt Hunter 2004 She says that IQ also predicts or correlates with numerous other life outcomes In contrast empirical support for non g intelligences is lacking or very poor 9 Theory of multiple intelligences edit Main article Theory of multiple intelligences Howard Gardner s theory of multiple intelligences is based on studies not only of normal children and adults but also of gifted individuals including socalled savants of persons who have suffered brain damage of experts and virtuosos and of individuals from diverse cultures Gardner breaks intelligence down into at least a number of different components In the first edition of his book Frames of Mind 1983 he described seven distinct types of intelligencelogicalmathematical linguistic spatial musical kinesthetic interpersonal and intrapersonal In a second edition of this book he added two more types of intelligencenaturalist and existential intelligences He argues that psychometric IQ tests address only linguistic and logical plus some aspects of spatial intelligence 8 A major criticism of Gardners theory is that it has never been tested or subjected to peer review by Gardner or anyone else and indeed that it is unfalsifiable 10 Others eg Locke 2005 have suggested that recognizing many specific forms of intelligence specific aptitude theory implies a politicalrather than scientificagenda intended to appreciate the uniqueness in all individuals rather than recognizing potentially true and meaningful differences in individual capacities Schmidt and Hunter 2004 suggest that the predictive validity of specific aptitudes over and above that of general mental ability or g has not received empirical support On the other hand Jerome Bruner agreed with Gardner that the intelligences were useful fictions and went on to state that his approach is so far beyond the datacrunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered 11 Howard Gardner describes his first seven intelligences as follows 12 Linguistic intelligence People high in linguistic intelligence have an affinity for words both spoken and written Logicalmathematical intelligence It implies logical and mathematical abilities Spatial intelligence The ability to form a mental model of a spatial world and to be able to maneuver and operate using that model Musical intelligence Those with musical intelligence have excellent pitch and may even be absolute pitch Bodilykinesthetic intelligence The ability to solve problems or to fashion products using ones whole body or parts of the body Gifted people in this intelligence may be good dancers athletes surgeons craftspeople and others Interpersonal intelligence The ability to see things from the perspective of others or to understand people in the sense of empathy Strong interpersonal intelligence would be an asset in those who are teachers politicians clinicians religious leaders etc Intrapersonal intelligence It is a capacity to form an accurate veridical model of oneself and to be able to use that model to operate effectively in life Triarchic theory of intelligence edit Main article Triarchic theory of intelligence Robert Sternberg proposed the triarchic theory of intelligence to provide a more comprehensive description of intellectual competence than traditional differential or cognitive theories of human ability 13 The triarchic theory describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence Analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed Creative intelligence is necessary when an individual is confronted with a challenge that is nearly but not entirely novel or when an individual is engaged in automatizing the performance of a task Practical intelligence is bound in a sociocultural milieu and involves adaptation to selection of and shaping of the environment to maximize fit in the context The triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor instead the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood More recently the triarchic theory has been updated and renamed as the Theory of Successful Intelligence by Sternberg 14 15 Intelligence is now defined as an individuals assessment of success in life by the individuals own idiographic standards and within the individuals sociocultural context Success is achieved by using combinations of analytical creative and practical intelligence The three aspects of intelligence are referred to as processing skills The processing skills are applied to the pursuit of success through what were the three elements of practical intelligence adapting to shaping of and selecting of ones environments The mechanisms that employ the processing skills to achieve success include utilizing ones strengths and compensating or correcting for ones weaknesses Sternbergs theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community 16 17 18 19 PASS theory of intelligence edit Main article PASS Theory of Intelligence Based on A R Luria s 1966 20 seminal work on the modularization of brain function and supported by decades of neuroimaging research the PASS Theory of Intelligence 21 proposes that cognition is organized in three systems and four processes The first process is the Planning which involves executive functions responsible for controlling and organizing behavior selecting and constructing strategies and monitoring performance The second is the Attention process which is responsible for maintaining arousal levels and alertness and ensuring focus on relevant stimuli The next two are called Simultaneous and Successive processing and they involve encoding transforming and retaining information Simultaneous processing is engaged when the relationship between items and their integration into whole units of information is required Examples of this include recognizing figures such as a triangle within a circle vs a circle within a triangle or the difference between he had a shower before breakfast and he had breakfast before a shower Successive processing is required for organizing separate items in a sequence such as remembering a sequence of words or actions exactly in the order in which they had just been presented These four processes are functions of four areas of the brain Planning is broadly located in the front part of our brains the frontal lobe Attention and arousal are combined functions of the frontal lobe and the lower parts of the cortex although the parietal lobes are also involved in attention as well Simultaneous processing and Successive processing occur in the posterior region or the back of the brain Simultaneous processing is broadly associated with the occipital and the parietal lobes while Successive processing is broadly associated with the frontaltemporal lobes The PASS PlanningAttentionSimultaneousSuccessive theory is heavily indebted to both Luria 1966 20 1973 22 and studies in cognitive psychology involved in promoting a better look at intelligence 23 Piagets theory and NeoPiagetian theories edit Main articles Piagets theory of cognitive development and NeoPiagetian theories of cognitive development In Piagets theory of cognitive development the focus is not on mental abilities but rather on a childs mental models of the world As a child develops increasingly more accurate models of the world are developed which enable the child to interact with the world better One example being object permanence where the child develops a model where objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen heard or touched Piagets theory described four main stages and many substages in the development These four main stages are sensory motor stage birth2yrs preoperational stage 2yrs7rs concrete operational stage 7rs11yrs and formal operations stage 11yrs16yrs 24 Degree of progress through these stages are correlated but not identical with psychometric IQ 25 26 Piaget conceptualizes intelligence as an activity more than a capacity One of Piagets most famous studies focused purely on the discriminative abilities of children between the ages of two and a half years old and four and a half years old He began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets one with the sweets in a line spread further apart and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together He found that Children between 2 years 6 months old and 3 years 2 months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have more after 4 years 6 months they again discriminate correctly 27 Initially younger children were not studied because if at the age of four years a child could not conserve quantity then a younger child presumably could not either The results show however that children that are younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation but as they get older they lose this quality and do not recover it until four and a half years old This attribute may be lost temporarily because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy or because of the inability for a fouryearold to reverse situations 24 By the end of this experiment several results were found First younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than acknowledged This study also reveals that young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations depending on how logical the structure of the task is Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age 5 and as a result the child will count the sweets to decide which has more Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans native inheritance 24 Piagets theory has been criticized for the age of appearance of a new model of the world such as object permanence being dependent on how the testing is done see the article on object permanence More generally the theory may be very difficult to test empirically because of the difficulty of proving or disproving that a mental model is the explanation for the results of the testing 28 NeoPiagetian theories of cognitive development expand Piagets theory in various ways such as also considering psychometriclike factors such as processing speed and working memory hypercognitive factors like selfmonitoring more stages and more consideration on how progress may vary in different domains such as spatial or social 29 30 Parietofrontal integration theory of intelligence edit Main article Parietofrontal integration theory Based on a review of 37 neuroimaging studies Jung and Haier 2007 proposed that the biological basis of intelligence stems from how well the frontal and parietal regions of the brain communicate and exchange information with each other 31 Subsequent neuroimaging and lesion studies report general consensus with the theory 32 33 34 A review of the neuroscience and intelligence literature concludes that the parietofrontal integration theory is the best available explanation for human intelligence differences 35 Investment theory edit Based on the CattellHornCarroll theory the tests of intelligence most often used in the relevant studies include measures of fluid ability Gf and crystallized ability Gc that differ in their trajectory of development in individuals 36 The investment theory by Cattell 37 states that the individual differences observed in the procurement of skills and knowledge Gc are partially attributed to the investment of Gf thus suggesting the involvement of fluid intelligence in every aspect of the learning process 38 It is essential to highlight that the investment theory suggests that personality traits affect actual ability and not scores on an IQ test 39 In association Hebbs theory of intelligence suggested a bifurcation as well Intelligence A physiological that could be seen as a semblance of fluid intelligence and Intelligence B experiential similar to crystallized intelligence 40 Intelligence compensation theory ICT edit The intelligence compensation theory a term first coined by Wood and Englert 2009 41 states that individuals who are comparatively less intelligent work harder more methodically become more resolute and thorough more conscientious in order to achieve goals to compensate for their lack of intelligence whereas more intelligent individuals do not require traitsbehaviours associated with the personality factor conscientiousness to progress as they can rely on the strength of their cognitive abilities as opposed to structure or effort 42 43 The theory suggests the existence of a causal relationship between intelligence and conscientiousness such that the development of the personality trait conscientiousness is influenced by intelligence This assumption is deemed plausible as it is unlikely that the reverse causal relationship could occur 44 implying that the negative correlation would be higher between fluid intelligence Gf and conscientiousness The justification being the timeline of development of Gf Gc and personality as crystallized intelligence would not have developed completely when personality traits develop Subsequently during schoolgoing ages more conscientious children would be expected to gain more crystallized intelligence knowledge through education as they would be more efficient thorough hardworking and dutiful 45 This theory has recently been contradicted by evidence that identifies compensatory sample selection Thus attributing the previous findings to the bias in selecting samples with individuals above a certain threshold of achievement 46 Banduras theory of selfefficacy and cognition edit The view of cognitive ability has evolved over the years and it is no longer viewed as a fixed property held by an individual Instead the current perspective describes it as a general capacity comprising not only cognitive but motivational social and behavioural aspects as well These facets work together to perform numerous tasks An essential skill often overlooked is that of managing emotions and aversive experiences that can compromise ones quality of thought and activity The link between intelligence and success has been bridged by crediting individual differences in selfefficacy Banduras theory identifies the difference between possessing skills and being able to apply them in challenging situations Thus the theory suggests that individuals with the same level of knowledge and skill may perform badly averagely or excellently based on differences in selfefficacy A key role of cognition is to allow for one to predict events and in turn devise methods to deal with these events effectively These skills are dependent on processing of stimuli that is unclear and ambiguous To learn the relevant concepts individuals must be able to rely on the reserve of knowledge to identify develop and execute options They must be able to apply the learning acquired from previous experiences Thus a stable sense of selfefficacy is essential to stay focused on tasks in the face of challenging situations 47 To summarize Banduras theory of selfefficacy and intelligence suggests that individuals with a relatively low sense of selfefficacy in any field will avoid challenges This effect is heightened when they perceive the situations as personal threats When failure occurs they recover from it more slowly than others and credit it to an insufficient aptitude On the other hand persons with high levels of selfefficacy hold a taskdiagnostic aim that leads to effective performance 48 Process personality intelligence and knowledge theory PPIK edit This section needs expansion with more extensive and clear explanations You can help by adding to it March 2018 Predicted growth curves for Intelligence as process crystallized intelligence occupational knowledge and avocational knowledge based on Ackermans PPIK Theory citation needed Developed by Ackerman the PPIK process personality intelligence and knowledge theory further develops the approach on intelligence as proposed by Cattell the Investment theory and Hebb suggesting a distinction between intelligence as knowledge and intelligence as process two concepts that are comparable and related to Gc and Gf respectively but broader and closer to Hebbs notions of Intelligence A and Intelligence B and integrating these factors with elements such as personality motivation and interests 49 50 Ackerman describes the difficulty of distinguishing process from knowledge as content cannot be entirely eliminated from any ability test 49 50 51 Personality traits have not shown to be significantly correlated with the intelligence as process aspect except in the context of psychopathology One exception to this generalization has been the finding of sex differences in cognitive abilities specifically abilities in mathematical and spatial form 49 52 On the other hand the intelligence as knowledge factor has been associated with personality traits of Openness and Typical Intellectual Engagement 49 53 54 which also strongly correlate with verbal abilities associated with crystallized intelligence 49 Latent inhibition edit Main article Latent inhibition It appears that Latent inhibition can influence ones creativity Improving edit Further information Neuroenhancement and Intelligence amplification Because intelligence appears to be at least partly dependent on brain structure and the genes shaping brain development it has been proposed that genetic engineering could be used to enhance the intelligence a process sometimes called biological uplift in science fiction Experiments on mice have demonstrated superior ability in learning and memory in various behavioral tasks 55 IQ leads to greater success in education 56 but independently education raises IQ scores 57 A 2017 metaanalysis suggests education increases IQ by 15 points per year of education or at least increases IQ test taking ability 58 Attempts to raise IQ with brain training have led to increases on aspects related with the training tasks for instance working memory but it is yet unclear if these increases generalise to increased intelligence per se 59 60 A 2008 research paper claimed that practicing a dual nback task can increase fluid intelligence Gf as measured in several different standard tests 61 This finding received some attention from popular media including an article in Wired 62 However a subsequent criticism of the papers methodology questioned the experiments validity and took issue with the lack of uniformity in the tests used to evaluate the control and test groups 63 For example the progressive nature of Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices APM test may have been compromised by modifications of time restrictions ie 10 minutes were allowed to complete a normally 45minute test Substances which actually or purportedly improve intelligence or other mental functions are called nootropics A meta analysis shows omega 3 fatty acids improves cognitive performance among those with cognitive deficits but not among healthy subjects 64 A metaregression shows omega 3 fatty acids improve the moods of patients with major depression major depression is associated with mental deficits 65 However exercise not just performanceenhancing drugs enhances cognition for healthy and non healthy subjects as well 66 On the philosophical front conscious efforts to influence intelligence raise ethical issues Neuroethics considers the ethical legal and social implications of neuroscience and deals with issues such as the difference between treating a human neurological disease and enhancing the human brain and how wealth impacts access to neurotechnology Neuroethical issues interact with the ethics of human genetic engineering Transhumanist theorists study the possibilities and consequences of developing and using techniques to enhance human abilities and aptitudes Eugenics is a social philosophy which advocates the improvement of human hereditary traits through various forms of intervention 67 Eugenics has variously been regarded as meritorious or deplorable in different periods of history falling greatly into disrepute after the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II citation needed Measuring edit Main article Intelligence quotient Further information Psychometrics Score distribution chart for sample of 905 children tested on 1916 StanfordBinet Test The approach to understanding intelligence with the most supporters and published research over the longest period of time is based on psychometric testing It is also by far the most widely used in practical settings 8 Intelligence quotient IQ tests include the StanfordBinet Ravens Progressive Matrices the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children There are also psychometric tests that are not intended to measure intelligence itself but some closely related construct such as scholastic aptitude In the United States examples include the SSAT the SAT the ACT the GRE the MCAT the LSAT and the GMAT 8 Regardless of the method used almost any test that requires examinees to reason and has a wide range of question difficulty will produce intelligence scores that are approximately normally distributed in the general population 68 69 Intelligence tests are widely used in educational 70 business and military settings because of their efficacy in predicting behavior IQ and g discussed in the next section are correlated with many important social outcomesindividuals with low IQs are more likely to be divorced have a child out of marriage be incarcerated and need longterm welfare support while individuals with high IQs are associated with more years of education higher status jobs and higher income 71 Intelligence is significantly correlated with successful training and performance outcomes and IQ g is the single best predictor of successful job performance 8 72 General intelligence factor or g edit Main article g factor psychometrics There are many different kinds of IQ tests using a wide variety of test tasks Some tests consist of a single type of task others rely on a broad collection of tasks with different contents visualspatial 73 verbal numerical and asking for different cognitive processes eg reasoning memory rapid decisions visual comparisons spatial imagery reading and retrieval of general knowledge The psychologist Charles Spearman early in the 20th century carried out the first formal factor analysis of correlations between various test tasks He found a trend for all such tests to correlate positively with each other which is called a positive manifold Spearman found that a single common factor explained the positive correlations among tests Spearman named it g for general intelligence factor He interpreted it as the core of human intelligence that to a larger or smaller degree influences success in all cognitive tasks and thereby creates the positive manifold This interpretation of g as a common cause of test performance is still dominant in psychometrics Although an alternative interpretation was recently advanced by van der Maas and colleagues 74 Their mutualism model assumes that intelligence depends on several independent mechanisms none of which influences performance on all cognitive tests These mechanisms support each other so that efficient operation of one of them makes efficient operation of the others more likely thereby creating the positive manifold IQ tasks and tests can be ranked by how highly they load on the g factor Tests with high g loadings are those that correlate highly with most other tests One comprehensive study investigating the correlations between a large collection of tests and tasks 75 has found that the Ravens Progressive Matrices have a particularly high correlation with most other tests and tasks The Ravens is a test of inductive reasoning with abstract visual material It consists of a series of problems sorted approximately by increasing difficulty Each problem presents a 3 x 3 matrix of abstract designs with one empty cell the matrix is constructed according to a rule and the person must find out the rule to determine which of 8 alternatives fits into the empty cell Because of its high correlation with other tests the Ravens Progressive Matrices are generally acknowledged as a good indicator of general intelligence This is problematic however because there are substantial gender differences on the Ravens 76 which are not found when g is measured directly by computing the general factor from a broad collection of tests 77 General collective intelligence factor or c edit Main article Collective intelligence A recent scientific understanding of collective intelligence defined as a groups general ability to perform a wide range of tasks 78 expands the areas of human intelligence research applying similar methods and concepts to groups Definition operationalization and methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence where an individuals performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure intelligence indicated by the general intelligence factor g extracted via factor analysis 79 In the same vein collective intelligence research aims to discover a c factor explaining betweengroup differences in performance as well as structural and group compositional causes for it 80 Historical psychometric theories edit Main article Intelligence quotient History Several different theories of intelligence have historically been important for psychometrics Often they emphasized more factors than a single one like in g factor CattellHornCarroll theory edit Main article CattellHornCarroll theory Many of the broad recent IQ tests have been greatly influenced by the CattellHornCarroll theory It is argued to reflect much of what is known about intelligence from research A hierarchy of factors for human intelligence is used g is at the top Under it there are 10 broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into 70 narrow abilities The broad abilities are 81 Fluid intelligence Gf includes the broad ability to reason form concepts and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures Crystallized intelligence Gc includes the breadth and depth of a persons acquired knowledge the ability to communicate ones knowledge and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures Quantitative reasoning Gq the ability to comprehend quantitative concepts and relationships and to manipulate numerical symbols Reading writing ability Grw includes basic reading and writing skills Shortterm memory Gsm is the ability to apprehend and hold information in immediate awareness and then use it within a few seconds Longterm storage and retrieval Glr is the ability to store information and fluently retrieve it later in the process of thinking Visual processing Gv is the ability to perceive analyze synthesize and think with visual patterns including the ability to store and recall visual representations Auditory processing Ga is the ability to analyze synthesize and discriminate auditory stimuli including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions Processing speed Gs is the ability to perform automatic cognitive tasks particularly when measured under pressure to maintain focused attention Decisionreaction timespeed Gt reflect the immediacy with which an individual can react to stimuli or a task typically measured in seconds or fractions of seconds not to be confused with Gs which typically is measured in intervals of 23 minutes See Mental chronometry Modern tests do not necessarily measure of all of these broad abilities For example Gq and Grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not IQ 81 Gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment g was earlier often subdivided into only Gf and Gc which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular Wechsler IQ test More recent research has shown the situation to be more complex 81 Controversies edit While not necessarily a dispute about the psychometric approach itself there are several controversies regarding the results from psychometric research One criticism has been against the early research such as craniometry 82 A reply has been that drawing conclusions from early intelligence research is like condemning the auto industry by criticizing the performance of the Model T 83 Several critics such as Stephen Jay Gould have been critical of g seeing it as a statistical artifact and that IQ tests instead measure a number of unrelated abilities 82 84 The American Psychological Associations report Intelligence Knowns and Unknowns stated that IQ tests do correlate and that the view that g is a statistical artifact is a minority one Intelligence across cultures edit Psychologists have shown that the definition of human intelligence is unique to the culture that one is studying Robert Sternberg is among the researchers who have discussed how ones culture affects the persons interpretation of intelligence and he further believes that to define intelligence in only one way without considering different meanings in cultural contexts may cast an investigative and unintentionally egocentric view on the world To negate this psychologists offer the following definitions of intelligence Successful intelligence is the skills and knowledge needed for success in life according to ones own definition of success within ones sociocultural context Analytical intelligence is the result of intelligences components applied to fairly abstract but familiar kinds of problems Creative intelligence is the result of intelligences components applied to relatively novel tasks and situations Practical intelligence is the result of intelligences components applied to experience for purposes of adaption shaping and selection 85 Although typically identified by its western definition multiple studies support the idea that human intelligence carries different meanings across cultures around the world In many Eastern cultures intelligence is mainly related with ones social roles and responsibilities A Chinese conception of intelligence would define it as the ability to empathize with and understand others although this is by no means the only way that intelligence is defined in China In several African communities intelligence is shown similarly through a social lens However rather than through social roles as in many Eastern cultures it is exemplified through social responsibilities For example in the language of ChiChewa which is spoken by some ten million people across central Africa the equivalent term for intelligence implies not only cleverness but also the ability to take on responsibility Furthermore within American culture there are a variety of interpretations of intelligence present as well One of the most common views on intelligence within American societies defines it as a combination of problemsolving skills deductive reasoning skills and Intelligence quotient IQ while other American societies point out that intelligent people should have a social conscience accept others for who they are and be able to give advice or wisdom 86 See also edit Genius Intellect
