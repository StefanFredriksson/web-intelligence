Multivalued Implicit v t e In mathematics a function note 1 is a relation between sets that associates to every element of a first set exactly one element of the second set Typical examples are functions from integers to integers or from the real numbers to real numbers Functions were originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another quantity For example the position of a planet is a function of time Historically the concept was elaborated with the infinitesimal calculus at the end of the 17th century and until the 19th century the functions that were considered were differentiable that is they had a high degree of regularity The concept of function was formalized at the end of the 19th century in terms of set theory and this greatly enlarged the domains of application of the concept A function is a process or a relation that associates each element x of a set X the domain of the function to a single element y of another set Y possibly the same set the codomain of the function If the function is called f this relation is denoted y f x which is spoken aloud as f of x the element x is the argument or input of the function and y is the value of the function the output or the image of x by f 1 The symbol that is used for representing the input is the variable of the function one often says that f is a function of the variable x A function is uniquely represented by the set of all pairs x f x called the graph of the function note 2 When the domain and the codomain are sets of real numbers each such pair may be considered as the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane The set of these points is called the graph of the function it is a popular means to illustrate the function Functions are widely used in science and in most fields of mathematics It has been said that functions are the central objects of investigation in most fields of mathematics 2 Schematic depiction of a function described metaphorically as a machine or black box that for each input yields a corresponding output The red curve is the graph of a function because any vertical line has exactly one crossing point with the curve A function that associates any of

is defined by the set of ordered pairs 1D 2C 3C The imagerange is the set CD This diagram representing the set of pairs 1D 2B 2C does not define a function One reason is that 2 is the first element in more than one ordered pair 2B and 2C of this set Two other reasons also sufficient by themselves is that neither 3 nor 4 are first elements input of any ordered pair therein Intuitively a function is a process that associates to each element of a set X a single element of a set Y Formally a function f from a set X to a set Y is defined by a set G of ordered pairs x y such that x X y Y and every element of X is the first component of exactly one ordered pair in G 3 note 3 In other words for every x in X there is exactly one element y such that the ordered pair x y belongs to the set of pairs defining the function f The set G is called the graph of the function Formally speaking it may be identified with the function but this hides the usual interpretation of a function as a process Therefore in common usage the function is generally distinguished from its graph Functions are also called maps or mappings though some authors make some distinction between maps and functions see section Map In the definition of function X and Y are respectively called the domain and the codomain of the function f If x y belongs to the set defining f then y is the image of x under f or the value of f applied to the argument x Especially in the context of numbers one says also that y is the value of f for the value x of its variable or still shorter y is the value of f of x denoted as y f x Two functions f and g are equal if their domain and codomain sets are the same and their output values agree on the whole domain Formally f g if f x g x for all x X where f X Y and g X Y 4 5 note 4 The domain and codomain are not always explicitly given when a function is defined and without some possibly difficult computation one knows only that the domain is contained in a larger set Typically this occurs in mathematical analysis where a function from X to Y often refers to a function that may have a proper subset of X as domain For example a function from the reals to the reals may refer to a realvalued function of a real variable and this phrase does not mean that the domain of the function is the whole set of the real numbers but only that the domain is a set of real numbers that contains a nonempty open interval such a function is then called a partial function For example if f is a function that has the real numbers as domain and codomain then a function mapping the value x to the value g x 1 f x displaystyle gxtfrac 1fx is a function g from the reals to the reals whose domain is the set of the reals x such that f x 0 The range of a function is the set of the images of all elements in the domain However range is sometimes used as a synonym of codomain generally in old textbooks citation needed Relational approach edit Any subset of the Cartesian product of two sets X displaystyle X and Y displaystyle Y defines a binary relation R X Y displaystyle Rsubseteq Xtimes Y between these two sets It is immediate that an arbitrary relation may contain pairs that violate the necessary conditions for a function given above A univalent or functional relation is a relation such that x y R x z R y z displaystyle xyin Rland xzin Rimplies yz for all x displaystyle x in X displaystyle X and y z displaystyle yz in Y displaystyle Y Univalent relations may be identified with functions with codomain Y displaystyle Y whose domain is a subset of X A total relation is a relation such that x X y Y x y R displaystyle forall xin Xexists yin Yxyin R Formally functions are identified as relations that are both univalent and total Univalent relations that are not total are called partial functions Various properties of functions and function composition may be reformulated in the language of relations For example a function is injective if the converse relation R T Y X displaystyle RtextTsubseteq Ytimes X is univalent where the converse relation is defined as R T y x x y R displaystyle RtextTyxmid xyin R 6 As an element of a Cartesian product over a domain edit The set of all functions from some given domain to a codomain is sometimes identified with the Cartesian product of copies of the codomain indexed by the domain Namely given sets X displaystyle X and Y displaystyle Y any function f X Y displaystyle fcolon Xto Y is an element of the Cartesian product of copies of Y displaystyle Y s over the index set X displaystyle X f X Y Y X displaystyle fin prod XYYX Viewing f displaystyle f as tuple with coordinates then for each x X displaystyle xin X the x displaystyle x th coordinate of this tuple is the value f x Y displaystyle fxin Y This reflects the intuition that for each x X displaystyle xin X the function picks some element y Y displaystyle yin Y namely f x displaystyle fx This point of view is used for example in the discussion of a choice function Infinite Cartesian products are often simply defined as sets of functions 7 Notation edit There are various standard ways for denoting functions The most commonly used notation is functional notation which defines the function using an equation that gives the names of the function and the argument explicitly This gives rise to a subtle point often glossed over in elementary treatments of functions functions are distinct from their values Thus a function f should be distinguished from its value f x 0 at the value x 0 in its domain To some extent even working mathematicians will conflate the two in informal settings for convenience and to avoid appearing pedantic However strictly speaking it is an abuse of notation to write let f R R displaystyle fcolon mathbb R to mathbb R be the function f x x 2 since f x and x 2 should both be understood as the value of f at x rather than the function itself Instead it is correct though longwinded to write let f R R displaystyle fcolon mathbb R to mathbb R be the function defined by the equation f x x 2 valid for all real values of x A compact phrasing is let f R R displaystyle fcolon mathbb R to mathbb R with f x x 2 where the redundant be the function is omitted and by convention for all x displaystyle x in the domain of f displaystyle f is understood This distinction in language and notation becomes important in cases where functions themselves serve as inputs for other functions A function taking another function as an input is termed a functional Other approaches to denoting functions detailed below avoid this problem but are less commonly used Functional notation edit As first used by Leonhard Euler in 1734 8 functions are denoted by a symbol consisting generally of a single letter in italic font most often the lowercase letters f g h Some widely used functions are represented by a symbol consisting of several letters usually two or three generally an abbreviation of their name By convention in this case a roman type is used such as sin for the sine function in contrast to italic font for singleletter symbols The notation read y equals f of x y f x displaystyle yfx means that the pair x y belongs to the set of pairs defining the function f If X is the domain of f the set of pairs defining the function is thus using setbuilder notation x f x x X displaystyle xfxxin X Often a definition of the function is given by what f does to the explicit argument x For example a function f can be defined by the equation f x sin x 2 1 displaystyle fxsinx21 for all real numbers x In this example f can be thought of as the composite of several simpler functions squaring adding 1 and taking the sine However only the sine function has a common explicit symbol sin while the combination of squaring and then adding 1 is described by the polynomial expression x 2 1 displaystyle x21 In order to explicitly reference functions such as squaring or adding 1 without introducing new function names eg by defining function g and h by g x x 2 displaystyle gxx2 and h x x 1 displaystyle hxx1 one of the methods below arrow notation or dot notation could be used Sometimes the parentheses of functional notation are omitted when the symbol denoting the function consists of several characters and no ambiguity may arise For example sin x displaystyle sin x can be written instead of sin x displaystyle sinx Arrow notation edit For explicitly expressing domain X and the codomain Y of a function f the arrow notation is often used read the function f from X to Y or the function f mapping elements of X to elements of Y f X Y displaystyle fcolon Xto Y or X f Y displaystyle Xstackrel fto Y This is often used in relation with the arrow notation for elements read f maps x to f x often stacked immediately below the arrow notation giving the function symbol domain and codomain x f x displaystyle xmapsto fx For example if a multiplication is defined on a set X then the square function sqr displaystyle operatorname sqr on X is unambiguously defined by read the function sqr displaystyle operatorname sqr from X to X that maps x to x x sqr X X x x x displaystyle beginalignedoperatorname sqr colon Xto Xxmapsto xcdot xendaligned the latter line being more commonly written x x 2 displaystyle xmapsto x2 Often the expression giving the function symbol domain and codomain is omitted Thus the arrow notation is useful for avoiding introducing a symbol for a function that is defined as it is often the case by a formula expressing the value of the function in terms of its argument As a common application of the arrow notation suppose f X X Y x t f x t displaystyle fcolon Xtimes Xto Yxtmapsto fxt is a twoargument function and we want to refer to a partially applied function X Y displaystyle Xto Y produced by fixing the second argument to the value t 0 without introducing a new function name The map in question could be denoted x f x t 0 displaystyle xmapsto fxt0 using the arrow notation for elements The expression x f x t 0 displaystyle xmapsto fxt0 read the map taking x to f x t 0 displaystyle fxt0 represents this new function with just one argument whereas the expression f x 0 t 0 displaystyle fx0t0 refers to the value of the function f at the point x 0 t 0 displaystyle x0t0 Index notation edit Index notation is often used instead of functional notation That is instead of writing f x one writes f x displaystyle fx This is typically the case for functions whose domain is the set of the natural numbers Such a function is called a sequence and in this case the element f n displaystyle fn is called the n th element of sequence The index notation is also often used for distinguishing some variables called parameters from the true variables In fact parameters are specific variables that are considered as being fixed during the study of a problem For example the map x f x t displaystyle xmapsto fxt see above would be denoted f t displaystyle ft using index notation if we define the collection of maps f t displaystyle ft by the formula f t x f x t displaystyle ftxfxt for all x t X displaystyle xtin X Dot notation edit In the notation x f x displaystyle xmapsto fx the symbol x does not represent any value it is simply a placeholder meaning that if x is replaced by any value on the left of the arrow it should be replaced by the same value on the right of the arrow Therefore x may be replaced by any symbol often an interpunct This may be useful for distinguishing the function f from its value f x at x For example a 2 displaystyle acdot 2 may stand for the function x a x 2 displaystyle xmapsto ax2 and a f u d u displaystyle textstyle int acdot fudu may stand for a function defined by an integral with variable upper bound x a x f u d u displaystyle textstyle xmapsto int axfudu Specialized notations edit There are other specialized notations for functions in subdisciplines of mathematics For example in linear algebra and functional analysis linear forms and the vectors they act upon are denoted using a dual pair to show the underlying duality This is similar to the use of braket notation in quantum mechanics In logic and the theory of computation the function notation of lambda calculus is used to explicitly express the basic notions of function abstraction and application In category theory and homological algebra networks of functions are described in terms of how they and their compositions commute with each other using commutative diagrams that extend and generalize the arrow notation for functions described above Other terms edit Term Distinction from function MapMapping None the terms are synonymous 9 A map can have any set as its codomain while in some contexts typically in older books the codomain of a function is specifically the set of real or complex numbers 10 Alternatively a map is associated with a special structure eg by explicitly specifying a structured codomain in its definition For example a linear map 11 Homomorphism A function between two structures of the same type that preserves the operations of the structure eg a group homomorphism 12 13 Morphism A generalisation of homomorphisms to any category even when the objects of the category are not sets for example a group defines a category with only one object which has the elements of the group as morphisms see Category mathematics Examples for this example and other similar ones 14 12 15 Map edit A function is often also called a map or a mapping but some authors make a distinction between the term map and function For example the term map is often reserved for a function with some sort of special structure eg maps of manifolds In particular map is often used in place of homomorphism for the sake of succinctness eg linear map or map from G to H instead of group homomorphism from G to H Some authors 16 reserve the word mapping for the case where the structure of the codomain belongs explicitly to the definition of the function Some authors such as Serge Lang 17 use function only to refer to maps for which the codomain is a subset of the real or complex numbers and use the term mapping for more general functions In the theory of dynamical systems a map denotes an evolution function used to create discrete dynamical systems See also PoincarÃ© map Whichever definition of map is used related terms like domain codomain injective continuous have the same meaning as for a function Specifying a function edit Given a function f displaystyle f by definition to each element x displaystyle x of the domain of the function f displaystyle f there is a unique element associated to it the value f x displaystyle fx of f displaystyle f at x displaystyle x There are several ways to specify or describe how x displaystyle x is related to f x displaystyle fx both explicitly and implicitly Sometimes a theorem or an axiom asserts the existence of a function having some properties without describing it more precisely Often the specification or description is referred to as the definition of the function f displaystyle f By listing function values edit On a finite set a function may be defined by listing the elements of the codomain that are associated to the elements of the domain Eg if A 1 2 3 displaystyle A123 then one can define a function f A R displaystyle fcolon Ato mathbb R by f 1 2 f 2 3 f 3 4 displaystyle f12f23f34 By a formula edit Functions are often defined by a formula that describes a combination of arithmetic operations and previously defined functions such a formula allows computing the value of the function from the value of any element of the domainFor example in the above example f displaystyle f can be defined by the formula f n n 1 displaystyle fnn1 for n 1 2 3 displaystyle nin 123 When a function is defined this way the determination of its domain is sometimes difficult If the formula that defines the function contains divisions the values of the variable for which a denominator is zero must be excluded from the domain thus for a complicated function the determination of the domain passes through the computation of the zeros of auxiliary functions Similarly if square roots occur in the definition of a function from R displaystyle mathbb R to R displaystyle mathbb R the domain is included in the set of the values of the variable for which the arguments of the square roots are nonnegative For example f x 1 x 2 displaystyle fxsqrt 1x2 defines a function f R R displaystyle fcolon mathbb R to mathbb R whose domain is R displaystyle mathbb R because 1 x 2 displaystyle 1x2 is always positive if x is a real number On the other hand f x 1 x 2 displaystyle fxsqrt 1x2 defines a function from the reals to the reals whose domain is reduced to the interval 1 1 In old texts such a domain was called the domain of definition of the function Functions are often classified by the nature of formulas that can that define them A quadratic function is a function that may be written f x a x 2 b x c displaystyle fxax2bxc where a b c are constants More generally a polynomial function is a function that can be defined by a formula involving only additions subtractions multiplications and exponentiation to nonnegative integers For example f x x 3 3 x 1 displaystyle fxx33x1 and f x x 1 x 3 1 2 x 2 1 displaystyle fxx1x312x21 A rational function is the same with divisions also allowed such as f x x 1 x 1 displaystyle fxfrac x1x1 and f x 1 x 1 3 x 2 x 1 displaystyle fxfrac 1x1frac 3xfrac 2x1 An algebraic function is the same with n th roots and roots of polynomials also allowed An elementary function note 5 is the same with logarithms and exponential functions allowed Inverse and implicit functions edit A function f X Y displaystyle fcolon Xto Y with domain X and codomain Y is bijective if for every y in Y there is one and only one element x in X such that y f x In this case the inverse function of f is the function f 1 Y X displaystyle f1colon Yto X that maps y Y displaystyle yin Y to the element x X displaystyle xin X such that y f x For example the natural logarithm is a bijective function from the positive real numbers to the real numbers It has these an inverse called the exponential function that maps the real numbers onto the positive numbers If a function f X Y displaystyle fcolon Xto Y is not bijective it may occur that one can select subsets E X displaystyle Esubseteq X and F Y displaystyle Fsubseteq Y such that the restriction of f to E is a bijection from E to F and has thus an inverse The inverse trigonometric functions are defined this way For example the cosine function induces by restriction a bijection from the interval 0 Ï onto the interval 1 1 and its inverse function called arccosine maps 1 1 onto 0 Ï The other inverse trigonometric functions are defined similarly More generally given a binary relation R between two sets X and Y let E be a subset of X such that for every x E displaystyle xin E there is some y Y displaystyle yin Y such that x R y If one has a criterion allowing selecting such an y for every x E displaystyle xin E this defines a function f E Y displaystyle fcolon Eto Y called an implicit function because it is implicitly defined by the relation R For example the equation of the unit circle x 2 y 2 1 displaystyle x2y21 defines a relation on real numbers If 1 x 1 there are two possible values of y one positive and one negative For x 1 these two values become both equal to 0 Otherwise there is no possible value of y This means that the equation defines two implicit functions with domain 1 1 and respective codomains 0 and 0 In this example the equation can be solved in y giving y 1 x 2 displaystyle ypm sqrt 1x2 but in more complicated examples this is impossible For example the relation y 5 x 1 0 displaystyle y5x10 defines y as an implicit function of x called the Bring radical which has R displaystyle mathbb R as domain and range The Bring radical cannot be expressed in terms of the four arithmetic operations and n th roots The implicit function theorem provides mild differentiability conditions for existence and uniqueness of an implicit function in the neighborhood of a point Using differential calculus edit Many functions can be defined as the antiderivative of another function This is the case of the natural logarithm which is the antiderivative of 1 x that is 0 for x 1 Another common example is the error function More generally many functions including most special functions can be defined as solutions of differential equations The simplest example is probably the exponential function which can be defined as the unique function that is equal to its derivative and takes the value 1 for x 0 Power series can be used to define functions on the domain in which they converge For example the exponential function is given by e x n 0 x n n displaystyle exsum n0infty xn over n However as the coefficients of a series are quite arbitrary a function that is the sum of a convergent series is generally defined otherwise and the sequence of the coefficients is the result of some computation based on another definition Then the power series can be used to enlarge the domain of the function Typically if a function for a real variable is the sum of its Taylor series in some interval this power series allows immediately enlarging the domain to a subset of the complex numbers the disc of convergence of the series Then analytic continuation allows enlarging further the domain for including almost the whole complex plane This process is the method that is generally used for defining the logarithm the exponential and the trigonometric functions of a complex number By recurrence edit Main article Recurrence relation Functions whose domain are the nonnegative integers known as sequences are often defined by recurrence relations The factorial function on the nonnegative integers n n displaystyle nmapsto n is a basic example as it can be defined by the recurrence relation n n n 1 for n 0 displaystyle nnn1quad textforquad n0 and the initial condition 0 1 displaystyle 01 Representing a function edit A graph is commonly used to give an intuitive picture of a function As an example of how a graph helps to understand a function it is easy to see from its graph whether a function is increasing or decreasing Some functions may also be represented by bar charts Graphs and plots edit Main article Graph of a function The function mapping each year to its US motor vehicle death count shown as a line chart The same function shown as a bar chart Given a function f X Y displaystyle fcolon Xto Y its graph is formally the set G x f x x X displaystyle Gxfxxin X In the frequent case where X and Y are subsets of the real numbers or may be identified with such subsets eg intervals an element x y G displaystyle xyin G may be identified with a point having coordinates x y in a 2dimensional coordinate system eg the Cartesian plane Parts of this may create a plot that represents parts of the function The use of plots is so ubiquitous that they too are called the graph of the function Graphic representations of functions are also possible in other coordinate systems For example the graph of the square function x x 2 displaystyle xmapsto x2 consisting of all points with coordinates x x 2 displaystyle xx2 for x R displaystyle xin mathbb R yields when depicted in Cartesian coordinates the well known parabola If the same quadratic function x x 2 displaystyle xmapsto x2 with the same formal graph consisting of pairs of numbers is plotted instead in polar coordinates r Î¸ x x 2 displaystyle rtheta xx2 the plot obtained is Fermats spiral Tables edit Main article Mathematical table A function can be represented as a table of values If the domain of a function is finite then the function can be completely specified in this way For example the multiplication function f 1 5 2 R displaystyle fcolon 1ldots 52to mathbb R defined as f x y x y displaystyle fxyxy can be represented by the familiar multiplication table y x 1 2 3 4 5 1 1 2 3 4 5 2 2 4 6 8 10 3 3 6 9 12 15 4 4 8 12 16 20 5 5 10 15 20 25 On the other hand if a functions domain is continuous a table can give the values of the function at specific values of the domain If an intermediate value is needed interpolation can be used to estimate the value of the function For example a portion of a table for the sine function might be given as follows with values rounded to 6 decimal places x sin x 1289 0960557 1290 0960835 1291 0961112 1292 0961387 1293 0961662 Before the advent of handheld calculators and personal computers such tables were often compiled and published for functions such as logarithms and trigonometric functions Bar chart edit Main article Bar chart Bar charts are often used for representing functions whose domain is a finite set the natural numbers or the integers In this case an element x of the domain is represented by an interval of the x axis and the corresponding value of the function f x is represented by a rectangle whose base is the interval corresponding to x and whose height is f x possibly negative in which case the bar extends below the x axis General properties edit This section describes general properties of functions that are independent of specific properties of the domain and the codomain Standard functions edit There are a number of standard functions that occur frequently For every set X there is a unique function called the empty function from the empty set to X The existence of the empty function is a convention that is needed for the coherency of the theory and for avoiding exceptions concerning the empty set in many statements For every set X and every singleton set s there is a unique function from X to s which maps every element of X to s This is a surjection see below unless X is the empty set Given a function f X Y displaystyle fcolon Xto Y the canonical surjection of f onto its image f X f x x X displaystyle fXfxmid xin X is the function from X to f X that maps x to f x For every subset A of a set X the inclusion map of A into X is the injective see below function that maps every element of A to itself The identity function on a set X often denoted by id X is the inclusion of X into itself Function composition edit Main article Function composition Given two functions f X Y displaystyle fcolon Xto Y and g Y Z displaystyle gcolon Yto Z such that the domain of g is the codomain of f their composition is the function g f X Z displaystyle gcirc fcolon Xrightarrow Z defined by g f x g f x displaystyle gcirc fxgfx That is the value of g f displaystyle gcirc f is obtained by first applying f to x to obtain y f x and then applying g to the result y to obtain g y g f x In the notation the function that is applied first is always written on the right The composition g f displaystyle gcirc f is an operation on functions that is defined only if the codomain of the first function is the domain of the second one Even when both g f displaystyle gcirc f and f g displaystyle fcirc g satisfy these conditions the composition is not necessarily commutative that is the functions g f displaystyle gcirc f and f g displaystyle fcirc g need not be equal but may deliver different values for the same argument For example let f x x 2 and g x x 1 then g f x x 2 1 displaystyle gfxx21 and f g x x 1 2 displaystyle fgxx12 agree just for x 0 displaystyle x0 The function composition is associative in the sense that if one of h g f displaystyle hcirc gcirc f and h g f displaystyle hcirc gcirc f is defined then the other is also defined and they are equal Thus one writes h g f h g f h g f displaystyle hcirc gcirc fhcirc gcirc fhcirc gcirc f The identity functions id X displaystyle operatorname id X and id Y displaystyle operatorname id Y are respectively a right identity and a left identity for functions from X to Y That is if f is a function with domain X and codomain Y one has f id X id Y f f displaystyle fcirc operatorname id Xoperatorname id Ycirc ff A composite function g f x can be visualized as the combination of two machines A simple example of a function composition Another composition In this example g f c Image and preimage edit Main article Image mathematics Let f X Y displaystyle fcolon Xto Y The image by f of an element x of the domain X is f x If A is any subset of X then the image of A by f denoted f A is the subset of the codomain Y consisting of all images of elements of A that is f A f x x A displaystyle fAfxmid xin A The image of f is the image of the whole domain that is f X It is also called the range of f although the term may also refer to the codomain 18 On the other hand the inverse image or preimage by f of a subset B of the codomain Y is the subset of the domain X consisting of all elements of X whose images belong to B It is denoted by f 1 B displaystyle f1B That is f 1 B x X f x B displaystyle f1Bxin Xmid fxin B For example the preimage of 4 9 under the square function is the set 3223 By definition of a function the image of an element x of the domain is always a single element of the codomain However the preimage of a single element y denoted f 1 x displaystyle f1x may be empty or contain any number of elements For example if f is the function from the integers to themselves that maps every integer to 0 then f 1 0 Z displaystyle f10mathbb Z If f X Y displaystyle fcolon Xto Y is a function A and B are subsets of X and C and D are subsets of Y then one has the following properties A B f A f B displaystyle Asubseteq BLongrightarrow fAsubseteq fB C D f 1 C f 1 D displaystyle Csubseteq DLongrightarrow f1Csubseteq f1D A f 1 f A displaystyle Asubseteq f1fA C f f 1 C displaystyle Csupseteq ff1C f f 1 f A f A displaystyle ff1fAfA f 1 f f 1 C f 1 C displaystyle f1ff1Cf1C The preimage by f of an element y of the codomain is sometimes called in some contexts the fiber of y under f If a function f has an inverse see below this inverse is denoted f 1 displaystyle f1 In this case f 1 C displaystyle f1C may denote either the image by f 1 displaystyle f1 or the preimage by f of C This is not a problem as these sets are equal The notation f A displaystyle fA and f 1 C displaystyle f1C may be ambiguous in the case of sets that contain some subsets as elements such as x x displaystyle xx In this case some care may be needed for example by using square brackets f A f 1 C displaystyle fAf1C for images and preimages of subsets and ordinary parentheses for images and preimages of elements Injective surjective and bijective functions edit This section does not cite

X is not the empty set and if as usual ZermeloFraenkel set theory is assumed then f is injective if and only if there exists a function g Y X displaystyle gcolon Yto X such that g f id X displaystyle gcirc foperatorname id X that is if f has a left inverse If f is injective for defining g one chooses an element x 0 displaystyle x0 in X which exists as X is supposed to be nonempty note 6 and one defines g by g y x displaystyle gyx if y f x displaystyle yfx and g y x 0 displaystyle gyx0 if y f X displaystyle ynot in fX The function f is surjective or onto or is a surjection if the range equals the codomain that is if f X Y In other words the preimage f 1 y displaystyle f1y of every y Y displaystyle yin Y is nonempty If as usual the axiom of choice is assumed then f is surjective if and only if there exists a function g Y X displaystyle gcolon Yto X such that f g id Y displaystyle fcirc goperatorname id Y that is if f has a right inverse The axiom of choice is needed because if f is surjective one defines g by g y x displaystyle gyx where x displaystyle x is an arbitrarily chosen element of f 1 y displaystyle f1y The function f is bijective or is bijection or a onetoone correspondence if it is both injective and surjective That is f is bijective if for any y Y displaystyle yin Y the preimage f 1 y displaystyle f1y contains exactly one element The function f is bijective if and only if it admits an inverse function that is a function g Y X displaystyle gcolon Yto X such that g f id X displaystyle gcirc foperatorname id X and f g id Y displaystyle fcirc goperatorname id Y Contrarily to the case of surjections this does not require the axiom of choice Every function f X Y displaystyle fcolon Xto Y may be factorized as the composition i s of a surjection followed by an injection where s is the canonical surjection of X onto f X and i is the canonical injection of f X into Y This is the canonical factorization of f Onetoone and onto are terms that were more common in the older English language literature injective surjective and bijective were originally coined as French words in the second quarter of the 20th century by the Bourbaki group and imported into English As a word of caution a onetoone function is one that is injective while a onetoone correspondence refers to a bijective function Also the statement f maps X onto Y differs from f maps X into B in that the former implies that f is surjective while the latter makes no assertion about the nature of f the mapping In a complicated reasoning the one letter difference can easily be missed Due to the confusing nature of this older terminology these terms have declined in popularity relative to the Bourbakian terms which have also the advantage to be more symmetrical Restriction and extension edit Main article Restriction mathematics If f X Y displaystyle fcolon Xto Y is a function and S is a subset of X then the restriction of f displaystyle f to S denoted f S displaystyle fS is the function from S to Y defined by f S x f x displaystyle fSxfx for all x in S Restrictions can be used to define partial inverse functions if there is a subset S of the domain of a function f displaystyle f such that f S displaystyle fS is injective then the canonical surjection of f S displaystyle fS onto its image f S S f S displaystyle fSSfS is a bijection and thus has an inverse function from f S displaystyle fS to S One application is the definition of inverse trigonometric functions For example the cosine function is injective when restricted to the interval 0 Ï The image of this restriction is the interval 1 1 and thus the restriction has an inverse function from 1 1 to 0 Ï which is called arccosine and is denoted arccos Function restriction may also be used for gluing functions together Let X i I U i displaystyle textstyle Xbigcup iin IUi be the decomposition of X as a union of subsets and suppose that a function f i U i Y displaystyle ficolon Uito Y is defined on each U i displaystyle Ui such that for each pair i j displaystyle ij of indices the restrictions of f i displaystyle fi and f j displaystyle fj to U i U j displaystyle Uicap Uj are equal Then this defines a unique function f X Y displaystyle fcolon Xto Y such that f U i f i displaystyle fUifi for all i This is the way that functions on manifolds are defined An extension of a function f is a function g such that f is a restriction of g A typical use of this concept is the process of analytic continuation that allows extending functions whose domain is a small part of the complex plane to functions whose domain is almost the whole complex plane Here is another classical example of a function extension that is encountered when studying homographies of the real line A homography is a function h x a x b c x d displaystyle hxfrac axbcxd such that ad bc 0 Its domain is the set of all real numbers different from d c displaystyle dc and its image is the set of all real numbers different from a c displaystyle ac If one extends the real line to the projectively extended real line by including one may extend h to a bijection from the extended real line to itself by setting h a c displaystyle hinfty ac and h d c displaystyle hdcinfty Multivariate function edit A binary operation is a typical example of a bivariate function which assigns to each pair x y displaystyle xy the result x y displaystyle xcirc y A multivariate function or function of several variables is a function that depends on several arguments Such functions are commonly encountered For example the position of a car on a road is a function of the time and its speed More formally a function of n variables is a function whose domain is a set of n tuples For example multiplication of integers is a function of two variables or bivariate function whose domain is the set of all pairs 2tuples of integers and whose codomain is the set of integers The same is true for every binary operation More generally every mathematical operation is defined as a multivariate function The Cartesian product X 1 X n displaystyle X1times cdots times Xn of n sets X 1 X n displaystyle X1ldots Xn is the set of all n tuples x 1 x n displaystyle x1ldots xn such that x i X i displaystyle xiin Xi for every i with 1 i n displaystyle 1leq ileq n Therefore a function of n variables is a function f U Y displaystyle fcolon Uto Y where the domain U has the form U X 1 X n displaystyle Usubseteq X1times cdots times Xn When using function notation one usually omits the parentheses surrounding tuples writing f x 1 x 2 displaystyle fx1x2 instead of f x 1 x 2 displaystyle fx1x2 In the case where all the X i displaystyle Xi are equal to the set R displaystyle mathbb R of real numbers one has a function of several real variables If the X i displaystyle Xi are equal to the set C displaystyle mathbb C of complex numbers one has a function of several complex variables It is common to also consider functions whose codomain is a product of sets For example Euclidean division maps every pair a b of integers with b 0 to a pair of integers called the quotient and the remainder Euclidean division Z Z 0 Z Z a b quotient a b remainder a b displaystyle beginalignedtextEuclidean divisioncolon quad mathbb Z times mathbb Z setminus 0to mathbb Z times mathbb Z abmapsto operatorname quotient aboperatorname remainder abendaligned The codomain may also be a vector space In this case one talks of a vectorvalued function If the domain is contained in a Euclidean space or more generally a manifold a vectorvalued function is often called a vector field In calculus edit The idea of function starting in the 17th century was fundamental to the new infinitesimal calculus see History of the function concept At that time only realvalued functions of a real variable were considered and all functions were assumed to be smooth But the definition was soon extended to functions of several variables and to functions of a complex variable In the second half of the 19th century the mathematically rigorous definition of a function was introduced and functions with arbitrary domains and codomains were defined Functions are now used throughout all areas of mathematics In introductory calculus when the word function is used without qualification it means a realvalued function of a single real variable The more general definition of a function is usually introduced to second or third year college students with STEM majors and in their senior year they are introduced to calculus in a larger more rigorous setting in courses such as real analysis and complex analysis Real function edit See also Real analysis Graph of a linear function Graph of a polynomial function here a quadratic function Graph of two trigonometric functions sine and cosine A real function is a realvalued function of a real variable that is a function whose codomain is the field of real numbers and whose domain is a set of real numbers that contains an interval In this section these functions are simply called functions The functions that are most commonly considered in mathematics and its applications have some regularity that is they are continuous differentiable and even analytic This regularity insures that these functions can be visualized by their graphs In this section all functions are differentiable in some interval Functions enjoy pointwise operations that is if f and g are functions their sum difference and product are functions defined by f g x f x g x f g x f x g x f g x f x g x displaystyle beginalignedfgxfxgxfgxfxgxfcdot gxfxcdot gxendaligned The domains of the resulting functions are the intersection of the domains of f and g The quotient of two functions is defined similarly by f g x f x g x displaystyle frac fgxfrac fxgx but the domain of the resulting function is obtained by removing the zeros of g from the intersection of the domains of f and g The polynomial functions are defined by polynomials and their domain is the whole set of real numbers They include constant functions linear functions and quadratic functions Rational functions are quotients of two polynomial functions and their domain is the real numbers with a finite number of them removed to avoid division by zero The simplest rational function is the function x 1 x displaystyle xmapsto frac 1x whose graph is a hyperbola and whose domain is the whole real line except for 0 The derivative of a real differentiable function is a real function An antiderivative of a continuous real function is a real function that is differentiable in any open interval in which the original function is continuous For example the function x 1 x displaystyle xmapsto frac 1x is continuous and even differentiable on the positive real numbers Thus one antiderivative which takes the value zero for x 1 is a differentiable function called the natural logarithm A real function f is monotonic in an interval if the sign of f x f y x y displaystyle frac fxfyxy does not depend of the choice of x and y in the interval If the function is differentiable in the interval it is monotonic if the sign of the derivative is constant in the interval If a real function f is monotonic in an interval I it has an inverse function which is a real function with domain f I and image I This is how inverse trigonometric functions are defined in terms of trigonometric functions where the trigonometric functions are monotonic Another example the natural logarithm is monotonic on the positive real numbers and its image is the whole real line therefore it has an inverse function that is a bijection between the real numbers and the positive real numbers This inverse is the exponential function Many other real functions are defined either by the implicit function theorem the inverse function is a particular instance or as solutions of differential equations For example the sine and the cosine functions are the solutions of the linear differential equation y y 0 displaystyle yy0 such that sin 0 0 cos 0 1 sin x x 0 1 cos x x 0 0 displaystyle sin 00quad cos 01quad frac partial sin xpartial x01quad frac partial cos xpartial x00 Vectorvalued function edit Main articles Vectorvalued function and Vector field When the elements of the codomain of a function are vectors the function is said to be a vectorvalued function These functions are particularly useful in applications for example modeling physical properties For example the function that associates to each point of a fluid its velocity vector is a vectorvalued function Some vectorvalued functions are defined on a subset of R n displaystyle mathbb R n or other spaces that share geometric or topological properties of R n displaystyle mathbb R n such as manifolds These vectorvalued functions are given the name vector fields Function space edit Main articles Function space and Functional analysis In mathematical analysis and more specifically in functional analysis a function space is a set of scalarvalued or vectorvalued functions which share a specific property and form a topological vector space For example the real smooth functions with a compact support that is they are zero outside some compact set form a function space that is at the basis of the theory of distributions Function spaces play a fundamental role in advanced mathematical analysis by allowing the use of their algebraic and topological properties for studying properties of functions For example all theorems of existence and uniqueness of solutions of ordinary or partial differential equations result of the study of function spaces Multivalued functions edit Main article Multivalued function Together the two square roots of all nonnegative real numbers form a single smooth curve Several methods for specifying functions of real or complex variables start from a local definition of the function at a point or on a neighbourhood of a point and then extend by continuity the function to a much larger domain Frequently for a starting point x 0 displaystyle x0 there are several possible starting values for the function For example in defining the square root as the inverse function of the square function for any positive real number x 0 displaystyle x0 there are two choices for the value of the square root one of which is positive and denoted x 0 displaystyle sqrt x0 and another which is negative and denoted x 0 displaystyle sqrt x0 These choices define two continuous functions both having the nonnegative real numbers as a domain and having either the nonnegative or the nonpositive real numbers as images When looking at the graphs of these functions one can see that together they form a single smooth curve It is therefore often useful to consider these two square root functions as a single function that has two values for positive x one value for 0 and no value for negative x In the preceding example one choice the positive square root is more natural than the other This is not the case in general For example let consider the implicit function that maps y to a root x of x 3 3 x y 0 displaystyle x33xy0 see the figure on the right For y 0 one may choose either 0 3 or 3 displaystyle 0sqrt 3text or sqrt 3 for x By the implicit function theorem each choice defines a function for the first one the maximal domain is the interval 2 2 and the image is 1 1 for the second one the domain is 2 and the image is 1 for the last one the domain is 2 and the image is 1 As the three graphs together form a smooth curve and there is no reason for preferring one choice these three functions are often considered as a single multivalued function of y that has three values for 2 y 2 and only one value for y 2 and y 2 Usefulness of the concept of multivalued functions is clearer when considering complex functions typically analytic functions The domain to which a complex function may be extended by analytic continuation generally consists of almost the whole complex plane However when extending the domain through two different paths one often gets different values For example when extending the domain of the square root function along a path of complex numbers with positive imaginary parts one gets i for the square root of 1 while when extending through complex numbers with negative imaginary parts one gets i There are generally two ways of solving the problem One may define a function that is not continuous along some curve called a branch cut Such a function is called the principal value of the function The other way is to consider that one has a multivalued function which is analytic everywhere except for isolated singularities but whose value may jump if one follows a closed loop around a singularity This jump is called the monodromy In the foundations of mathematics and set theory edit The definition of a function that is given in this article requires the concept of set since the domain and the codomain of a function must be a set This is not a problem in usual mathematics as it is generally not difficult to consider only functions whose domain and codomain are sets which are well defined even if the domain is not explicitly defined However it is sometimes useful to consider more general functions For example the singleton set may be considered as a function x x displaystyle xmapsto x Its domain would include all sets and therefore would not be a set In usual mathematics one avoids this kind of problem by specifying a domain which means that one has many singleton functions However when establishing foundations of mathematics one may have to use functions whose domain codomain or both are not specified and some authors often logicians give precise definition for these weakly specified functions 19 These generalized functions may be critical in the development of a formalization of the foundations of mathematics For example Von NeumannBernaysGÃ¶del set theory is an extension of the set theory in which the collection of all sets is a class This theory includes the replacement axiom which may be stated as If X is a set and F is a function then F X is a set In computer science edit Main articles Function programming and Lambda calculus In computer programming a function is in general a piece of a computer program which implements the abstract concept of function That is it is a program unit that produces an output for each input However in many programming languages every subroutine is called a function even when there is no output and when the functionality consists simply of modifying some data in the computer memory Functional programming is the programming paradigm consisting of building programs by using only subroutines that behave like mathematical functions For example ifthenelse is a function that takes three functions as arguments and depending on the result of the first function true or false returns the result of either the second or the third function An important advantage of functional programming is that it makes easier program proofs as being based on a well founded theory the lambda calculus see below Except for computerlanguage terminology function has the usual mathematical meaning in computer science In this area a property of major interest is the computability of a function For giving a precise meaning to this concept and to the related concept of algorithm several models of computation have been introduced the old ones being general recursive functions lambda calculus and Turing machine The fundamental theorem of computability theory is that these three models of computation define the same set of computable functions and that all the other models of computation that have ever been proposed define the same set of computable functions or a smaller one The ChurchTuring thesis is the claim that every philosophically acceptable definition of a computable function defines also the same functions General recursive functions are partial functions from integers to integers that can be defined from constant functions successor and projection functions via the operators composition primitive recursion and minimization Although defined only for functions from integers to integers they can model any computable function as a consequence of the following properties a computation is the manipulation of finite sequences of symbols digits of numbers formulas every sequence of symbols may be coded as a sequence of bits a bit sequence can be interpreted as the binary representation of an integer Lambda calculus is a theory that defines computable functions without using set theory and is the theoretical background of functional programming It consists of terms that are either variables function definitions Î» terms or applications of functions to terms Terms are manipulated through some rules the Î± equivalence the Î² reduction and the Î· conversion which are the axioms of the theory and may be interpreted as rules of computation In its original form lambda calculus does not include the concepts of domain and codomain of a function Roughly speaking they have been introduced in the theory under the name of type in typed lambda calculus Most kinds of typed lambda calculi can define fewer functions than untyped lambda calculus See

transformation correspondence and operator are often used synonymously Halmos 1970 p30 This definition of graph refers to a set of pairs of objects Graphs in the sense of diagrams are most applicable to functions from the real numbers to themselves All functions can be described by sets of pairs but it may not be practical to construct a diagram for functions between other sets such as sets of matrices The sets X Y are parts of data defining a function ie a function is a set of ordered pairs x y displaystyle xy with x X y Y displaystyle xin Xyin Y together with the sets X Y such that for each x X displaystyle xin X there is a unique y Y displaystyle yin Y with x y displaystyle xy in the set This follows from the axiom of extensionality which says two sets are the same if and only if they have the same members Some authors drop codomain from a definition of a function and in that definition the notion of equality has to be handled with care see for example When do two functions
