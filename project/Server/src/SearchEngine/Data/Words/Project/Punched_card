Punched card Overpunch redirects here For the COBOL code see Signed overpunch A punched card or punch card is a piece of stiff paper approximately equivalent to 100 card stock that can be used to contain digital data represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions 1 Digital data can be used for data processing applications or in earlier examples used to directly control automated machinery Punched cards were widely used through much of the 20th century in the data processing industry where specialized and increasingly complex unit record machines organized into semiautomatic data processing systems used punched cards for data input output and storage 2 3 Many early digital computers used punched cards often prepared using keypunch machines as the primary medium for input of both computer programs and data While punched cards are now obsolete as a storage medium as of 2012 some voting machines still use punched cards to record votes 4 A punched card

in 1725 The design was improved by his assistant JeanBaptiste Falcon and by Jacques Vaucanson 5 Although these improvements controlled the patterns woven they still required an assistant to operate the mechanism In 1804 Joseph Marie Jacquard demonstrated a mechanism to automate loom operation A number of punched cards were linked into a chain of any length Each card held the instructions for shedding raising and lowering the warp and selecting the shuttle for a single pass It is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware 6 Carpet loom with Jacquard apparatus by Carl Engel around 1860 Chain feed is on the left Semyon Korsakov was reputedly the first to propose punched cards in informatics for information store and search Korsakov announced his new method and machines in September 1832 7 Charles Babbage proposed the use of Number Cards pierced with certain holes and standing opposite levers connected with a set of figure wheels advanced they push in those levers opposite to which there are no holes on the cards and thus transfer that number together with its sign in his description of the Calculating Engines Store 8 In 1881 Jules Carpentier developed a method of recording and playing back performances on a harmonium using punched cards The system was called the Mélographe Répétiteur and writes down ordinary music played on the keyboard dans la langage de Jacquard 9 that is as holes punched in a series of cards By 1887 Carpentier had separated the mechanism into the Melograph which recorded the players key presses and the Melotrope which played the music 10 11 At the end of the 1800s Herman Hollerith invented the recording of data on a medium that could then be read by a machine After some initial trials with paper tape he settled on punched cards developing punched card data processing technology for the 1890 US census 12 His tabulating machines read and summarized data stored on punched cards and they began use for government and commercial data processing Initially these electromechanical machines only counted holes but by the 1920s they had units for carrying out basic arithmetic operations 13 Hollerith founded the Tabulating Machine Company 1896 which was one of four companies that were amalgamated via stock acquisition to form a fifth company ComputingTabulatingRecording Company CTR 1911 later renamed International Business Machines Corporation IBM 1924 Other companies entering the punched card business included The Tabulator Limited 1902 later renamed the British Tabulating Machine Company Deutsche HollerithMaschinen Gesellschaft mbH Dehomag 1911 Powers Accounting Machine Company 1911 later acquired by Remington Rand Remington Rand 1927 and HW Egli Bull 1931 14 These companies and others manufactured and marketed a variety of punched cards and unit record machines for creating sorting and tabulating punched cards even after the development of electronic computers in the 1950s Both IBM and Remington Rand tied punched card purchases to machine leases a violation of the 1914 Clayton Antitrust Act In 1932 the US government took both to court on this issue Remington Rand settled quickly IBM viewed its business as providing a service and that the cards were part of the machine IBM fought all the way to the Supreme Court and lost in 1936 the court ruling that IBM could only set card specifications 15 16 By 1937 IBM had 32 presses at work in Endicott NY printing cutting and stacking five to 10 million punched cards every day 17 Punched cards were even used as legal documents such as US Government checks 18 and savings bonds 19 During World War II punched card equipment was used by the Allies in some of their efforts to decrypt Axis communications See for example Central Bureau in Australia At Bletchley Park in England 2000000 punched cards were used each week for storing decrypted German messages 20 Punched card technology developed into a powerful tool for business dataprocessing By 1950 punched cards had become ubiquitous in industry and government Do not fold spindle or mutilate a generalized version of the warning that appeared on some punched cards generally on those distributed as paper documents to be later returned for further machine processing such as checks and utility bills became a motto for the post World War II era 21 22 In 1955 IBM signed a consent decree requiring amongst other things that IBM would by 1962 have no more than onehalf of the punched card manufacturing capacity in the United States Tom Watson Jrs decision to sign this decree where IBM saw the punched card provisions as the most significant point completed the transfer of power to him from Thomas Watson Sr 23 The UNITYPER introduced magnetic tape for data entry in the 1950s During the 1960s the punched card was gradually replaced as the primary means for data storage by magnetic tape as better more capable computers became available Mohawk Data Sciences introduced a magnetic tape encoder in 1965 a system marketed as a keypunch replacement which was somewhat successful Punched cards were still commonly used for entering both data and computer programs until the mid1980s when the combination of lower cost magnetic disk storage and affordable interactive terminals on less expensive minicomputers made punched cards obsolete for these roles as well 24 However their influence lives on through many standard conventions and file formats The terminals that replaced the punched cards the IBM 3270 for example displayed 80 columns of text in text mode for compatibility with existing software Some programs still operate on the convention of 80 text columns although fewer and fewer do as newer systems employ graphical user interfaces with variablewidth type fonts Nomenclature edit A deck of punched cards comprising a computer program The terms punched card punch card and punchcard were all commonly used as were IBM card and Hollerith card after Herman Hollerith 25 IBM used IBM card or later punched card at first mention in its documentation and thereafter simply card or cards 26 27 Specific formats were often indicated by the number of character positions available eg 80column card A sequence of cards that is input to or output from some step in an applications processing is called a card deck or simply deck The rectangular round or oval bits of paper punched out were called chad chads or chips in IBM usage Sequential card columns allocated for a specific use such as names addresses multidigit numbers etc are known as a field The first card of a group of cards containing fixed or indicative information for that group is known as a master card Cards that are not master cards are detail cards Card formats edit The Hollerith punched cards used for the US 1890 census were blank 28 Following that cards commonly had printing such that the row and column position of a hole could be easily seen Printing could include having fields named and marked by vertical lines logos and more 29 General purpose layouts see for example the IBM 5081 below were also available For applications requiring master cards to be separated from following detail cards the respective cards had different upper corner diagonal cuts and thus could be separated by a sorter 30 Other cards typically had one upper corner diagonal cut so that cards not oriented correctly or cards with different corner cuts could be identified Holleriths early punched card formats edit Hollerith card as shown in the Railroad Gazette in 1895 with 12 rows and 24 columns 31 Herman Hollerith was awarded a series of patents 32 in 1889 for electromechanical tabulating machines These patents described both paper tape and rectangular cards as possible recording media The card shown in US Patent 395781 of January 8 was printed with a template and had hole positions arranged close to the edges so they could be reached by a railroad conductor s ticket punch with the center reserved for written descriptions Hollerith was originally inspired by railroad tickets that let the conductor encode a rough description of the passenger I was traveling in the West and I had a ticket with what I think was called a punch photographthe conductorpunched out a description of the individual as light hair dark eyes large nose etc So you see I only made a punch photograph of each person 33 When use of the ticket punch proved tiring and error prone Hollerith developed the pantograph keyboard punch It featured an enlarged diagram of the card indicating the positions of the holes to be punched A printed reading board could be placed under a card that was to be read manually 34 Hollerith envisioned a number of card sizes In an article he wrote describing his proposed system for tabulating the 1890 US Census Hollerith suggested a card 3inches by 5 inches of Manila stock would be sufficient to answer all ordinary purposes 35 The cards used in the 1890 census had round holes 12 rows and 24 columns A reading board for these cards can be seen at the Columbia University Computing History site 36 At some point 3 1 4 by 7 3 8 inches 826 by 1873mm became the standard card size These are the dimensions of the then current paper currency of 18621923 37 Holleriths original system used an adhoc coding system for each application with groups of holes assigned specific meanings eg sex or marital status His tabulating machine had up to 40 counters each with a dial divided into 100 divisions with two indicator hands one which stepped one unit with each counting pulse the other which advanced one unit every time the other dial made a complete revolution This arrangement allowed a count up to 9999 During a given tabulating run counters were assigned specific holes or using relay logic combination of holes 35 Later designs led to a card with ten rows each row assigned a digit value 0 through 9 and 45 columns 38 This card provided for fields to record multidigit numbers that tabulators could sum instead of their simply counting cards Holleriths 45 column punched cards are illustrated in Comrie s The application of the Hollerith Tabulating Machine to Browns Tables of the Moon 39 40 IBM 80column punched card format and character codes edit Punched card from a Fortran program Z1 Y W1 plus sorting information in the last 8 columns By the late 1920s customers wanted to store more data on each punched card Thomas J Watson Sr IBMs head asked two of his top inventors Clair D Lake and J Royden Pierce to independently develop ways to increase data capacity without increasing the size of the punched card Pierce wanted to keep round holes and 45 columns but allow each column to store more data Lake suggested rectangular holes which could be spaced more tightly allowing 80 columns per punched card thereby nearly doubling the capacity of the older format 41 Watson picked the latter solution introduced as The IBM Computer Card in part because it was compatible with existing tabulator designs and in part because it could be protected by patents and give the company a distinctive advantage 42 This IBM card format introduced in 1928 43 has rectangular holes 80 columns and 12 rows Card size is exactly 7 3 8 by 3 1 4 inches 187325mm 8255mm The cards are made of smooth stock 0007 inches 180μm thick There are about 143 cards to the inch 56cm In 1964 IBM changed from square to round corners 44 They come typically in boxes of 2000 cards 45 or as continuous form cards Continuous form cards could be both prenumbered and prepunched for document control checks for example 46 Initially designed to record responses to Yesno questions support for numeric alphabetic and special characters was added through the use of columns and zones The top three positions of a column are called zone punching positions 12 top 11 and 0 0 may be either a zone punch or a digit punch 47 For decimal data the lower ten positions are called digit punching positions 0 top through 9 47 An arithmetic sign can be specified for a decimal field by overpunching the fields rightmost column with a zone punch 12 for plus 11 for minus CR For Pound sterling predecimalization currency a penny column represents the values zero through eleven 10 top 11 then 0 through 9 as above An arithmetic sign can be punched in the adjacent shilling column 48 Zone punches had other uses in processing such as indicating a master card 49 An 80column punched card of the type most widely used in the 20th century

zones were also called the X and Y zones respectively In 1931 IBM began introducing uppercase letters and special characters PowersSamas had developed the first commercial alphabetic punched card representation in 1921 51 52 53 The 26 letters have two punches zone 12110 digit 19 The languages of Germany Sweden Denmark Norway Spain Portugal and Finland require up to three additional letters their punching is not shown here 54 8890 Most special characters have two or three punches zone 12110 or none digit 27 8 a few special characters were exceptions is 12 only is 11 only and is 0 1 The Space character has no punches 54 38 The information represented in a column by a combination of zones 12 11 0 and digits 09 is dependent on the use of that column For example the combination 121 is the letter A in an alphabetic column a plus signed digit 1 in a signed numeric column or an unsigned digit 1 in a column where the 12 has some other use The introduction of EBCDIC in 1964 defined columns with as many as six punches zones 1211089 digit 17 IBM and other manufacturers used many different 80column card character encodings 55 56 A 1969 American National Standard defined the punches for 128 characters and was named the Hollerith Punched Card Code often referred to simply as Hollerith Card Code honoring Hollerith 54 7 Binary punched card For some computer applications binary formats were used where each hole represented a single binary digit or bit every column or row is treated as a simple bit field and every combination of holes is permitted For example on the IBM 701 57 and IBM 704 58 card data was read into memory in row binary format For each of the twelve rows of the card 72 of the 80 columns would be read into two 36bit words a control panel was used to select the 72 columns to be read Software would translate this data into the desired form One convention was to use columns 1 through 72 for data and columns 73 through 80 to sequentially number the cards as shown in the picture above of a punched card for FORTRAN Such numbered cards could be sorted by machine so that if a deck was dropped the sorting machine could be used to arrange it back in order This convention continued to be used in FORTRAN even in later systems where the data in all 80 columns could be read Invalid lace cards such as this pose mechanical problems for card readers As a prank punched cards could be made where every possible punch position had a hole Such lace cards lacked structural strength and would frequently buckle and jam inside the machine 59 The IBM 80column punched card format dominated the industry becoming known as just IBM cards even though other companies made cards and equipment to process them 60 A 5081 card from a nonIBM manufacturer One of the most common punched card formats is the IBM 5081 card format a general purpose layout with no field divisions This format has digits printed on it corresponding to the punch positions of the digits in each of the 80 columns Other punched card vendors manufactured cards with this same layout and number IBM Stub card or Short card formats edit The 80column card could be scored on either end creating a stub that could be torn off leaving a stub card or short card 61 A common length for stub cards was 51 columns Stub cards were used in applications requiring tags labels or carbon copies 46 IBM 40column PortAPunch card format edit IBM PortAPunch FORTRAN PortAPunch card Compiler directive SQUEEZE removed the alternating blank columns from the input IBM 96 column punched card According to the IBM Archive IBMs Supplies Division introduced the PortAPunch in 1958 as a fast accurate means of manually punching holes in specially scored IBM punched cards Designed to fit in the pocket PortAPunch made it possible to create punched card documents anywhere The product was intended for onthespot recording operationssuch as physical inventories job tickets and statistical surveysbecause it eliminated the need for preliminary writing or typing of source documents 62 IBM 96column punched card format edit In the late 1960s IBM introduced a new smaller roundhole 96column card format along with the IBM System3 computer These cards have tiny 1mm circular holes smaller than those in paper tape Data is stored in 6bit BCD with three rows of 32 characters each or 8bit EBCDIC In this format each column of the top tiers are combined with two punch rows from the bottom tier to form an 8bit byte and the middle tier is combined with two more punch rows so that each card contains 64 bytes of 8bitperbyte binary coded data 63 PowersRemington Rand UNIVAC 90column punched card format edit A blank Remington Rand UNIVAC format card Card courtesy of MIT Museum A punched Remington Rand card with an IBM card for comparison The PowersRemington Rand card format was initially the same as Holleriths 45 columns and round holes In 1930 Remington Rand leapfrogged IBMs 80 column format from 1928 by coding two characters in each of the 45 columns producing what is now commonly called the 90column card 64 There are two sets of six rows across each card The rows in each set are labeled 0 12 34 56 78 and 9 The even numbers in a pair are formed by combining that punch with a 9 punch Alphabetic and special characters use 3 or more punches 65 66 PowersSamas punched card formats edit The PowersSamas card formats began with 45 columns and round holes Later 36 40 and 65 column cards were provided A 130 column card was also available formed by dividing the card into two rows each row with 65 columns and each character space with 5 punch positions A 21 column card was comparable to the IBM Stub card 67 Mark sense card format edit HP Educational Basic optical markreader card Mark sense electrographic cards developed by Reynold B Johnson at IBM 68 have printed ovals that could be marked with a special electrographic pencil Cards would typically be punched with some initial information such as the name and location of an inventory item Information to be added such as quantity of the item on hand would be marked in the ovals Card punches with an option to detect mark sense cards could then punch the corresponding information into the card Aperture card format edit Aperture card Aperture cards have a cutout hole on the right side of the punched card A piece of 35mm microfilm containing a microform image is mounted in the hole Aperture cards are used for engineering drawings from all engineering disciplines Information about the drawing for example the drawing number is typically punched and printed on the remainder of the card IBM punched card manufacturing edit IBMs Fred M Carroll 69 developed a series of rotary presses that were used to produce punched cards including a 1921 model that operated at 460 cards per minute cpm In 1936 he introduced a completely different press that operated at 850 cpm 17 70 Carrolls highspeed press containing a printing cylinder revolutionized the companys manufacturing of punched cards 71 It is estimated that between 1930 and 1950 the Carroll press accounted for as much as 25 percent of the companys profits 23 Institutions such as universities often had their general purpose cards printed with a logo A wide variety of forms and documents were printed on punched cards including checks Such printing did not interfere with the operation of the machinery A punched card printing plate Discarded printing plates from these card presses each printing plate the size of an IBM card and formed into a cylinder often found use as desk penpencil holders and even today are collectible IBM artifacts every card layout 72 had its own printing plate Pricing edit Punched cards were not inexpensive a 1996 Lookback found prices as high as 42 for a box of 2000 punched cards 73 Cultural impact edit A 75 US Savings Bond Series EE issued as a punched card Eight of the holes record the bond serial number Cartons of punched cards stored in a United States National Archives Records Service facility in 1959 Each carton could hold 2000 cards While punched cards have not been widely used for a generation the impact was so great for most of the 20th century that they still appear from time to time in popular culture For example Artist and architect Maya Lin in 2004 designed a public art installation at Ohio University titled Input that looks like a punched card from the air 74 Tucker Hall at the University of Missouri Columbia features architecture that is reportedly influenced by punched cards It is said that the spacing and pattern of the windows on the building will spell out MIZ beat kU on a punched card making reference to the University and states rivalry with neighboring state Kansas 75 At the University of Wisconsin Madison the exterior windows of the Engineering Research Building 76 were modeled after a punched card layout during its construction in 1966 At the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks a portion of the exterior of Gamble Hall College of Business and Public Administration has a series of lightcolored bricks that resembles a punched card spelling out University of North Dakota 77 In the Simpsons episode Much Apu About Nothing Apu showed Bart his PhD thesis the worlds first computer tictactoe game stored in a box full of punched cards In the Futurama episode Mothers Day as several robots are seen shouting Hey hey Hey ho 1100110 in protest one of them burns a punch card in a manner reminiscent of draftcard burning In another episode Put Your Head on My Shoulders Bender offers a dating service He hands characters punch cards so they can put in what they want before throwing them in his chest cabinet and calculating the match for the person Bender is shown folding bending and mutilating the punched card accentuating the fact that he is making up the calculations In the 196465 Free Speech Movement punched cards became a metaphor symbol of the systemfirst the registration system and then bureaucratic systems more generally a symbol of alienation Punched cards were the symbol of information machines and so they became the symbolic point of attack Punched cards used for class registration were first and foremost a symbol of uniformity A student might feel he is one of out of 27500 IBM cards The president of the Undergraduate Association criticized the University as a machine IBM pattern of education Robert Blaumer explicated the symbolism he referred to the sense of impersonality symbolized by the IBM technologyStevenLubar 78 A legacy of the 80 column punched card format is that a display of 80 characters per row was a common choice in the design of characterbased terminals citation needed As of September 2014 some character interface defaults such as the command prompt windows width in Microsoft Windows remain set at 80 columns and some file formats such as FITS still use 80character card images In Arthur C Clarkes early short story Rescue Party the alien explorers find a wonderful battery of almost human Hollerith analyzers and the five thousand million punched cards holding all that could be recorded on each man woman and child on the planet 79 Writing in 1946 Clarke like almost all scifi authors had not then foreseen the development and eventual ubiquity of the computer The Man Whose Name Wouldnt Fit a book by Theodore Tyler 80 Popular magazines featured instructions for a Christmas wreath made from punched cards 81 Do Not Fold Spindle or Mutilate edit A common example of the requests often printed on punched cards which were to be individually handled especially those intended for the public to use and return is Do Not Fold Spindle or Mutilate in the UK Do not bend spike fold or mutilate 82 Coined by Charles A Phillips 83 it became a motto 84 for the post World War II era even though many people had no idea what spindle meant and was widely mocked and satirized Some 1960s students at Berkeley wore buttons saying Do not fold spindle or mutilate I am a student 85 The motto was also used for a 1970 book by Doris Miles Disney 86 with a plot based around an early computer dating service and a
