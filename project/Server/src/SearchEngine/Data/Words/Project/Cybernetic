Cybernetics For other uses see Cybernetics disambiguation Principle diagram of a cybernetic system with a feedback loop Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary 1 approach for exploring regulatory systems their structures constraints and possibilities Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics in 1948 as the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine 2 In other words it is the scientific study of how humans animals and machines control and communicate with each other Cybernetics is applicable when a system being analyzed incorporates a closed signaling looporiginally referred to as a circular causal relationshipthat is where action by the system generates some change in its environment and that change is reflected in the system in some manner feedback that triggers a system change Cybernetics is relevant to for example mechanical physical biological cognitive and social systems The essential goal of the broad field of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems that have goals and that participate in circular causal chains that move from action to sensing to comparison with desired goal and again to action Its focus is how anything digital mechanical or biological processes information reacts to information and changes or can be changed to better accomplish the first two tasks 3 Cybernetics includes the study of feedback black boxes and derived concepts such as communication and control in living organisms machines and organizations including selforganization Concepts studied by cyberneticists include but are not limited to learning cognition adaptation social control emergence convergence communication efficiency efficacy and connectivity In cybernetics these concepts otherwise already objects of study in other disciplines such as biology and engineering are abstracted from the context of the specific organism or device The word cybernetics comes from Greek κυβερνητική kybernētikḗ meaning governance ie all that are pertinent to κυβερνάω kybernáō the latter meaning to steer navigate or govern hence κυβέρνησις kybérnēsis meaning government is the government while κυβερνήτης kybernḗtēs is the governor or helmperson of the ship Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems electrical network theory mechanical engineering logic modeling evolutionary biology neuroscience anthropology and psychology in the 1940s often attributed to the Macy Conferences During the second half of the 20th century cybernetics evolved in ways that distinguish firstorder cybernetics about observed systems from secondorder cybernetics about observing systems 4 More recently there is talk about a thirdorder cybernetics doing in ways that embraces first and secondorder 5 Studies in cybernetics provide a means for examining the design and function of any system including social systems such as business management and organizational learning including for the purpose of making them more efficient and effective Fields of study which have influenced or been influenced by cybernetics include game theory system theory a mathematical counterpart to cybernetics perceptual control theory sociology psychology especially neuropsychology behavioral psychology cognitive psychology philosophy architecture and organizational theory 6 System dynamics originated with applications of electrical engineering control theory to other kinds of simulation models especially business systems by Jay Forrester at MIT in

Couffignal 8 9 The art of effective organization Stafford Beer The art and science of manipulating defensible metaphors with relevance to constructivist epistemology The author later extended the definition to include information flows in all media from stars to brains Gordon Pask The art of creating equilibrium in a world of constraints and possibilities Ernst von Glasersfeld The science and art of understanding Humberto Maturana The ability to cure all temporary truth of eternal triteness Herbert Brun Other notable definitions include The science and art of the understanding of

networks Roy Ascott The study of systems and processes that interact with themselves and produce themselves from themselves Louis Kauffman President of the American Society for Cybernetics 10 Etymology edit Simple feedback model AB 0 for negative feedback The term cybernetics stems from κυβερνήτης cybernḗtēs steersman governor pilot or rudder As with the ancient Greek pilot independence of thought is important in cybernetics 11 French physicist and mathematician AndréMarie Ampère first coined the word cybernetique in his 1834 essay Essai sur la philosophie des sciences to describe the science of civil government 12 The term was borrowed by Norbert Wiener in his book Cybernetics to define the study of control and communication in the animal and the machine 2 History edit Roots of cybernetic theory edit The word cybernetics was first used in the context of the study of selfgovernance by Plato in Alcibiades to signify the governance of people 13 The word cybernétique was also used in 1834 by the physicist AndréMarie Ampère 17751836 to denote the sciences of government in his classification system of human knowledge James Watt The first artificial automatic regulatory system was a water clock invented by the mechanician Ktesibios based on a tank which poured water into a reservoir before using it to run the mechanism it used a coneshaped float to monitor the level of the water in its reservoir and adjust the rate of flow of the water accordingly to maintain a constant level of water in the reservoir This was the first artificial truly automatic selfregulatory device that required no outside intervention between the feedback and the controls of the mechanism Although they considered this part of engineering the use of the term cybernetics is much posterior Ktesibios and others such as Heron and Su Song are considered to be some of the first to study cybernetic principles The study of teleological mechanisms from the Greek τέλος or télos for end goal or purpose in machines with corrective feedback dates from as far back as the late 18th century when James Watt s steam engine was equipped with a governor 17751800 a centrifugal feedback valve for controlling the speed of the engine Alfred Russel Wallace identified this as the principle of evolution in his famous 1858 paper 14 In 1868 James Clerk Maxwell published a theoretical article on governors one of the first to discuss and refine the principles of selfregulating devices Jakob von Uexküll applied the feedback mechanism via his model of functional cycle Funktionskreis in order to explain animal behaviour and the origins of meaning in general Early 20th century edit Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems electrical network theory mechanical engineering logic modeling evolutionary biology and neuroscience in the 1940s the ideas are also related to the biological work of Ludwig von Bertalanffy in General Systems Theory Electronic control systems originated with the 1927 work of Bell Telephone Laboratories engineer Harold S Black on using negative feedback to control amplifiers Early applications of negative feedback in electronic circuits included the control of gun mounts and radar antenna during World War II The founder of System Dynamics Jay Forrester worked with Gordon S Brown during WWII as a graduate student at the Servomechanisms Laboratory at MIT to develop electronic control systems for the US Navy Forrester later applied these ideas to social organizations such as corporations and cities and became an original organizer of the MIT School of Industrial Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management W Edwards Deming the Total Quality Management guru for whom Japan named its top postWWII industrial prize was an intern at Bell Telephone Labs in 1927 and may have been influenced by network theory Deming made Understanding Systems one of the four pillars of what he described as Profound Knowledge in his book The New Economics Numerous papers spearheaded the coalescing of the field In 1935 Russian physiologist P K Anokhin published a book in which the concept of feedback back afferentation was studied The study and mathematical modelling of regulatory processes became a continuing research effort and two key articles were published in 1943 Behavior Purpose and Teleology by Arturo Rosenblueth Norbert Wiener and Julian Bigelow and the paper A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts In 1936 Ștefan Odobleja published Phonoscopy and the clinical semiotics In 1937 he participated in the IX International Congress of Military Medicine with Demonstration de phonoscopie in the paper he disseminated a prospectus announcing his future work Psychologie consonantiste the most important of his writings where he lays the theoretical foundations of generalized cybernetics The book published in Paris by Librairie Maloine vol I in 1938 and vol II in 1939 contains almost 900 pages and includes 300 figures in the text The author wrote at the time that this book is a table of contents an index or a dictionary of psychology for a great Treatise of Psychology that should contain 2030 volumes Due to the beginning of World War II the publication went unnoticed the first Romanian edition of this work did not appear until 1982 Norbert Wiener Cybernetics as a discipline was firmly established by Norbert Wiener McCulloch Arturo Rosenblueth and others such as W Ross Ashby mathematician Alan Turing and W Grey Walter one of the first to build autonomous robots as an aid to the study of animal behaviour In the spring of 1947 Wiener was invited to a congress on harmonic analysis held in Nancy France was an important geographical locus of early cybernetics together with the US and UK the event was organized by the Bourbaki a French scientific society and mathematician Szolem Mandelbrojt 18991983 uncle of the worldfamous mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot During this stay in France Wiener received the offer to write a manuscript on the unifying character of this part of applied mathematics which is found in the study of Brownian motion and in telecommunication engineering The following summer back in the United States Wiener decided to introduce the neologism cybernetics coined to denote the study of teleological mechanisms into his scientific theory it was popularized through his book Cybernetics Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine MIT PressJohn Wiley and Sons NY 1948 2 In the UK this became the focus for the Ratio Club John von Neumann In the early 1940s John von Neumann contributed a unique and unusual addition to the world of cybernetics von Neumann cellular automata and their logical follow up the von Neumann Universal Constructor The result of these deceptively simple thoughtexperiments was the concept of self replication which cybernetics adopted as a core concept The concept that the same properties of genetic reproduction applied to social memes living cells and even computer viruses is further proof of the somewhat surprising universality of cybernetic study In 1950 Wiener popularized the social implications of cybernetics drawing analogies between automatic systems such as a regulated steam engine and human institutions in his bestselling The Human Use of Human Beings Cybernetics and Society HoughtonMifflin Cybernetics in the Soviet Union was initially considered a pseudoscience and ideological weapon of imperialist reactionaries Soviet Philosophical Dictionary 1954 and later criticised as a narrow form of cybernetics 15 In the mid to late 1950s Viktor Glushkov and others salvaged the reputation of the field Soviet cybernetics incorporated much of what became known as computer science in the West 16 While not the only instance of a research organization focused on cybernetics the Biological Computer Lab at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign under the direction of Heinz von Foerster was a major center of cybernetic research for almost 20 years beginning in 1958 Split from artificial intelligence edit Artificial intelligence AI was founded as a distinct discipline at the Dartmouth workshop After some uneasy coexistence AI gained funding and prominence Consequently cybernetic sciences such as the study of artificial neural networks were downplayed the discipline shifted into the world of social sciences and therapy 17 Prominent cyberneticians during this period include Gregory Bateson and Aksel Berg New cybernetics edit In the 1970s new cyberneticians emerged in multiple fields but especially in biology The ideas of Maturana Varela and Atlan according to JeanPierre Dupuy 1986 realized that the cybernetic metaphors of the program upon which molecular biology had been based rendered a conception of the autonomy of the living being impossible Consequently these thinkers were led to invent a new cybernetics one more suited to the organizations which mankind discovers in nature organizations he has not himself invented 18 However during the 1980s the question of whether the features of this new cybernetics could be applied to social forms of organization remained open to debate 18 In political science Project Cybersyn attempted to introduce a cybernetically controlled economy during the early 1970s 19 In the 1980s according to HarriesJones 1988 unlike its predecessor the new cybernetics concerns itself with the interaction of autonomous political actors and subgroups and the practical and reflexive consciousness of the subjects who produce and reproduce the structure of a political community A dominant consideration is that of recursiveness or selfreference of political action both with regards to the expression of political consciousness and with the ways in which systems build upon themselves 20 One characteristic of the emerging new cybernetics considered in that time by Felix Geyer and Hans van der Zouwen according to Bailey 1994 21 was that it views information as constructed and reconstructed by an individual interacting with the environment This provides an epistemological foundation of science by viewing it as observerdependent Another characteristic of the new cybernetics is its contribution towards bridging the micromacro gap That is it links the individual with the society 21 Another characteristic noted was the transition from classical cybernetics to the new cybernetics that involves a transition from classical problems to new problems These shifts in thinking involve among others a a change from emphasis on the system being steered to the system doing the steering and the factor which guides the steering decisions and b new emphasis on communication between several systems which are trying to steer each other 21 Recent endeavors into the true focus of cybernetics systems of control and emergent behavior by such related fields as game theory the analysis of group interaction systems of feedback in evolution and metamaterials the study of materials with properties beyond the Newtonian properties of their constituent atoms have led to a revived interest in this increasingly relevant field 3 Cybernetics and economic systems edit Part of a series on Economic systems By

planned economy was explored by economist Oskar Lange cyberneticist Viktor Glushkov and others Soviet cyberneticists during the 1960s By the time information technology was developed enough to enable feasible economic planning based on computers the Soviet Union and eastern bloc countries began moving away from planning 22 and eventually collapsed More recent proposals for socialism involve New Socialism outlined by the computer scientists Paul Cockshott and Allin Cottrell where computers determine and manage the flows and allocation of resources among socially owned enterprises 23 On the other hand Friedrich Hayek also mentions cybernetics as a discipline that could help economists understand the selforganizing or selfgenerating systems called markets 24 Being a complex phenomena 25 the best way to examine the market functioning is by using the feedback mechanism explained by cybernetic theorists That way economists could make pattern predictions 26 Therefore the market for Hayek is a communication system an efficient mechanism for digesting dispersed information 27 The economist and a cyberneticist are like garderners who are providing the appropriate environment 27 Hayeks definition of information is idiosyncratic and precedes the information theory used in cybernetics and the natural sciences Finally Hayek also considers Adam Smith s idea of the invisible hand as an anticipation of the operation of the feedback mechanism in cybernetics 28 In the same book Law Legislation and Liberty Hayek mentions along with cybernetics that economists should rely on the scientific findings of Ludwig von Bertalanffy general systems theory along with information and communication theory and semiotics 28 Subdivisions of the field edit Cybernetics is sometimes used as a generic term which serves as an umbrella for many systemsrelated scientific fields Basic cybernetics edit ASIMO uses sensors and sophisticated algorithms to avoid obstacles and navigate stairs Cybernetics studies systems of control as a concept attempting to discover the basic principles underlying such things as Artificial intelligence Computer vision Control systems Conversation theory Emergence Interactions of actors theory Learning organization Robotics Secondorder cybernetics Selforganization in cybernetics In biology edit Cybernetics in biology is the study of cybernetic systems present in biological organisms primarily focusing on how animals adapt to their environment and how information in the form of genes is passed from generation to generation There is also a secondary focus on combining artificial systems with biological systems 29 A notable application to the biology world would be that in 1955 the physicist George Gamow published a prescient article in Scientific American called Information transfer in the living cell and cybernetics gave biologists Jacques Monod and François Jacob a language for formulating their early theory of gene regulatory networks in the 1960s 30 Autopoiesis Biocybernetics Bioengineering Bionics Ecology Heterostasis Homeostasis Medical cybernetics Neuroscience Synthetic biology Systems biology Practopoiesis In computer science

mobs and riots as well as how communities develop rules such as etiquette by consensus without formal discussion citation needed Affect Control Theory explains role behavior emotions and labeling theory in terms of homeostatic maintenance of sentiments associated with cultural categories The most comprehensive attempt ever made in the social sciences to increase cybernetics in a generalized theory of society was made by Talcott Parsons In this way cybernetics establishes the basic hierarchy in Parsons AGIL paradigm which is the ordering systemdimension of his action theory These and other cybernetic models in sociology are reviewed in a book edited by McClelland and Fararo 31 Affect control theory Memetics citation needed Sociocybernetics Niklas Luhmann In art edit Nicolas Schöffer s CYSP I 1956 was perhaps the first artwork to explicitly employ cybernetic principles CYSP is an acronym that joins the first two letters of the words CYbernetic and SPatiodynamic 32 The prominent and influential Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition was held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968 curated by Jasia Reichardt including Schöffers CYSP I and Gordon Pasks Colloquy of Mobiles installation Pasks reflections on Colloquy connected it to his earlier Musicolour installation and to what he termed aesthetically potent environments a concept that connected this artistic work to his concerns with teaching and learning 33 The artist Roy Ascott elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision Cybernetica Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics Namur Volume IX No4 1966 Volume X No1 1967 and in The Cybernetic Stance My Process and Purpose Leonardo Vol 1 No 2 1968 Art historian Edward A Shanken has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including Cybernetics and Art Cultural Convergence in the 1960s 34 35 and From Cybernetics to Telematics The Art Pedagogy and Theory of Roy Ascott 2003 36 which traces the trajectory of Ascotts work from cybernetic art to telematic art art using computer networking as its medium a precursor to netart Telematic art Interactive art Systems art In architecture and design edit Cybernetics was an influence on thinking in architecture and design in the decades after the Second World War Ashby and Pask were drawn on by design theorists such as Horst Rittel 37 Christopher Alexander 38 and Bruce Archer 39 Pask was a consultant to Nicholas Negropontes Architecture Machine Group forerunner of the MIT Media Lab and collaborated with architect Cedric Price and theatre director Joan Littlewood on the influential Fun Palace project during the 1960s 40 Pasks 1950s Musicolour installation was the inspiration for John and Julia Frazers work on Prices Generator project 41 There has been a resurgence of interest in cybernetics and systems thinking amongst designers in recent decades in relation to developments in technology and increasingly complex design challenges 42 Figures such as Klaus Krippendorff Paul Pangaro and Ranulph Glanville have made significant contributions to both cybernetics and design research The connections between the two fields have come to be understood less in terms of application and more as reflections of each other 43 In Earth system science edit Geocybernetics aims to study and control the complex coevolution of ecosphere and anthroposphere 44 for example for dealing with planetary problems such as anthropogenic global warming 45 Geocybernetics applies a dynamical systems perspective to Earth system analysis It provides a theoretical framework for studying the implications of following different sustainability paradigms on coevolutionary trajectories of the planetary socioecological system to reveal attractors in this system their stability resilience and reachability Concepts such as tipping points in the climate system planetary boundaries the safe operating space for humanity and proposals for manipulating Earth system dynamics on a global scale such as geoengineering have been framed in the language of geocybernetic Earth system analysis In sport edit A model of cybernetics
