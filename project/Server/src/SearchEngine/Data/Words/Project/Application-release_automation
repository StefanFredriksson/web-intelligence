ITIL Glossaries Artificial intelligence Computer science Electrical and electronics engineering v t e Applicationrelease automation ARA refers to the process of packaging and deploying an application or update of an application from development across various environments and ultimately to production 1 ARA solutions must combine the capabilities of deployment automation environment management and modeling and release coordination 2 Contents 1 Relationship with DevOps 2 Relationship with Deployment 3 ARA Solutions 4 References Relationship with DevOps edit ARA tools help cultivate DevOps best practices by providing a combination of automation environment modeling and workflowmanagement capabilities These practices help teams deliver software rapidly reliably and responsibly ARA tools achieve a key DevOps goal of implementing continuous delivery with a large quantity of releases quickly 3 Relationship with Deployment edit ARA is more than just softwaredeployment automation it deploys applications using structured releaseautomation techniques that allow for an increase in visibility for the whole team 4 It combines workload automation and releasemanagement tools as they relate to release packages as well as movement through different environments within the DevOps pipeline 5 ARA tools help regulate deployments how environments are created and deployed and how and when releases are deployed 6 ARA Solutions edit Gartner and Forrester have published lists of ARA tools in their ARA Magic Quadrant and Wave reports respectively 7 8 All ARA solutions must include capabilities in automation environment modeling and release coordination Additionally the solution must provide this functionality without reliance on other tools 9 Solution Released by BuildMaster
