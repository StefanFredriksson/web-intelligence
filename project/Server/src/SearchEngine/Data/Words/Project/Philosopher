philosophos meaning lover of wisdom The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras 6th century BC 1 In the classical sense a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life focusing on resolving existential questions about the human condition and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors 2 Typically these particular brands of philosophy are Hellenistic ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense doesnt know when to stop asking questions and reexamines the old ways of thought 3 In a modern sense a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy such as aesthetics ethics epistemology logic metaphysics social theory and political philosophy A philosopher may also be one who worked in the humanities or other sciences which have since split from philosophy proper over the centuries such as the arts history economics sociology psychology linguistics anthropology theology and politics 4 Contents 1 History 11 Ancient Greece and Rome 111

philosophy in general see History of philosophy Ancient Greece and Rome edit The separation of philosophy and science from theology began in Greece during the 6th century BC 5 Thales an astronomer and mathematician was considered by Aristotle to be the first philosopher of the Greek tradition 6 While Pythagoras coined the word the first known elaboration on the topic was conducted by Plato In his Symposium he concludes that Love is that which lacks the object it seeks Therefore the philosopher is one who seeks wisdom if he attains wisdom he would be a sage Therefore the philosopher in antiquity was one who lives in the constant pursuit of wisdom and living in accordance to that wisdom 7 Disagreements arose as to what living philosophically entailed These disagreements gave rise to different Hellenistic schools of philosophy In consequence the ancient philosopher thought in a tradition 8 As the ancient world became schism by philosophical debate the competition lay in living in a manner that would transform his whole way of living in the world 9 Among the last of these philosophers was Marcus Aurelius who is widely regarded as a philosopher in the modern sense but personally refused to call himself by such a title since he had a duty to live as an emperor 10 Transition edit According to the Classicist Pierre Hadot the modern conception of a philosopher and philosophy developed predominately through three changes The first is the natural inclination of the philosophical mind Philosophy is a tempting discipline which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory 11 The second is the historical change through the Medieval era With the rise of Christianity the philosophical way of life was adopted by its theology Thus philosophy was divided between a way of life and the conceptual logical physical and metaphysical materials to justify that way of life Philosophy was then the servant to theology 12 The third is the sociological need with the development of the university The modern university requires professionals to teach Maintaining itself requires teaching future professionals to replace the current faculty Therefore the discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life 12 Medieval era edit In the fourth century the word philosopher began to designate a man or woman who led a monastic life Gregory of Nyssa for example describes how his sister Macrina persuaded their mother to forsake the distractions of material life for a life of philosophy 13 Later during the Middle Ages persons who engaged with alchemy was called a philosopher thus the Philosophers Stone 14 Early modern era edit Generally speaking university philosophy is mere fencing in front of a mirror In the last analysis its goal is to give students opinions which are to the liking of the minister who hands out the Chairs As a result this statefinanced philosophy makes a joke of philosophy And yet if there is one thing desirable in this world it is to see a ray of light fall onto the darkness of our lives shedding some kind of light on the mysterious enigma of our existence Arthur Schopenhauer Many philosophers still emerged from the Classical tradition as saw their philosophy as a way of life Among the most notable are René Descartes Baruch Spinoza Nicolas Malebranche and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz With the rise of the university the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent Many of the esteemed philosophers of the eighteenth century and onward have attended taught and developed their works in university Early examples include Immanuel Kant Johann Gottlieb Fichte Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel 15 After these individuals the Classical conception had all but died with the exceptions of Arthur Schopenhauer Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche The last considerable figure in philosophy to not have followed a strict and orthodox academic regime was Ludwig Wittgenstein 16 Modern academia edit In the modern era those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system as part of the wider professionalisation process of the discipline in the 20th century 17 According to a 1993 study by the National Research Council as reported by the American Philosophical Association 771 of the 7900 holders of a PhD in philosophy who responded were employed in educational institutions academia Outside
