Description logic family of formal knowledge representation Description logics DL are a family of formal knowledge representation languages Many DLs are more expressive than propositional logic but less expressive than firstorder logic In contrast to the latter the core reasoning problems for DLs are usually decidable and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems There are general spatial temporal spatiotemporal and fuzzy descriptions logics and each description logic features a different balance between expressive power and reasoning complexity by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors 1 DLs are used in artificial intelligence to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain known as terminological knowledge It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for ontologies and the Semantic Web the Web Ontology Language OWL and its profile is based on DLs The most notable application of DLs and OWL is in biomedical informatics where DL assists in the codification of biomedical knowledge Contents 1 Introduction 2 Nomenclature 21 Terminology compared to FOL and OWL 22 Naming

statement relating roles andor concepts 2 This is a key difference from the frames paradigm where a frame specification declares and completely defines a class 2 Nomenclature edit Terminology compared to FOL and OWL edit The description logic community uses different terminology than the firstorder logic FOL community for operationally equivalent notions some examples are given below The Web Ontology Language OWL uses again a different terminology also given in the table below Synonyms FOL OWL DL constant individual individual unary predicate class concept binary predicate property role Naming convention edit There are many varieties of description logics and there is an informal naming convention roughly describing the operators allowed The expressivity is encoded in the label for a logic starting with one of the following basic logics A L displaystyle mathcal AL Attributive language This is the base language which allows Atomic negation negation of concept names that do not appear on the lefthand side of axioms Concept intersection Universal restrictions Limited existential quantification F L displaystyle mathcal FL Frame based description language 3 allows Concept intersection Universal restrictions Limited existential quantification Role restriction E L displaystyle mathcal EL Existential language allows Concept intersection Existential restrictions of full existential quantification Followed by any of the following extensions F displaystyle mathcal F Functional properties a special case of uniqueness quantification E displaystyle mathcal E Full existential qualification existential restrictions that have fillers other than displaystyle top U displaystyle mathcal U Concept union C displaystyle mathcal C Complex concept negation H displaystyle

Nominals Enumerated classes of object value restrictions owloneOf owlhasValue I displaystyle mathcal I Inverse properties N displaystyle mathcal N Cardinality restrictions owlcardinality owlmaxCardinality a special case of counting quantification Q displaystyle mathcal Q Qualified cardinality restrictions available in OWL 2 cardinality restrictions that have fillers other than displaystyle top D displaystyle mathcal D Use of datatype properties data values or data types Exceptions edit Some canonical DLs that do not exactly fit this convention are S displaystyle mathcal S An abbreviation for A L C displaystyle mathcal ALC with transitive roles F L displaystyle mathcal FL A sublanguage of F L displaystyle mathcal FL which is obtained by disallowing role restriction This is equivalent to A L displaystyle mathcal AL without atomic negation F L o displaystyle mathcal FLo A sublanguage of F L displaystyle mathcal FL which is obtained by disallowing limited existential quantification E L displaystyle mathcal EL Alias for E L R O displaystyle mathcal ELRO 4 Examples edit As an example A L C displaystyle mathcal ALC is a centrally important description logic from which comparisons with other varieties can be made A L C displaystyle mathcal ALC is simply A L displaystyle mathcal AL with complement of any concept allowed not just atomic concepts A L C displaystyle mathcal ALC is used instead of the equivalent A L U E displaystyle mathcal ALUE A further example the description logic S H I Q displaystyle mathcal SHIQ is the logic A L C displaystyle mathcal ALC plus extended cardinality restrictions and transitive and inverse roles The naming conventions arent purely systematic so that the logic A L C O I N displaystyle mathcal ALCOIN might be referred to as A L C N I O displaystyle mathcal ALCNIO and abbreviations are made where possible The Protégé ontology editor supports S H O I N D displaystyle mathcal SHOINmathcal D Three major biomedical informatics terminology bases SNOMED CT GALEN and GO are expressible in E L displaystyle mathcal EL with additional role properties OWL 2 provides the expressiveness of S R O I Q D displaystyle mathcal SROIQmathcal D OWLDL is based on S H O I N D displaystyle mathcal SHOINmathcal D and for OWLLite it is S H I F D displaystyle mathcal SHIFmathcal D History edit Description logic was given its current name in the 1980s Previous to this it was called chronologically terminological systems and concept languages Knowledge representation edit Frames and semantic networks lack formal logicbased semantics 5 DL was first introduced into knowledge representation KR systems to overcome this deficiency 5 The first DLbased KR system was KLONE by Ronald J Brachman and Schmolze 1985 During the 80s other DLbased systems using structural subsumption algorithms 5 were developed including KRYPTON 1983 LOOM 1987 BACK 1988 KREP 1991 and CLASSIC 1991 This approach featured DL with limited expressiveness but relatively efficient polynomial time reasoning 5 In the early 90s the introduction of a new tableau based algorithm paradigm allowed efficient reasoning on more expressive DL 5 DLbased systems using these algorithms such as KRIS 1991 show acceptable reasoning performance on typical inference problems even though the worst case complexity is no longer polynomial 5 From the mid 90s reasoners were created with good practical performance on very expressive DL with high worst case complexity 5 Examples from this period include FaCT 6 RACER 2001 CEL 2005 and KAON 2 2005 DL reasoners such as FaCT FaCT 6 RACER DLP and Pellet 7 implement the method of analytic tableaux KAON2 is implemented by algorithms which reduce a SHIQD knowledge base to a disjunctive datalog program Semantic web edit The DARPA Agent Markup Language DAML and Ontology Inference Layer OIL ontology languages for the Semantic Web can be viewed as syntactic variants of DL 8 In particular the formal semantics and reasoning in OIL use the S H I Q displaystyle mathcal SHIQ DL 9 The DAMLOIL DL was developed as a submission to 10 and formed the starting point ofthe World Wide Web Consortium W3C Web Ontology Working Group 11 In 2004 the Web Ontology Working Group completed its work by issuing the OWL 12 recommendation The design of OWL is based on the S H displaystyle mathcal SH family of DL 13 with OWL DL and OWL Lite based on S H O I N D displaystyle mathcal SHOINmathcal D and S H I F D displaystyle mathcal SHIFmathcal D respectively 13 The W3C OWL Working Group began work in 2007 on a refinement of and extension to OWL 14 In 2009 this was completed by the issuance of the OWL2 recommendation 15 OWL2 is based on the description logic S R O I Q D displaystyle mathcal SROIQmathcal D 16 Practical experience demonstrated that OWL DL lacked several key features necessary to model complex domains 2 Modeling edit In DL a distinction is drawn between the socalled TBox terminological box and the ABox assertional box In general the TBox contains sentences describing concept hierarchies ie relations between concepts while the ABox contains ground sentences stating where in the hierarchy individuals belong ie relations between individuals and concepts For example the statement Every employee is a person 1 belongs in the TBox while the statement Bob is an employee 2 belongs in the ABox Note that the TBoxABox distinction is not significant in the same sense that the two kinds of sentences are not treated differently in firstorder logic which subsumes most DL When translated into firstorder logic a subsumption axiom like 1 is simply a conditional restriction to unary predicates concepts with only variables appearing in it Clearly a sentence of this form is not privileged or special over sentences in which only constants grounded values appear like 2 So why was the distinction introduced The primary reason is that the separation can be useful when describing and formulating decisionprocedures for various DL For example a reasoner might process the TBox and ABox separately in part because certain key inference problems are tied to one but not the other one classification is related to the TBox instance checking to the ABox Another example is that the complexity of the TBox can greatly affect the performance of a given decisionprocedure for a certain DL independently of the ABox Thus it is useful to have a way to talk about that specific part of the knowledge base The secondary reason is that the distinction can make sense from the knowledge base modelers perspective It is plausible to distinguish between our conception of termsconcepts in the world class axioms in the TBox and particular manifestations of those termsconcepts instance assertions in the ABox In the above example when the hierarchy within a company is the same in every branch but the assignment to employees is different in every department because there are other people working there it makes sense to reuse the TBox for different branches that do not use the same ABox There are two features of description logic that are not shared by most other data description formalisms DL does not make the unique name assumption UNA or the closedworld assumption CWA Not having UNA means that two concepts with different names may be allowed by some inference to be shown to be equivalent Not having CWA or rather having the open world assumption OWA means that lack of knowledge of a fact does not immediately imply knowledge of the negation of a fact Formal description edit Like firstorder logic FOL a syntax defines which collections of symbols are legal expressions in a description logic and semantics determine meaning Unlike FOL a DL may have several well known syntactic variants 8 Syntax edit The syntax of a member of the description logic family is characterized by its recursive definition in which the constructors that can be used to form concept terms are stated Some constructors are related to logical constructors in firstorder logic FOL such as intersection or conjunction of concepts union or disjunction of concepts negation or complement of concepts universal restriction and existential restriction Other constructors have no corresponding construction in FOL including restrictions on roles for example inverse transitivity and functionality Notation edit Let C and D be concepts a and b be individuals and R be a role If a is Rrelated to b then b is called an Rsuccessor of a Conventional Notation Symbol Description Example Read displaystyle top is a special concept with every individual as an instance displaystyle top top displaystyle bot empty concept displaystyle bot bottom displaystyle sqcap intersection or conjunction of concepts C D displaystyle Csqcap D C and D displaystyle sqcup union or disjunction of concepts C D displaystyle Csqcup D C or D displaystyle neg negation or complement of concepts C

displaystyle dot Concept definition C D displaystyle Cdot D C is defined to be equal to D displaystyle Concept assertion a C displaystyle aC a is a C displaystyle Role assertion a b R displaystyle abR a is Rrelated to b The description logic ALC edit The prototypical DL Attributive Concept Language with Complements A L C displaystyle mathcal ALC was introduced by Manfred SchmidtSchauß and Gert Smolka in 1991 and is the basis of many more expressive DLs 5 The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al 5 Let N C displaystyle NC N R displaystyle NR and N O displaystyle NO be respectively sets of concept names also known as atomic concepts role names and individual names also known as individuals nominals or objects Then the ordered triple N C displaystyle NC N R displaystyle NR N O displaystyle NO is the signature Concepts edit The set of A L C displaystyle mathcal ALC concepts is the smallest set such that The following are concepts displaystyle top top is a concept displaystyle bot bottom is a concept Every A N C displaystyle Ain NC all atomic concepts are concepts If C displaystyle C and D displaystyle D are concepts and R N R displaystyle Rin NR then the following are concepts C D displaystyle Csqcap D the intersection of two concepts is a concept C D displaystyle Csqcup D the union of two concepts is a concept C displaystyle neg C the complement of a concept is a concept R C displaystyle forall RC the universal restriction of a concept by a role is a concept R C displaystyle exists RC the existential restriction of a concept by a role is a concept Terminological axioms edit A general concept inclusion GCI has the form C D displaystyle Csqsubseteq D where C displaystyle C and D displaystyle D are concepts Write C D displaystyle Cequiv D when C D displaystyle Csqsubseteq D and D C displaystyle Dsqsubseteq C A TBox is any finite set of GCIs Assertional axioms edit A concept assertion is a statement of the form a C displaystyle aC where a N O displaystyle ain NO and C is a concept A role assertion is a statement of the form a b R displaystyle abR where a b N O displaystyle abin NO and R is a role An ABox is a finite set of assertional axioms Knowledge base edit A knowledge base KB is an ordered pair T A displaystyle mathcal Tmathcal A for TBox T displaystyle mathcal T and ABox A displaystyle mathcal A Semantics edit The semantics of description logics are defined by interpreting concepts as sets of individuals and roles as sets of ordered pairs of individuals Those individuals are typically assumed from a given domain The semantics of nonatomic concepts and roles is then defined in terms of atomic concepts and roles This is done by using a recursive definition similar to the syntax The description logic ALC edit The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al 5 A terminological interpretation I Δ I I displaystyle mathcal IDelta mathcal Icdot mathcal I over a signature N C N R N O

mathcal T and I A displaystyle mathcal Imodels mathcal A Inference edit Decision problems edit In addition to the ability to describe concepts formally one also would like to employ the description of a set of concepts to ask questions about the concepts and instances described The most common decision problems are basic databasequerylike questions like instance checking is a particular instance member of an Abox a member of a given concept and relation checking does a relationrole hold between two instances in other words does a have property b and the more globaldatabasequestions like subsumption is a concept a subset of another concept and concept consistency is there no contradiction among the definitions or chain of definitions The more operators one includes in a logic and the more complicated the Tbox having cycles allowing nonatomic concepts to include each other usually the higher the computational complexity is for each of these problems see Description Logic Complexity Navigator for examples Relationship with other logics edit Firstorder logic edit Many DLs are decidable fragments of firstorder logic FOL 5 and are usually fragments of twovariable logic or guarded logic In addition some DLs have features that are not covered in FOL this includes concrete domains such as integer or strings which can be used as ranges for roles such as hasAge or hasName or an operator on roles for the transitive closure of that role 5 Fuzzy description logic edit Fuzzy description logics combines fuzzy logic with DLs Since many concepts that are needed for intelligent systems lack well defined boundaries or precisely defined criteria of membership fuzzy logic is needed to deal with notions of vagueness and imprecision This offers a motivation for a generalization of description logic towards dealing with imprecise and vague concepts Modal logic edit Description logic is related tobut developed independently of modal logic ML 5 Manybut not allDLs are syntactic variants of ML 5 In general an object corresponds to a possible world a concept corresponds to a modal proposition and a rolebounded quantifier to a modal operator with that role as its accessibility relation Operations on roles such as composition inversion etc correspond to the modal operations used in dynamic logic 17 17 Examples edit Syntactic variants DL ML A L C displaystyle mathcal ALC K 5
