Content delivery network Left Single server distribution Right CDN scheme of distribution A content delivery network or content distribution network CDN is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers The goal is to provide high availability and high performance by distributing the service spatially relative to endusers CDNs came into existence in the late 1990s as a means for alleviating the performance bottlenecks of the Internet 1 2 even as the Internet was starting to become a missioncritical medium for people and enterprises Since then CDNs have grown to serve a large portion of the Internet content today including web objects text graphics and scripts downloadable objects media files software documents applications ecommerce portals live streaming media ondemand streaming media and social media sites 3 CDNs are a layer in the internet ecosystem Content owners such as media companies and ecommerce vendors pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users In turn a CDN pays ISPs carriers and network operators for hosting its servers in their data centers CDN is an umbrella term spanning different types of content delivery

P2P for delivery 55 Multi CDN 6 See also 7 References 8 Further reading Technology edit CDN nodes are usually deployed in multiple locations often over multiple backbones Benefits include reducing bandwidth costs improving page load times or increasing global availability of content The number of nodes and servers making up a CDN varies depending on the architecture some reaching thousands of nodes with tens of thousands of servers on many remote points of presence PoPs Others build a global network and have a small number of geographical PoPs 4 Requests for content are typically algorithmically directed to nodes that are optimal in some way When optimizing for performance locations that are best for serving content to the user may be chosen This may be measured by choosing locations that are the fewest hops the lowest number of network seconds away from the requesting client or the highest availability in terms of server performance both current and historical so as to optimize delivery across local networks When optimizing for cost locations that are least expensive may be chosen instead In an optimal scenario these two goals tend to align as edge servers that are close to the enduser at the edge of the network may have an advantage in performance or cost Most CDN providers will provide their services over a varying defined set of PoPs depending on the coverage desired such as United States International or Global AsiaPacific etc These sets of PoPs can be called edges edge nodes or edge networks as they would be the closest edge of CDN assets to the end user 5 The CDNs Edge Network grows outward from the origins through further acquisitions via purchase peering or exchange of colocations facilities bandwidth and servers Security and privacy edit CDN providers profit either from direct fees paid by content providers using their network or profit from the user analytics and tracking data collected as their scripts are being loaded onto customers websites inside their browser origin As such these services are being pointed out as potential privacy intrusion for the purpose of behavioral targeting 6 and solutions are being created to restore singleorigin serving and caching of resources 7 CDN networks serving JavaScript have been also targeted as a way to inject malicious content into pages using them SubResource Integrity mechanism was created in response to ensure that the page loads a script whose content is known and constrained to a hash referenced by the website author 8 Content networking techniques edit The Internet was designed according to the endtoend principle 9 This principle keeps the core network relatively simple and moves the intelligence as much as possible to the network endpoints the hosts and clients As a result the core network is specialized simplified and optimized to only forward data packets Content Delivery Networks augment the endtoend transport network by distributing on it a variety of intelligent applications employing techniques designed to optimize content delivery The resulting tightly integrated overlay uses web caching server load balancing request routing and content services 10 These techniques are briefly described below Web caches store popular content on servers that have the greatest demand for the content requested These shared network appliances reduce bandwidth requirements reduce server load and improve the client response times for content stored in the cache Web caches are populated based on requests from users pull caching or based on preloaded content disseminated from content servers push caching 11 Serverload balancing uses one or more techniques including servicebased global load balancing or hardwarebased ie layer 47 switches also known as a web switch content switch or multilayer switch to share traffic among a number of servers or web caches Here the switch is assigned a single virtual IP address Traffic arriving at the switch is then directed to one of the real web servers attached to the switch This has the advantage of balancing load increasing total capacity improving scalability and providing increased reliability by redistributing the load of a failed web server and providing server health checks A content cluster or service node can be formed using a layer 47 switch to balance load across a number of servers or a number of web caches within the network Request routing directs client requests to the content source best able to serve the request This may involve directing a client request to the service node that is closest to the client or to the one with the most capacity A variety of algorithms are used to route the request These include Global Server Load Balancing DNSbased request routing Dynamic metafile generation HTML rewriting 12 and anycasting 13 Proximitychoosing the closest service nodeis estimated using a variety of techniques including reactive probing proactive probing and connection monitoring 10 CDNs use a variety of methods of content delivery including but not limited to manual asset copying active web caches and global hardware load balancers Content service protocols edit Several protocol suites are designed to provide access to a wide variety of content services distributed throughout a content network The Internet Content Adaptation Protocol ICAP was developed in the late 1990s 14 15 to provide an open standard for connecting application servers A more recently defined and robust solution is provided by the Open Pluggable Edge Services OPES protocol 16 This architecture defines OPES service applications that can reside on the OPES processor itself or be executed remotely on a Callout Server Edge Side Includes or ESI is a small markup language for edge level dynamic web content assembly It is fairly common for websites to have generated content It could be because of changing content like catalogs or forums or because of the personalization This creates a problem for caching systems To overcome this problem a group of companies created ESI Peertopeer CDNs edit Further information Peertopeer network In peertopeer P2P contentdelivery networks clients provide resources as well as use them This means that unlike clientserver systems the content centric networks can actually perform better as more users begin to access the content especially with protocols such as Bittorrent that require users to share This property is one of the major advantages of using P2P networks because it makes the setup and running costs very small for the original content distributor 17 18 Private CDNs edit If content owners are not satisfied with the options or costs of a commercial CDN service they can create their own CDN This is called a private CDN A private CDN consists of POPs points of presence that are only serving content for their owner These POPs can be caching servers 19 reverse proxies or application delivery controllers 20 It can be as simple as two caching servers 19 or large enough to serve petabytes of content 21 Large content distribution networks may even build and set up their own private network to distribute copies of content across cache locations 22 23 Such private networks are usually used in conjunction with public networks as a backup option in case the capacity of private network is not enough or there is a failure which leads to capacity reduction Since the same content has to be distributed across many locations a variety of multicasting techniques may be used to reduce bandwidth consumption Over private networks it has also been proposed to select multicast trees according to network load conditions to more efficiently utilize available network capacity 24 25 CDN trends edit Emergence of telco CDNs edit The rapid growth of streaming video traffic 26 uses large capital expenditures by broadband providers 27 in order to meet this demand and to retain subscribers by delivering a sufficiently good quality of experience To address this telecommunications service providers TSPs have begun to launch their own content delivery networks as a means to lessen the demands on the network backbone and to reduce infrastructure investments Telco CDN advantages edit Because they own the networks over which video content is transmitted telco CDNs have advantages over traditional CDNs They own the last mile and can deliver content closer to the end user because it can be cached deep in their networks This deep caching minimizes the distance that video data travels over the general Internet and delivers it more quickly and reliably Telco CDNs also have a builtin cost advantage since traditional CDNs must lease bandwidth from them and build the operators margin into their own cost model In addition by operating their own content delivery infrastructure telco operators have a better control over the utilization of their resources Content management operations performed by CDNs are usually applied without or with very limited information about the network eg topology utilization etc of the telcooperators with which they interact or have business relationships These pose a number of challenges for the telcooperators which have a limited sphere of actions in face of the impact of these operations on the utilization of their resources In contrast the deployment of telcoCDNs allow operators to implement their own content management operations 28 29 which enables them to have better control over the utilization of their resources and as such provide better quality of service and experience to their end users Federated CDNs edit In June 2011 StreamingMediacom reported that a group of TSPs had founded an Operator Carrier Exchange OCX 30 to interconnect their networks and compete more directly against large traditional CDNs like Akamai and Limelight Networks which have extensive PoPs worldwide This way telcos are building a Federated CDN offering which is more interesting for a content provider willing to deliver its content to the aggregated audience of this federation It is likely that in a near future other telco CDN federations will be created They will grow by enrollment of new telcos joining the federation and bringing network presence and their Internet subscriber bases to the existing ones Improving CDN performance using the EDNS0 option edit The latency RTT experienced by clients with nonlocal resolvers high reduced drastically when a CDN rolledout the EDNS0 extension in April 2014 while the latency of clients with local resolvers are unimpacted by the change low 31 Traditionally CDNs have used the IP of the clients recursive DNS resolver to geolocate the client While this is a sound approach in many situations this leads to poor client performance if the client uses a nonlocal recursive DNS resolver that is far away For instance a CDN may route requests from a client in India to its edge server in Singapore if that client uses a public DNS resolver in Singapore causing poor performance for that client Indeed a recent study 31 showed that in many countries where public DNS resolvers are in popular use the median distance between the clients and their recursive DNS resolvers can be as high as a thousand miles In August 2011 a global consortium of leading Internet service providers led by Google announced their official implementation of the ednsclientsubnet IETF InternetDraft 32 which is intended to accurately localize DNS resolution responses The initiative involves a limited number of leading DNS service providers such as Google Public DNS 33 and CDN service providers as well With the ednsclientsubnet EDNS0 option CDNs can now utilize the IP address of the requesting clients subnet when resolving DNS requests This approach called enduser mapping 31 has been adopted by CDNs and it has been shown to drastically reduce the roundtrip latencies and improve performance for clients who use public DNS or other nonlocal resolvers However the use of EDNS0 also has drawbacks as it decreases the effectiveness of caching resolutions at the recursive resolvers 31 increases the total DNS resolution traffic 31 and raises a privacy concern of exposing the clients subnet Virtual CDN vCDN edit Virtualization technologies are being used to deploy virtual CDNs vCDNs with the goal to reduce content provider costs and at same time increase elasticity and decrease service delay With vCDNs it is possible to avoid traditional CDN limitations such as performance reliability and availability since virtual caches are deployed dynamically as virtual machines or containers in physical servers distributed across the provider geographical coverage As the virtual cache placement is based on both the content type and serverenduser geographic location the vCDNs have a significant impact on service delivery and network congestion 34 35 36 37 Notable content delivery service providers edit
