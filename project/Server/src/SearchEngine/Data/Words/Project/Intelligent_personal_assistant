Virtual assistant For the human occupation see Virtual assistant occupation Mobile software agent Google Assistant running on a Pixel XL smartphone Apple TV remote control with which users can ask Siri virtual assistant to find content to watch Amazon Echo smart speaker running the Alexa virtual assistant An intelligent virtual assistant IVA or intelligent personal assistant IPA is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions Sometimes the term chatbot is used to refer to virtual assistants generally or specifically accessed by online chat In some cases online chat programs are exclusively for entertainment purposes Some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices Users can ask their assistants questions control home automation devices and media playback via voice and manage other basic tasks such as email todo lists and calendars with verbal spoken commands 1 A similar concept however with differences lays under the dialogue systems 2 As of 2017 the capabilities and usage of virtual assistants are expanding rapidly with new products entering the market and a strong emphasis on both email and voice user interfaces Apple and Google have large installed bases of users on smartphones Microsoft has a large installed base of Windows based personal computers smartphones and smart speakers Amazon has a large install base for smart speakers 3 Conversica has over 100 million engagements via its email and sms interface Intelligent Virtual Assistants for business Contents 1

7 Comparison of notable assistants 8 Economic relevance 9 Security 10 See also 11 References History edit Radio Rex was the first voice activated toy released in 1911 4 Another early tool which was enabled to perform digital speech recognition was the IBM Shoebox presented to the general public during the 1962 Seattle Worlds Fair after its initial market launch in 1961 This early computer developed almost 20 years before the introduction of the first IBM Personal Computer in 1981 was able to recognize 16 spoken words and the digits 0 to 9 The next milestone in the development of voice recognition technology was achieved in the 1970s at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania with substantial support of the United States Department of Defense and its DARPA agency Their tool Harpy mastered about 1000 words the vocabulary of a threeyearold About ten years later the same group of scientists developed a system that could analyze not only individual words but entire word sequences enabled by a Hidden Markov Model 5 Thus the earliest virtual assistants which applied speech recognition software were automated attendant and medical digital dictation software 6 In the 1990s digital speech recognition technology became a feature of the personal computer with Microsoft IBM Philips and Lernout Hauspie fighting for customers Much later the market launch of the first smartphone IBM Simon in 1994 laid the foundation for smart virtual assistants as we know them today 7 The first modern digital virtual assistant installed on a smartphone was Siri which was introduced as a feature of the iPhone 4S on October 4 2011 8 Apple Inc developed Siri following the 2010 acquisition of Siri Inc a spinoff of SRI International which is a research institute financed by DARPA and the United States Department of Defense 5 Method of interaction edit Virtual assistants make work via Text including online chat especially in an instant messaging app or other app SMS Text email or other textbased communication channel for example Conversica s Intelligent Virtual Assistants for business 9 Voice for example with Amazon Alexa 10 on the Amazon Echo device Siri on an iPhone or Google Assistant on Googleenabled Android mobile devices By taking andor uploading images as in the case of Samsung Bixby on the Samsung Galaxy S8 Some virtual assistants are accessible via multiple methods such as Google Assistant via chat on the Google Allo and Google Messages app and via voice on Google Home smart speakers Virtual assistants use natural language processing NLP to match user text or voice input to executable commands Many continually learn using artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning To activate a virtual assistant using the voice a wake word might be used This is a word or groups of words such as Hey Siri OK Google or Hey Google Alexa and Hey Microsoft 11 Devices and objects where found edit Virtual assistants may be integrated into many types of platforms or like Amazon Alexa across several of them Into devices like smart speakers such as Amazon Echo Google Home and Apple HomePod In instant messaging apps on both smartphones and via the Web eg Facebook s M virtual assistant on both Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps or via the Web Built into a mobile operating system OS as are Apple s Siri on iOS devices and BlackBerry Assistant on BlackBerry 10 devices or into a desktop OS such as Cortana on Microsoft Windows OS Built into a smartphone independent of the OS as is Bixby on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8 12 Within instant messaging platforms assistants from specific organizations such as Aeromexico s Aerobot on Facebook Messenger or Wechat Secretary on WeChat Within mobile apps from specific companies and other organizations such as Dom from Dominos Pizza 13 In appliances 14 cars 15 and wearable technology 16 Previous generations of virtual assistants often worked on websites such as Alaska Airlines Ask Jenn 17 or on interactive voice response IVR systems such as American Airlines IVR by Nuance 18 Services edit Virtual assistants can provide a wide variety of services These include 19 Provide information such as weather facts from eg Wikipedia or IMDb set an alarm make todo lists and shopping lists Play music from streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora play radio stations read audiobooks Play videos TV shows or movies on televisions streaming from eg Netflix Conversational commerce see below Assist public interactions with government see Artificial intelligence in government Complement andor replace customer service by humans 20 One report estimated that an automated online assistant produced a 30 decrease in the workload for a humanprovided call centre 21 Conversational commerce edit Main article Conversational commerce Conversational commerce is ecommerce via various means of messaging including via voice assistants 22 but also live chat on ecommerce Web sites live chat on messaging apps such as WeChat Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp 23 and chatbots on messaging apps or Web sites Thirdparty services edit Amazon enables Alexa Skills and Google Actions essentially apps that run on the assistant platforms Virtual assistant privacy edit Main article Virtual assistant privacy Virtual assistants have a variety of privacy concerns associated with them Features such as activation by voice pose a threat as such features requires the device to always be listening 24 Modes of privacy such as the virtual security button have been proposed to create a multilayer authentication for virtual assistants 25 Developer platforms edit Notable developer platforms for virtual assistants include Amazon Lex was opened to developers in April 2017 It involves natural language understanding technology combined with automatic speech recognition and had been introduced in November 2016 26 Google provides the Actions on Google and Dialogflow platforms for developers to create Actions for Google Assistant 27 Apple provides SiriKit for developers to create extensions for Siri IBM s Watson while sometimes spoken of as a virtual assistant is in fact an entire artificial intelligence platform and community powering some virtual assistants chatbots and many other types of solutions 28 29 Previous generations edit In previous generations of text chatbased virtual assistants the assistant was often represented by an avatar aka interactive online character or automated character this was known as an embodied agent Comparison of notable assistants edit

be among the major recent technological advances and most promising consumer trends Experts claim that digital experiences will achieve a statusweight comparable to real experiences if not become more soughtafter and prized 33 The trend is verified by a high number of frequent users and the substantial growth of worldwide user numbers of virtual digital assistants In mid2017 the number of frequent users of digital virtual assistants is estimated to be around 1 bn worldwide 34 In addition it can be observed that virtual digital assistant technology is no longer restricted to smartphone applications but present across many industry sectors incl automotive telecommunications retail healthcare and education 35 In response to the significant RD expenses of firms across all sectors and an increasing implementation of mobile devices the market for speech recognition technology is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 349 globally over the period of 2016 to 2024 and thereby surpass a global market size of US75 billion by 2024 35 According to an Ovum study the native digital assistant installed base is projected to exceed the worlds population by 2021 with 75 billion active voice AIcapable devices 36 According to Ovum by that time Google Assistant will dominate the voice AIcapable device market with 233 market share followed by Samsungs Bixby 145 Apples Siri 131 Amazons Alexa 39 and Microsofts Cortana 23 36 Taking into consideration the regional distribution of market leaders North American companies eg Nuance Communications IBM eGain are expected to dominate the industry over the next years due to the significant impact of BYOD Bring Your Own Device and enterprise mobility business models Furthermore the increasing demand for smartphoneassisted platforms are expected to further boost the North American Intelligent Virtual Assistant IVA industry growth Despite its smaller size in comparison to the North American market the intelligent virtual assistant industry from the AsiaPacific region with its main players located in India and China is predicted to grow at an annual growth rate of 40 above global average over the 20162024 period 35 Security edit In May 2018 researchers from the University of California Berkeley published a paper that showed audio commands undetectable for the human ear could be directly embedded into music or spoken text thereby manipulating virtual assistants into performing certain actions without the user taking note of it 37 The researchers made small changes to audio files which cancelled out the sound patterns that speech recognition systems are meant to detect These were replaced with sounds that would be interpreted differently by the system and command it to dial phone numbers open websites or even transfer money 37 The possibility of this has been known since 2016 37 and affects devices from Apple Amazon and Google 38 In addition to unintentional actions and voice recording another security and privacy risk associated with intelligent virtual assistants is malicious voice commands An attacker who impersonates a user and issues malicious voice commands to for example unlock a smart door to gain unauthorized entry to a home or garage or order items online without the users knowledge Although some IVAs provide a voicetraining feature to prevent such impersonation it can be difficult for the system to distinguish between similar voices Thus a malicious person who is able to access an IVAenabled device might be able to fool the system into thinking that he or she is the real owner and carry out criminal or mischievous acts 39 See also edit Applications of artificial intelligence Chatbot Conversational user interface Computer facial animation Expert system Home network Intelligent
