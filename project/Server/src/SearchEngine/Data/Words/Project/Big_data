Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze systematically extract information from or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional dataprocessing application software Data with many cases rows offer greater statistical power while data with higher complexity more attributes or columns may lead to a higher false discovery rate 2 Big data challenges include capturing data data storage data analysis search sharing transfer visualization querying updating information privacy and data source Big data was originally associated with three key concepts volume variety and velocity When we handle big data we may not sample but simply observe and track what happens Therefore big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and value Current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics user behavior analytics or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data and seldom to a particular size of data set There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large but thats not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem 3 Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to spot business trends prevent diseases combat crime and so on 4 Scientists business executives practitioners of medicine advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large datasets in areas including Internet searches fintech urban informatics and business informatics Scientists encounter limitations in eScience work including meteorology genomics 5 connectomics complex physics simulations biology and environmental research 6 Data sets grow rapidly to a certain extent because they are increasingly gathered by cheap and numerous informationsensing Internet of things devices such as mobile devices aerial remote sensing software logs cameras microphones radiofrequency identification RFID readers and wireless sensor networks 7 8 The worlds technological percapita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s 9 as of 2012 update every day 25 exabytes 2510 18 of data are generated 10 Based on an IDC report prediction the global data volume will grow exponentially from 44 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020 By 2025 IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data 11 One question for large enterprises is determining who should own bigdata initiatives that affect the entire organization 12 Relational database management systems desktop statistics clarification needed and software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty handling big data The work may require massively parallel software running on tens hundreds or even thousands of servers 13 What qualifies as being big data varies depending on the capabilities of the users and their tools and expanding capabilities make big data a moving target For some organizations facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options For others it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration 14 Contents 1 Definition 2 Characteristics 3 Architecture 4 Technologies 5 Applications 51 Government 52 International development 53

been in use since the 1990s with some giving credit to John Mashey for popularizing the term 15 16 Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture curate manage and process data within a tolerable elapsed time 17 Big data philosophy encompasses unstructured semistructured and structured data however the main focus is on unstructured data 18 Big data size is a constantly moving target as of 2012 update ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data 19 Big data requires a set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from datasets that are diverse complex and of a massive scale 20 Variety veracity and various other Vs are added by some organizations to describe it a revision challenged by some industry authorities 21 A 2018 definition states Big data is where parallel computing tools are needed to handle data and notes This represents a distinct and clearly defined change in the computer science used via parallel programming theories and losses ofsome of the guarantees and capabilities made by Codds relational model 22 The growing maturity of the concept more starkly delineates the difference between big data and Business Intelligence 23 Business Intelligence uses applied mathematics tools and descriptive statistics with data with high information density to measure things detect trends etc Big data uses mathematical analysis optimization inductive statistics and concepts from nonlinear system identification 24 to infer laws regressions nonlinear relationships and causal effects from large sets of data with low information density 25 to reveal relationships and dependencies or to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors 24 26 promotional source Characteristics edit Shows the growth of big datas primary characteristics of volume velocity and variety Big data can be described by the following characteristics Volume The quantity of generated and stored data The size of the data determines the value and potential insight and whether it can be considered big data or not Variety The type and nature of the data This helps people who analyze it to effectively use the resulting insight Big data draws from text images audio video plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion Velocity The speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development Big data is often available in realtime Compared to small data big data are produced more continually Two kinds of velocity related to big data are the frequency of generation and the frequency of handling recording and publishing 27 Veracity It is the extended definition for big data which refers to the data quality and the data value 28 The data quality of captured data can vary greatly affecting the accurate analysis 29 Data must be processed with advanced tools analytics and algorithms to reveal meaningful information For example to manage a factory one must consider both visible and invisible issues with various components Information generation algorithms must detect and address invisible issues such as machine degradation component wear etc on the factory floor 30 31 Other important characteristics of Big Data are 32 Exhaustive Whether the entire system ie n textstyle n all is captured or recorded or not Finegrained and uniquely lexical Respectively the proportion of specific data of each element per element collected and if the element and its characteristics are properly indexed or identified Relational If the data collected contains commons fields that would enable a conjoining or metaanalysis of different data sets Extensional If new fields in each element of the data collected can be added or changed easily Scalability If the size of the data can expand rapidly Value The utility that can be extracted from the data Variability It refers to data whose value or other characteristics are shifting in relation to the context they are being generated Architecture edit Big data repositories have existed in many forms often built by corporations with a special need Commercial vendors historically offered parallel database management systems for big data beginning in the 1990s For many years WinterCorp published the largest database report 33 promotional source Teradata Corporation in 1984 marketed the parallel processing DBC 1012 system Teradata systems were the first to store and analyze 1 terabyte of data in 1992 Hard disk drives were 25GB in 1991 so the definition of big data continuously evolves according to Kryders Law Teradata installed the first petabyte class RDBMS based system in 2007 As of 2017 update there are a few dozen petabyte class Teradata relational databases installed the largest of which exceeds 50 PB Systems up until 2008 were 100 structured relational data Since then Teradata has added unstructured data types including XML JSON and Avro In 2000 Seisint Inc now LexisNexis Risk Solutions developed a C based distributed platform for data processing and querying known as the HPCC Systems platform This system automatically partitions distributes stores and delivers structured semistructured and unstructured data across multiple commodity servers Users can write data processing pipelines and queries in a declarative dataflow programming language called ECL Data analysts working in ECL are not required to define data schemas upfront and can rather focus on the particular problem at hand reshaping data in the best possible manner as they develop the solution In 2004 LexisNexis acquired Seisint Inc 34 and their highspeed parallel processing platform and successfully utilized this platform to integrate the data systems of Choicepoint Inc when they acquired that company in 2008 35 In 2011 the HPCC systems platform was opensourced under the Apache v20 License CERN and other physics experiments have collected big data sets for many decades usually analyzed via highthroughput computing rather than the mapreduce architectures usually meant by the current big data movement In 2004 Google published a paper on a process called MapReduce that uses a similar architecture The MapReduce concept provides a parallel processing model and an associated implementation was released to process huge amounts of data With MapReduce queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and processed in parallel the Map step The results are then gathered and delivered the Reduce step The framework was very successful 36 so others wanted to replicate the algorithm Therefore an implementation of the MapReduce framework was adopted by an Apache opensource project named Hadoop 37 Apache Spark was developed in 2012 in response to limitations in the MapReduce paradigm as it adds the ability to set up many operations not just map followed by reducing MIKE20 is an open approach to information management that acknowledges the need for revisions due to big data implications identified in an article titled Big Data Solution Offering 38 The methodology addresses handling big data in terms of useful permutations of data sources complexity in interrelationships and difficulty in deleting or modifying individual records 39 2012 studies showed that a multiplelayer architecture is one option to address the issues that big data presents A distributed parallel architecture distributes data across multiple servers these parallel execution environments can dramatically improve data processing speeds This type of architecture inserts data into a parallel DBMS which implements the use of MapReduce and Hadoop frameworks This type of framework looks to make the processing power transparent to the enduser by using a frontend application server 40 The data lake allows an organization to shift its focus from centralized control to a shared model to respond to the changing dynamics of information management This enables quick segregation of data into the data lake thereby reducing the overhead time 41 42 Big data analytics for manufacturing applications is marketed as a

Institute report characterizes the main components and ecosystem of big data as follows 46 Techniques for analyzing data such as AB testing machine learning and natural language processing Big data technologies like business intelligence cloud computing and databases Visualization such as charts graphs and other displays of the data Multidimensional big data can also be represented as OLAP data cubes or mathematically tensors Array Database Systems have set out to provide storage and highlevel query support on this data typeAdditional technologies being applied to big data include efficient tensorbased computation 47 such as multilinear subspace learning 48 massively parallelprocessing MPP databases searchbased applications data mining 49 distributed file systems distributed cache eg burst buffer and Memcached distributed databases cloud and HPCbased infrastructure applications storage and computing resources 50 and the Internet citation needed Although many approaches and technologies have been developed it still remains difficult to carry out machine learning with big data 51 Some MPP relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data Implicit is the ability to load monitor back up and optimize the use of the large data tables in the RDBMS 52 promotional source DARPA s Topological Data Analysis program seeks the fundamental structure of massive data sets and in 2008 the technology went public with the launch of a company called Ayasdi 53 thirdparty source needed The practitioners of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower shared storage 54 preferring directattached storage DAS in its various forms from solid state drive SSD to high capacity SATA disk buried inside parallel processing nodes The perception of shared storage architectures Storage area network SAN and Networkattached storage NAS is that they are relatively slow complex and expensive These qualities are not consistent with big data analytics systems that thrive on system performance commodity infrastructure and low cost Real or nearreal time information delivery is one of the defining characteristics of big data analytics Latency is therefore avoided whenever and wherever possible Data in directattached memory or disk is gooddata on memory or disk at the other end of a FC SAN connection is not The cost of a SAN at the scale needed for analytics applications is very much higher than other storage techniques There are advantages as well as disadvantages to shared storage in big data analytics but big data analytics practitioners as of 2011 update did not favour it 55 promotional source Applications edit Bus wrapped with SAP Big data parked outside IDF13 Big data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that Software AG Oracle Corporation IBM Microsoft SAP EMC HP and Dell have spent more than 15billion on software firms specializing in data management and analytics In 2010 this industry was worth more than 100billion and was growing at almost 10percent a year about twice as fast as the software business as a whole 4 Developed economies increasingly use dataintensive technologies There are 46billion mobilephone subscriptions worldwide and between 1billion and 2billion people accessing the internet 4 Between 1990 and 2005 more than 1billion people worldwide entered the middle class which means more people became more literate which in turn led to information growth The worlds effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes in 1986 471 petabytes in 1993 22 exabytes in 2000 65 exabytes in 2007 9 and predictions put the amount of internet traffic at 667 exabytes annually by 2014 4 According to one estimate onethird of the globally stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data 56 which is the format most useful for most big data applications This also shows the potential of yet unused data ie in the form of video and audio content While many vendors offer offtheshelf solutions for big data experts recommend the development of inhouse solutions customtailored to solve the companys problem at hand if the company has sufficient technical capabilities 57 Government edit The use and adoption of big data within governmental processes allows efficiencies in terms of cost productivity and innovation 58 but does not come without its flaws Data analysis often requires multiple parts of government central and local to work in collaboration and create new and innovative processes to deliver the desired outcome CRVS Civil Registration and Vital Statistics collects all certificates status from birth to death CRVS is a source of big data for governments International development edit Research on the effective usage of information and communication technologies for development also known as ICT4D suggests that big data technology can make important contributions but also present unique challenges to International development 59 60 Advancements in big data analysis offer costeffective opportunities to improve decisionmaking in critical development areas such as health care employment economic productivity crime security and natural disaster and resource management 61 62 63 Additionally usergenerated data offers new opportunities to give the unheard a voice 64 However longstanding challenges for developing regions such as inadequate technological infrastructure and economic and human resource scarcity exacerbate existing concerns with big data such as privacy imperfect methodology and interoperability issues 61 Manufacturing edit Based on TCS 2013 Global Trend Study improvements in supply planning and product quality provide the greatest benefit of big data for manufacturing Big data provides an infrastructure for transparency in the manufacturing industry which is the ability to unravel uncertainties such as inconsistent component performance and availability Predictive manufacturing as an applicable approach toward nearzero downtime and transparency requires a vast amount of data and advanced prediction tools for a systematic process of data into useful information 65 A conceptual framework of predictive manufacturing begins with data acquisition where different type of sensory data is available to acquire such as acoustics vibration pressure current voltage and controller data A vast amount of sensory data in addition to historical data construct the big data in manufacturing The generated big data acts as the input into predictive tools and preventive strategies such as Prognostics and Health Management PHM 66 67 Healthcare edit Big data analytics has helped healthcare improve by providing personalized medicine and prescriptive analytics clinical risk intervention and predictive analytics waste and care variability reduction automated external and internal reporting of patient data standardized medical terms and patient registries and fragmented point solutions 68 69 70 71 Some areas of improvement are more aspirational than actually implemented The level of data generated within healthcare systems is not trivial With the added adoption of mHealth eHealth and wearable technologies the volume of data will continue to increase This includes electronic health record data imaging data patient generated data sensor data and other forms of difficult to process data There is now an even greater need for such environments to pay greater attention to data and information quality 72 Big data very often means dirty data and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume growth Human inspection at the big data scale is impossible and there is a desperate need in health service for intelligent tools for accuracy and believability control and handling of information missed 73 While extensive information in healthcare is now electronic it fits under the big data umbrella as most is unstructured and difficult to use 74 The use of big data in healthcare has raised significant ethical challenges ranging from risks for individual rights privacy and autonomy to transparency and trust 75 Big data in health research is particularly promising in terms of exploratory biomedical research as datadriven analysis can move forward more quickly than hypothesisdriven research 76 Then trends seen in data analysis can be tested in traditional hypothesisdriven followup biological research and eventually clinical research A related application subarea that heavily relies on big data within the healthcare field is that of computeraided diagnosis in medicine 77 One only needs to recall that for instance for epilepsy monitoring it is customary to create 5 to 10 GB of data daily 78 Similarly a single uncompressed image of breast tomosynthesis averages 450 MB of data 79 These are just few of the many examples where computeraided diagnosis uses big data For this reason big data has been recognized as one of the seven key challenges that computeraided diagnosis systems need to overcome in order to reach the next level of performance 80 Education edit A McKinsey Global Institute study found a shortage of 15 million highly trained data professionals and managers 46 and a number of universities 81 bettersourceneeded including University of Tennessee and UC Berkeley have created masters programs to meet this demand Private boot camps have also developed programs to meet that demand including free programs like The Data Incubator or paid programs like General Assembly 82 In the specific field of marketing one of the problems stressed by Wedel and Kannan 83 is that marketing has several sub domains eg advertising promotionsproduct development branding that all use different types of data Because onesizefitsall analytical solutions are not desirable business schools should prepare marketing managers to have wide knowledge on all the different techniques used in these sub domains to get a big picture and work effectively with analysts Media edit To understand how the media utilizes big data it is first necessary to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that practitioners in Media and Advertising approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals The industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers magazines or television shows and instead taps into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations The ultimate aim is to serve or convey a message or content that is statistically speaking in line with the consumers mindset For example publishing environments are increasingly tailoring messages advertisements and content articles to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various datamining activities 84 Targeting of consumers for advertising by marketers 85 Data capture Data journalism publishers and journalists use big data tools to provide unique and innovative insights and infographics Channel 4 the British publicservice television broadcaster is a leader in the field of big data and data analysis 86 Insurance edit Health insurance providers are collecting data on social determinants of health such as food and TV consumption marital status clothing size and purchasing habits from which they make predictions on health costs in order to spot health issues in their clients It is controversial whether these predictions are currently being used for pricing 87 Internet of Things IoT edit Main article Internet of Things Further information Edge computing Big data and the IoT work in conjunction Data extracted from IoT devices provides a mapping of device interconnectivity Such mappings have been used by the media industry companies and governments to more accurately target their audience and increase media efficiency IoT is also increasingly adopted as a means of gathering sensory data and this sensory data has been used in medical 88 manufacturing 89 and transportation 90 contexts Kevin Ashton digital innovation expert who is credited with coining the term 91 defines the Internet of Things in this quote If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about thingsusing data they gathered without any help from uswe would be able to track and count everything and greatly reduce waste loss and cost We would know when things needed replacing repairing or recalling and whether they were fresh or past their best Information technology edit Especially since 2015 big data has come to prominence within business operations as a tool to help employees work more efficiently and streamline the collection and distribution of information technology IT The use of big data to resolve IT and data collection issues within an enterprise is called IT operations analytics ITOA 92 By applying big data principles into the concepts of machine intelligence and deep computing IT departments can predict potential issues and move to provide solutions before the problems even happen 92 In this time ITOA businesses were also beginning to play a major role in systems management by offering platforms that brought individual data silos together and generated insights from the whole of the system rather than from isolated pockets of data Case studies edit Government edit China edit The Integrated Joint Operations Platform IJOP 一体化联合作战平台 is used by the government to monitor the population particularly Uyghurs 93 Biometrics including DNA samples are gathered through a program of free physicals 94 By 2020 China plans to give all its citizens a personal Social Credit score based on how they behave 95 The Social Credit System now being piloted in a number of Chinese cities is considered a form of mass surveillance which uses big data analysis technology 96 97 India edit Big data analysis was tried out for the BJP to win the Indian General Election 2014 98 The Indian government utilizes

to aid irrigation regulation 99 Personalized diabetic treatments can be created through GlucoMes big data solution 100 United Kingdom edit Examples of uses of big data in public services Data on prescription drugs by connecting origin location and the time of each prescription a research unit was able to exemplify the considerable delay between the release of any given drug and a UKwide adaptation of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines This suggests that new or most uptodate drugs take some time to filter through to the general patient 101 Joining up data a local authority blended data about services such as road gritting rotas with services for people at risk such as meals on wheels The connection of data allowed the local authority to avoid any weatherrelated delay 102 United States of America edit In 2012 the Obama administration announced the Big Data Research and Development Initiative to explore how big data could be used to address

drive times to and from work throughout various times of the day 112 FICO Card Detection System protects accounts worldwide 113 Science edit The Large Hadron Collider experiments represent about 150 million sensors delivering data 40million times per second There are nearly 600million collisions per second After filtering and refraining from recording more than 9999995 114 of these streams there are 1000 collisions of interest per second 115 116 117 As a result only working with less than 0001 of the sensor stream data the data flow from all four LHC experiments represents 25 petabytes annual rate before replication as of 2012 update This becomes nearly 200 petabytes after replication If all sensor data were recorded in LHC the data flow would be extremely hard to work with The data flow would exceed 150 million petabytes annual rate or nearly 500 exabytes per day before replication To put the number in perspective this is equivalent to 500 quintillion 510 20 bytes per day almost 200 times more than all the other sources combined in the world The Square Kilometre Array is a radio telescope built of thousands of antennas It is expected to be operational by 2024 Collectively these antennas are expected to gather 14 exabytes and store one petabyte per day 118 119 It is considered one of the most ambitious scientific projects ever undertaken 120 When the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS began to collect astronomical data in 2000 it amassed more in its first few weeks than all data collected in the history of astronomy previously Continuing at a rate of about 200GB per night SDSS has amassed more than 140 terabytes of information 4 When the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope successor to SDSS comes online in 2020 its designers expect it to acquire that amount of data every five days 4 Decoding the human genome originally took 10 years to process now it can be achieved in less than a day The DNA sequencers have divided the sequencing cost by 10000 in the last ten years which

data was demonstrated in March 2014 at the American Society of Engineering Education Gautam Siwach engaged at Tackling the challenges of Big Data by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Dr Amir Esmailpour at UNH Research Group investigated the key features of big data as the formation of clusters and their interconnections They focused on the security of big data and the orientation of the term towards the presence of different types of data in an encrypted form at cloud interface by providing the raw definitions and realtime examples within the technology Moreover they proposed an approach for identifying the encoding technique to advance towards an expedited search over encrypted text leading to the security enhancements in big data 142 In March 2012 The White House announced a national Big Data Initiative that consisted of six Federal departments and agencies committing more than 200million to big data research projects 143 The initiative included a National Science Foundation Expeditions in Computing grant of 10 million over 5 years to the AMPLab 144 at the University of California Berkeley 145 The AMPLab also received funds from DARPA and over a dozen industrial sponsors and uses big data to attack a wide range of problems from predicting traffic congestion 146 to fighting cancer 147 The White House Big Data Initiative also included a commitment by the Department of Energy to provide 25 million in funding over 5 years to establish the scalable Data Management Analysis and Visualization SDAV Institute 148 led by the Energy Departments Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory The SDAV Institute aims to bring together the expertise of six national laboratories and seven universities to develop new tools to help scientists manage and visualize data on the Departments supercomputers The US state of Massachusetts announced the Massachusetts Big Data Initiative in May 2012 which provides funding from the state government and private companies to a variety of research institutions 149 The Massachusetts Institute of Technology hosts the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory combining government corporate and institutional funding and research efforts 150 The European Commission is funding the 2yearlong Big Data Public Private Forum through their Seventh Framework Program to engage companies academics and other stakeholders in discussing big data issues The project aims to define a strategy in terms of research and innovation to guide supporting actions from the European Commission in the successful implementation of the big data economy Outcomes of this project will be used as input for Horizon 2020 their next framework program 151 The British government announced in March 2014 the founding of the Alan Turing Institute named after the computer pioneer and codebreaker which will focus on new ways to collect

the understanding and appeal of big data sets and communicate their story to the world 153 The National Science Foundation has granted the industryuniversity cooperative research center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems IMS to focus on developing advanced predictive tools and techniques to be applicable in a big data environment 154 In May 2013 the IMS Center held an industry advisory board meeting focusing on big data where presenters from various industrial companies discussed their concerns issues and future goals in the big data environment Computational social sciences Anyone can use Application Programming Interfaces APIs provided by big data holders such as Google and Twitter to do research in the social and behavioral sciences 155 Often these APIs are provided for free 155 Tobias Preis et al used Google Trends data to demonstrate that Internet users from countries with a higher per capita gross domestic product GDP are more likely to search for information about the future than information about the past The findings suggest there may be a link between online behaviour and realworld economic indicators 156 157 158 The authors of the study examined Google queries logs made by ratio of the volume of searches for the coming year 2011 to the volume of searches for the previous year 2009 which they call the future orientation index 159 They compared the future orientation index to the per capita GDP of each country and found a strong tendency for countries where Google users inquire more about the future to have a higher GDP The results hint that there may potentially be a relationship between the economic success of a country and the informationseeking behavior of its citizens captured in big data Tobias Preis and his colleagues Helen Susannah Moat and H Eugene Stanley introduced a method to identify online precursors for stock market moves using trading strategies based on search volume data provided by Google Trends 160 Their analysis of Google search volume for 98 terms of varying financial relevance published in Scientific Reports 161 suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 Big data sets come with algorithmic challenges that previously did not exist Hence there is a need to fundamentally change the processing ways 169 The Workshops on Algorithms for Modern Massive Data Sets MMDS bring together computer scientists statisticians mathematicians and data analysis practitioners to discuss algorithmic challenges of big data 170 Regarding big data one needs to keep in mind that such concepts of magnitude are relative As it is stated If the past is of any guidance then todays big data most likely will not be considered as such in the near future 77 Sampling big data edit An important research question that can be asked about big data sets is whether you need to look at the full data to draw certain conclusions about the properties of the data or is a sample good enough The name big data itself contains a term related to size and this is an important characteristic of big data But Sampling statistics enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population For example there are about 600 million tweets produced every day Is it necessary to look at all of them to determine the topics that are discussed during the day Is it necessary to look at all the tweets to determine the sentiment on each of the topics In manufacturing different types of sensory data such as acoustics vibration pressure current voltage and controller data are available at short time intervals To predict downtime it may not be necessary to look at all the data but a sample may be sufficient Big Data can be broken down by various data point categories such as demographic psychographic behavioral and transactional data With large sets of data points marketers are able to create and utilize more customized segments of consumers for more strategic targeting There has been some work done in Sampling algorithms for big data A theoretical formulation for sampling Twitter data has been developed 171 Critique edit Critiques of the big data paradigm come in two flavors those that question the implications of the approach itself and those that question the way it is currently done 172 One approach to this criticism is the field of critical data studies Critiques of the big data paradigm edit A crucial problem is that we do not know much about the underlying empirical microprocesses that lead to the emergence of these typical network characteristics of Big Data 17 In their critique Snijders Matzat and Reips point out that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is really going on at the level of microprocesses Mark Graham has leveled broad critiques at Chris Anderson s assertion that big data will spell the end of theory 173 focusing in particular on the notion that big data must always be contextualized in their social economic and political contexts 174 Even as companies invest eight and ninefigure sums to derive insight from information streaming in from suppliers and customers less than 40 of employees have sufficiently mature processes and skills to do so To overcome this insight deficit big data no matter how comprehensive or well analyzed must be complemented by big judgment according to an article in the Harvard Business Review 175 Much in the same line it has been pointed out that the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably informed by the world as it was in the past or at best as it currently is 61 Fed by a large number of data on past experiences algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past 176 If the systems dynamics of the future change if it is not a stationary process the past can say little about the future In order to make predictions in changing environments it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic which requires theory 176 As a response to this critique Alemany Oliver and Vayre suggest to use abductive reasoning as a first step in the research process in order to bring context to consumers digital traces and make new theories emerge 177 Additionally it has been suggested to combine big data approaches with computer simulations such as agentbased models 61 and complex systems Agentbased models are increasingly getting better in predicting the outcome of social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that are based on a collection of mutually interdependent algorithms 178 179 Finally the use of multivariate methods that probe for the latent structure of the data such as factor analysis and cluster analysis have proven useful as analytic approaches that go well beyond the bivariate approaches crosstabs typically employed with smaller data sets In health and biology conventional scientific approaches are based on experimentation For these approaches the limiting factor is the relevant data that can confirm or refute the initial hypothesis 180 A new postulate is accepted now in biosciences the information provided by the data in huge volumes omics without prior hypothesis is complementary and sometimes necessary to conventional approaches based on experimentation 181 182 In the massive approaches it is the formulation of a relevant hypothesis to explain the data that is the limiting factor 183 The search logic is reversed and the limits of induction Glory of Science and Philosophy scandal C D Broad 1926 are to be considered citation needed Privacy advocates are concerned about the threat to privacy represented by increasing storage and integration of personally identifiable information expert panels have released various policy recommendations to conform practice to expectations of privacy 184 185 186 The misuse of Big Data in several cases by media companies and even the government has allowed for abolition of trust in almost every fundamental institution holding up society 187 Nayef AlRodhan argues that a new kind of social contract will be needed to protect individual liberties in a context of Big Data and giant corporations that own vast amounts of information The use of Big Data should be monitored and better regulated at the national and international levels 188 Barocas and Nissenbaum argue that one way of protecting individual users is by being informed about the types of information being collected with whom it is shared under what constrains and for what purposes 189 Critiques of the V model edit The V model of Big Data is concerting as it centres around computational scalability and lacks in a loss around the perceptibility and understandability of information This led to the framework of cognitive big data which characterizes Big Data application according to 190 Data completeness understanding of the nonobvious from data Data correlation causation and predictability causality as not essential requirement to achieve predictability Explainability and interpretability humans desire to understand and accept what they understand where algorithms dont cope with this Level of automated decision making algorithms that support automated decision making and algorithmic selflearning Critiques of novelty edit Large data sets have been analyzed by computing machines for well over a century including the US census analytics performed by IBM s punch card machines which computed statistics including means and variances of populations across the whole continent In more recent decades science experiments such as CERN have produced data on similar scales to current commercial big data However science experiments have tended to analyze their data using specialized custombuilt high performance computing supercomputing clusters and grids rather than clouds of cheap commodity computers as in the current commercial wave implying a difference in both culture and technology stack Critiques of big data execution edit UlfDietrich Reips and Uwe Matzat wrote in 2014 that big data had become a fad in scientific research 155 Researcher Danah Boyd has raised concerns about the use of big data in science neglecting principles such as choosing a representative sample by being too concerned about handling the huge amounts of data 191 This approach may lead to results bias in one way or another Integration across heterogeneous data resourcessome that might be considered big data and others notpresents formidable logistical as well as analytical challenges but many researchers argue that such integrations are likely to represent the most promising new frontiers in science 192 In the provocative article Critical Questions for Big Data 193 the authors title big data a part of mythology large data sets offer a higher form of intelligence and knowledge with the aura of truth objectivity and accuracy Users of big data are often lost in the sheer volume of numbers and working with Big Data is still subjective and what it quantifies does not necessarily have a closer claim on objective truth 193 Recent developments in BI domain such as proactive reporting especially target improvements in usability of big data through automated filtering of nonuseful data and correlations 194 Big structures are full of spurious correlations 195 either because of noncausal coincidences law of truly large numbers solely nature of big randomness 196 Ramsey theory or existence of non included factors so the hope of early experimenters to make large databases of numbers speak for themselves and revolutionize scientific method is questioned 197 Big data analysis is often shallow compared to analysis of smaller data sets 198 In many big data projects there is no large data analysis happening but the challenge is the extract transform load part of data preprocessing 198 Big data is a buzzword and a vague term 199 200 but at the same time an obsession 200 with entrepreneurs consultants scientists and the media Big data showcases such as Google Flu Trends failed to deliver good predictions in recent years overstating the flu outbreaks by a factor of two Similarly Academy awards and election predictions solely based on Twitter were more often off than on targetBig data often poses the same challenges as small data adding more data does not solve problems of bias but may emphasize other problems In particular data sources such as Twitter are not representative of the overall population and results drawn from such sources may then lead to wrong conclusions Google Translate which is based on big data statistical analysis of textdoes a good job at translating web pages However results from specialized domains may be dramatically skewedOn the other hand big data may also introduce new problems such as the multiple comparisons problem simultaneously testing a large set of hypotheses is likely to produce many false results that mistakenly appear significantIoannidis argued that most published research findings are false 201 due to essentially the same effect when many scientific teams and researchers each perform many experiments ie process a big amount of scientific data although not with big data technology the likelihood of a significant result being false grows fast even more so when only positive results are publishedFurthermore big data analytics results are only as good as the model on which they are predicated In an example big data took part in attempting to predict the results of the 2016 US Presidential Election 202 with varying degrees of success Critiques of big data policing and surveillance edit Big Data has been used in policing and surveillance by institutions like law enforcement and corporations 203 Due to the less visible nature of databased surveillance as compared to traditional method of policing objections to big data policing are less likely to arise According to Sarah Braynes Big Data Surveillance The Case of Policing 204 big data policing can reproduce existing societal inequalities in three ways Placing suspected criminals under increased surveillance by using the justification of a mathematical and therefore unbiased algorithm Increasing the scope and number of people that are subject to law enforcement tracking and exacerbating existing racial overrepresentation in the criminal justice system Encouraging members of society to abandon interactions with institutions that would create a digital trace thus creating obstacles to social inclusion If these potential problems are not corrected or regulating the effects of big data policing continue to shape societal hierarchies Conscientious usage of big data policing could prevent individual level biases from becoming institutional biases Brayne also notes See also edit For a list of companies and tools see also CategoryBig data Big data ethics Big Data Maturity Model Big memory Data
