Spouses William KingNoel 1st Earl of Lovelace Children Byron KingNoel Viscount Ockham and 12th Baron Wentworth Anne Blunt 15th Baroness Wentworth Ralph KingMilbanke 2nd Earl of Lovelace Augusta Ada King Countess of Lovelace née Byron 10 December 1815 27 November 1852 was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage s proposed mechanical generalpurpose computer the Analytical Engine She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine As a result she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a computing machine and one of the first computer programmers 2 3 4 Lovelace was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and his wife Lady Byron 5 All of Byrons other children were born out of wedlock to other women 6 Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins Is thy face like thy mothers my fair child ADA sole daughter of my house and heart 7 He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old Her mother remained bitter and promoted Adas interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her fathers perceived insanity Despite this Ada remained interested in Byron Upon her eventual death she was buried next to him at her request Although often ill in her childhood Ada pursued her studies assiduously She married William King in 1835 King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838 Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse Charles Babbage Sir David Brewster Charles Wheatstone Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens contacts which she used to further her education Ada described her approach as poetical science 8 and herself as an Analyst Metaphysician 9 When she was a teenager her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage who is known as the father of computers She was in particular interested in Babbages work on the Analytical Engine Lovelace first met him in June 1833 through their mutual friend and her private tutor Mary Somerville Between 1842 and 1843 Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes simply called Notes These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer programthat is an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbages personal notes from the years 18361837 contain the first programs for the engine 10 Lovelaces notes are important in the early history of computers She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or numbercrunching while many others including Babbage himself focused only on those capabilities 11 Her mindset of poetical science led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine as shown in her notes examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool 6 She died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36 Contents 1 Biography 11

Byron aged four Lord Byron expected his child to be a glorious boy and was disappointed when Lady Byron gave birth to a girl 12 The child was named after Byrons halfsister Augusta Leigh and was called Ada by Byron himself 13 On 16 January 1816 at Lord Byrons command Lady Byron left for her parents home at Kirkby Mallory taking their fiveweekold daughter with her 12 Although English law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights 14 but did request that his sister keep him informed of Adas welfare 15 Ada Byron aged seven by Alfred dOrsay 1822 Somerville College Oxford On 21 April Lord Byron signed the deed of separation although very reluctantly and left England for good a few days later 16 Aside from an acrimonious separation Lady Byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husbands immoral behaviour 17 This set of events made Lovelace infamous in Victorian society She did not have a relationship with her father He died in 1824 when she was eight years old Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life 18 Lovelace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her 20th birthday 19 Lovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith Hon Lady Milbanke who doted on her However because of societal attitudes of the timewhich favoured the husband in any separation with the welfare of any child acting as mitigationLady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughters welfare with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern 20 In one letter to Lady Milbanke she referred to her daughter as it I talk to it for your satisfaction not my own and shall be very glad when you have it under your own 21 Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation Lovelace dubbed these observers the Furies and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her 22 Ada Byron aged seventeen 1832 Lovelace was often ill beginning in early childhood At the age of eight she experienced headaches that obscured her vision 13 In June 1829 she was paralysed after a bout of measles She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year something which may have extended her period of disability By 1831 she was able to walk with crutches Despite the illnesses she developed her mathematical and technological skills mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 When Ada was twelve years old this future Lady Fairy as Charles Babbage affectionately called her decided she wanted to fly Ada Byron went about the project methodically thoughtfully with imagination and passion Her first step in February 1828 was to construct wings She investigated different material and sizes She considered various materials for the wings paper oilsilk wires and feathers She examined the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body She decided to write a book Flyology illustrating with plates some of her findings She decided what equipment she would need for example a compass to cut across the country by the most direct road so that she could surmount mountains rivers and valleys Her final step was to integrate steam with the art of flying 6 Ada Byron had an affair with a tutor in early 1833 She tried to elope with him after she was caught but the tutors relatives recognised her and contacted her mother Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal 23 Lovelace never met her younger halfsister Allegra the daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Clairmont Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five Lovelace did have some contact with Elizabeth Medora Leigh the daughter of Byrons halfsister Augusta Leigh who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court 24 Adult years Watercolour portrait of Ada King Countess of Lovelace circa 1840 possibly by Alfred Edward Chalon Lovelace became close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833 She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville 25 and they corresponded for many years Other acquaintances included the scientists Andrew Crosse Sir David Brewster Charles Wheatstone Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens She was presented at Court at the age of seventeen and became a popular belle of the season in part because of her brilliant mind 26 By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events She danced often and was able to charm many people and was described by most people as being dainty although John Hobhouse Byrons friend described her as a large coarseskinned young woman but with something of my friends features particularly the mouth 27 This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him probably due to her mothers influence which led her to dislike all of her fathers friends This first impression was not to last and they later became friends 28 On 8 July 1835 she married William 8th Baron King becoming Lady King 29 They had three homes Ockham Park Surrey a Scottish estate on Loch Torridon in Rossshire and a house in London They spent their honeymoon at Worthy Manor in Ashley Combe near Porlock Weir Somerset The Manor had been built as a hunting lodge in 1799 and was improved by King in preparation for their honeymoon It later became their summer retreat and was further improved during this time From 1845 the familys main house was East Horsley Towers rebuilt in the Victorian Gothic fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament Charles Barry 30 31 They had three children Byron born 12 May 1836 Anne Isabella called Annabella born 22 September 1837 and Ralph Gordon born 2 July 1839 Immediately after the birth of Annabella Lady King experienced a tedious and suffering illness which took months to cure 28 Ada was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace and in 1838 her husband was made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham 32 meaning Ada became the Countess of Lovelace 33 In 184344 Adas mother assigned William Benjamin Carpenter to teach Adas children and to act as a moral instructor for Ada 34 He quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an unbecoming manner When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair Ada cut it off 35 In 1841 Lovelace and Medora Leigh the daughter of Lord Byrons halfsister Augusta Leigh were told by Adas mother that her father was also Medoras father 36 On 27 February 1841 Ada wrote to her mother I am not in the least astonished In fact you merely confirm what I have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected 37 She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron but instead blamed Augusta Leigh I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was 38 In the 1840s Ada flirted with scandals firstly from a relaxed approach to extramarital relationships with men leading to rumours of affairs 39 and secondly from her love of gambling She apparently lost more than 3000 on the horses during the later 1840s 40 The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets This went disastrously wrong leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate forcing her to admit it all to her husband 41 She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosses son John from 1844 onwards John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her 42 During her final illness she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her 43 Education Throughout her illnesses she continued her education 44 Her mothers obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by William Frend William King a and Mary Somerville the noted 19thcentury researcher and scientific author One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician Augustus De Morgan From 1832 when she was seventeen her mathematical abilities began to emerge 26 and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life In a letter to Lady Byron De Morgan suggested that her daughters skill in mathematics could lead her to become an original mathematical investigator perhaps of firstrate eminence 45 Lovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science While studying differential calculus she wrote to De Morgan I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of who are at ones elbows in one shape now and the next minute in a form most dissimilar 46 Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics viewing both as tools for exploring the unseen worlds around us 47 Death Painting of Lovelace seated at a piano by Henry Phillips 1852 Although in great pain at the time she agreed to sit for the painting as her father Lord Byron had been painted by Phillips father Thomas Phillips Lovelace died at the age of 36 the same age at which her father had died on 27 November 1852 48 from uterine cancer probably exacerbated by bloodletting by her physicians 49 The illness lasted several months in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw and excluded all of her friends and confidants Under her mothers influence she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor 50 She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside It is not known what she told him 51 She was buried at her request next to her father at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Hucknall Nottinghamshire A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers Work Throughout her life Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day including phrenology 52 and mesmerism 53 After her work with Babbage Lovelace continued to work on other projects In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings a calculus of the nervous system 54 She never achieved this however In part her interest in the brain came from a longrunning preoccupation inherited from her mother about her potential madness As part of her research into this project she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments 55 In the same year she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach Researches on Magnetism but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft 56 In 1851 the year before her cancer struck she wrote to her mother mentioning certain productions she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music 57 Portrait of Ada by British painter Margaret Sarah Carpenter 1836 Lovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833 through their mutual friend Mary Somerville Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine 58 She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could Babbage was impressed by Lovelaces intellect and analytic skills He called her The Enchantress of Number 59 b In 1843 he wrote to her Forget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multitudinous Charlatansevery thing in short but the Enchantress of Number 59 During a ninemonth period in 184243 Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea s article on Babbages newest proposed machine the Analytical Engine With the article she appended a set of notes 60 Explaining the Analytical Engines function was a difficult task as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it 61 Lovelaces notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine 62 Her work was well received at the time the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing 63 The notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include in Note G 64 in complete detail a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine which might have run correctly had it ever been built 65 only Babbages Difference Engine has been built completed in London in 2002 66 Based on this work Lovelace is now widely considered to be the first computer programmer 2 and her method is recognised as the worlds first computer program 67 Note G also contains Lovelaces dismissal of artificial intelligence She wrote that The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform It can follow analysis but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal for example by Alan Turing in his paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence 68 Lovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published when he tried to leave his own statement criticising the governments treatment of his Engine as an unsigned preface which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration When Taylor s Scientific Memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised that His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Adas involvement and so happily indulged her because of her celebrated name 69 Their friendship recovered and they continued to correspond On 12 August 1851 when she was dying of cancer Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as Philosophers Walk as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles 63 First computer program Lovelaces diagram from note G the first published computer algorithm In 1840 Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine Luigi Menabrea a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy transcribed Babbages lecture into French and this transcript was subsequently published in the Bibliothèque universelle de Genève in October 1842Babbages friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabreas paper into English She then augmented the paper with notes which were added to the translation Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this assisted with input from Babbage These notes which are more extensive than Menabreas paper were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylors Scientific Memoirs under the initialism AAL 70 Ada Lovelaces notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G In note G she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason 71 72 The engine was never completed so her program was never tested 73 In 1953 more than a century after her death Ada Lovelaces notes on Babbages Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to BV Bowden s Faster than Thought A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines 74 The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software 65 Insight into potential of computing devices In her notes Lovelace emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity 75 She realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching In her notes she wrote The Analytical Engine might act upon other things besides number were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engineSupposing for instance that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent 76 77 This analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised Walter Isaacson ascribes Lovelaces insight regarding the application of computing to any process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles When she saw some mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns it reminded her of how Babbages engine used punched cards to make calculations 78 This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley as well as the programmer John GrahamCumming whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine 79 80 81 According to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist Doron Swade Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see In Babbages world his engines were bound by numberWhat Lovelace sawwhat Ada Byron sawwas that number could represent entities other than quantity So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers if those numbers represented other things letters musical notes then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance according to rules It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computationto generalpurpose computationand looking back from the present high ground of modern computing if we are looking and sifting history for that transition then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper 2 Controversy over her actual contribution Though Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer some biographers computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise Allan G Bromley in the 1990 article Difference and Analytical Engines All but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier The exception was prepared by Babbage for her although she did detect a bug in it Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so 82 Bruce Collier who later wrote a biography of Babbage wrote in his 1970 Harvard University PhD thesis that Lovelace made a considerable contribution to publicizing the Analytical Engine but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way 83 Eugene Eric Kim and Betty Alexandra Toole consider it incorrect to regard Lovelace as the first computer programmer as Babbage wrote the initial programs for his Analytical Engine although the majority were never published 84 Bromley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by Babbage between 1837 and 1840 all substantially predating Lovelaces notes 85 Dorothy K Stein regards Lovelaces notes as more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author the political purposes of the inventor and above all of the social and cultural context in which it was written than a blueprint for a scientific development 86 In his book Idea Makers Stephen Wolfram defends Lovelaces contributions While acknowledging that Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the Analytical Engine prior to Lovelaces notes Wolfram argues that theres nothing as sophisticatedor as cleanas Adas computation of the Bernoulli numbers Babbage certainly helped and commented on Adas work but she was definitely the driver of it Wolfram then suggests that Lovelaces main achievement was to distill from Babbages correspondence a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machinesomething which Babbage never did citation needed Doron Swade a specialist on history of computing known for his work on Babbage analysed four claims about Lovelace during a lecture on Babbages analytical engine She was a mathematical genius She made an influential contribution to the analytical engine She was the first computer programmer She was a prophet of the computer age According to him only the fourth claim had any substance at all He explained that Ada was only a promising beginner instead of genius in mathematics that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after Babbage conceived the analytical engine so she could not have made important contributions to it and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it But he agrees that Ada was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities 87 In popular culture An illustration inspired by the A E Chalon portrait created for the Ada Initiative which supported open technology and women 1810s Lord Byron wrote in 1816 the poem Fare Thee Well to his wife Lady Byron after their separation after the birth of Ada Lovelace born in 10 December 1815 about her he wrote in the poem And when thou wouldst solace gatherWhen our childs first accents flowWilt thou teach her to say Father Though his care she must forego When her little hands shall press theeWhen her lip to thine is pressdThink of him whose prayer shall bless theeThink of him thy love had blessd 40 Should her lineaments resembleThose thou never more mayst seeThen thy heart will softly trembleWith a pulse yet true to me 88 1970s Lovelace has been portrayed in Romulus Linney s 1977 play Childe Byron 89 1990s In the 1990 steampunk novel The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling 90 Ada Lovelace delivers a lecture on the punched cards programme that proves two theorems the discovery that in reality would not be made until 1931 by Kurt Gödel In the 1997 film Conceiving Ada 91 a computer scientist obsessed with Countess Ada Lovelace finds a way of communicating with Lovelace in the past by means of undying information waves In Tom Stoppard s 1993 play Arcadia the precocious teenage genius Thomasina Coverly a character apparently based on Ada Lovelacethe play also involves Lord Byron comes to understand chaos theory and theorises the second law of thermodynamics before either is officially recognised 92 93 2010s In John Crowley s 2005 novel Lord Byrons Novel The Evening Land where she is featured as an unseen character whose personality is forcefully depicted in her annotations and antiheroic efforts to archive her fathers lost novel 94 The 2015 play Ada and the Memory Engine by Lauren Gunderson portrays Lovelace and Charles Babbage in unrequited love and it imagines a postdeath meeting between Lovelace and her father 95 96 Lovelace and Babbage are the main characters in Sydney Padua s webcomic and graphic novel The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage The comic features extensive footnotes on the history of Ada Lovelace and many lines of dialogue are drawn from actual correspondence 97 Lovelace and Mary Shelley as teenagers are the central characters in Jordan Stratford s steampunk series The Wollstonecraft Detective Agency 98 Lovelace identified as Ada Augusta Byron is portrayed by Lily Lesser in the second season of The Frankenstein Chronicles She is employed as an analyst to provide the workings of a lifesized humanoid automaton The brass workings of the machine are reminiscent of Babbages analytical engine Her employment is described as keeping her occupied until she returns to her studies in advanced mathematics 99 As of November 2015 all new British passports have included an illustration of Lovelace and Babbage on pages 46 and 47 100 101 In 2017 a Google Doodle honoured her on International Womens Day 102 Lovelace and Babbage appear as characters in the second season of the ITV series Victoria 2017 Emerald Fennell portrays Lovelace in the episode The GreenEyed
