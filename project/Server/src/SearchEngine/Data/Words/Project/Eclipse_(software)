Ukrainian Vietnamese 5 Type Programming tool integrated development environment IDE License Eclipse Public Website www eclipse org Eclipse is an integrated development environment IDE used in computer programming 6 It contains a base workspace and an extensible plugin system for customizing the environment Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications but it may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages via plugins including Ada ABAP C C C Clojure COBOL D Erlang Fortran Groovy Haskell JavaScript Julia 7 Lasso Lua NATURAL Perl PHP Prolog Python R Ruby including Ruby on Rails framework Rust Scala and Scheme It can also be used to develop documents with LaTeX via a TeXlipse plugin and packages for the software Mathematica Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools JDT for Java and Scala Eclipse CDT for CC and Eclipse PDT for PHP among others The initial codebase originated from IBM VisualAge 8 The Eclipse software development kit SDK which includes the Java development tools is meant for Java developers Users can extend its abilities by installing plugins written for the Eclipse Platform such as development toolkits for other programming languages and can write and contribute their own plugin modules Since the introduction of the OSGi implementation Equinox in version 3 of Eclipse plugins can be pluggedstopped dynamically and are termed OSGI bundles 9 Eclipse software development kit SDK is free and opensource software released under the terms of the Eclipse Public License although it is incompatible with the GNU General Public License 10 It was one of the first IDEs to run under GNU Classpath and it runs without problems under IcedTea Contents 1 History 11 Licensing 12

Development Tools 92 Android Development Tools 10 See also 11 References 12 Sources 13 External links History edit Eclipse was inspired by the Smalltalk based VisualAge family of integrated development environment IDE products 8 Although fairly successful a major drawback of the VisualAge products was that developed code was not in a componentbased software engineering model Instead all code for a project was held in a compressed lump somewhat like a zip file but in a proprietary format called dat Individual classes could not be easily accessed certainly not outside the tool A team primarily at the IBM Cary NC lab developed the new product as a Javabased replacement 11 In November 2001 a consortium was formed with a board of stewards to further the development of Eclipse as opensource software It is estimated that IBM had already invested nearly 40 million by that time 12 The original members were Borland IBM Merant QNX Software Systems Rational Software Red Hat SuSE TogetherSoft and WebGain 13 The number of stewards increased to over 80 by the end of 2003 In January 2004 the Eclipse Foundation was created 14 Eclipse 30 released on 21 June 2004 selected the OSGi Service Platform specifications as the runtime architecture 15 The Association for Computing Machinery recognized Eclipse with the 2011 ACM Software Systems Award on 26 April 2012 16 Licensing edit The Eclipse Public License EPL is the fundamental license under which Eclipse projects are released 17 Some projects require dual licensing for which the Eclipse Distribution License EDL is available although use of this license must be applied for and is considered on a casebycase basis Eclipse was originally released under the Common Public License but was later relicensed under the Eclipse Public License The Free Software Foundation has said that both licenses are free software licenses but are incompatible with the GNU General Public License GPL 18 Name edit According to Lee Nackman Chief Technology Officer of IBMs Rational division originating in 2003 at that time the name Eclipse dating from at least 2001 was not a wordplay on Sun Microsystems as the products primary competition at the time of naming was Microsoft Visual Studio which Eclipse was to eclipse 19 Different versions of Eclipse have been given different sciencerelated names The versions named after Callisto Europa and Ganymede which are moons of Jupiter were followed by a version named after Galileo the discoverer of those moons These were followed by two sunthemed names Helios of Greek mythology and Indigo one of the seven colors of a rainbow which is produced by the sun The version after that Juno has a triple meaning a Roman mythological figure an asteroid and a spacecraft to Jupiter 20 Kepler Luna and Mars continued the astronomy theme and then Neon and Oxygen constituted a theme of chemical elements Photon represented a return to sunthemed names As of 2018 update the alphabetic scheme was abandoned and instead releases are named in the format YYYYMM 21 Starting with version 49 the project has opted for dropping that naming convention in order to better align with new Simultaneous Release strategy and adopt a datebased naming convention to reflect the quarterly releases 22 Releases edit Since 2006 the Foundation has coordinated an annual Simultaneous Release 23 Each release includes the Eclipse Platform and several other Eclipse projects From 2008 through 2018 each Simultaneous Release had occurred on the 4th Wednesday of June In 2018 the project switched to quarterly 13 week YYYYMM releases without intermediate service releases 24 Version name Date Platform version Projects Main changes NA 21 June 2004 Old version no longer supported 30 25 NA 28 June

supported Latest version Latest preview version Future release There is a 38 release of Eclipse Juno it is not promoted on the main downloads page but a packaged distribution is available for download 34 Eclipse 38 provides bugfixes for Indigo adds Java 7 support and its maintenance was dual streamed with 42 35 Features and plugins equivalent to a packaged distribution may be added from within the IDE Architecture edit Eclipse uses plugins to provide all the functionality within and on top of the runtime system Its runtime system is based on Equinox an implementation of the OSGi core framework specification 52 In addition to allowing the Eclipse Platform to be extended using other programming languages such as C and Python the plugin framework allows the Eclipse Platform to work with typesetting languages like LaTeX 53 and networking applications such as telnet and database management systems The plugin architecture supports writing any desired extension to the environment such as for configuration management Java and CVS support is provided in the Eclipse SDK with support for other version control systems provided by thirdparty plugins With the exception of a small runtime kernel everything in Eclipse is a plugin Thus every plugin developed integrates with Eclipse in the same way as other plugins in this respect all features are created equal 54 Eclipse provides plugins for a wide variety of features some of which are from third parties using both free and commercial models Examples of plugins include for Unified Modeling Language UML for Sequence and other UML diagrams a plugin for DB Explorer and many more The Eclipse SDK includes the Eclipse Java development tools JDT offering an IDE with a builtin Java incremental compiler and a full model of the Java source files This allows for advanced refactoring techniques and code analysis The IDE also makes use of a workspace in this case a set of metadata over a flat filespace allowing external file modifications as long as the corresponding workspace resource is refreshed afterward Eclipse implements the graphical control elements of the Java toolkit called Standard Widget Toolkit SWT whereas most Java applications use the Java standard Abstract Window Toolkit AWT or Swing Eclipses user interface also uses an intermediate graphical user interface layer called JFace which simplifies the construction of applications based on SWT Eclipse was made to run on Wayland during a Google Summer of Code GSoC Project in 2014 55 As of 2017 update language packs being developed by the Babel Project provide translations into over 40 natural languages 5 Rich client platform edit Eclipse provides the rich client platform RCP for developing generalpurpose applications The following components constitute the rich client platform Equinox OSGi a standard bundling framework Core platform boot Eclipse run plugins citation needed Standard Widget Toolkit SWT a portable widget toolkit JFace viewer classes to bring model view controller programming to SWT file buffers text handling text editors Eclipse Workbench views editors perspectives wizards Examples of rich client applications based on Eclipse are IBM Notes 8 and 9 AttachmateNovell NetIQ Designer for Identity Manager Apache Directory Studio Remote Component Environment DBeaver Server platform edit Eclipse supports development for Tomcat GlassFish and many other servers and is often capable of installing the required server for development directly from the IDE It supports remote debugging allowing a user to watch variables and step through the code of an application that is running on the attached server Web Tools Platform edit The Eclipse Web Tools Platform WTP project is an extension of the Eclipse platform with tools for developing Web and Java EE applications It includes source and graphical editors for a variety of languages wizards and builtin applications to simplify development and tools and APIs to support deploying running and testing apps 56 Modeling platform edit The Modeling project contains all the official projects of the Eclipse Foundation focusing on modelbased development technologies All are compatible with the Eclipse Modeling Framework created by IBM Those projects are separated in several categories Model Transformation Model Development Tools Concrete Syntax Development Abstract Syntax Development Technology and Research and Amalgam Model Transformation projects uses Eclipse Modeling Framework EMF based models as an input and produce either a model or text as an output Model to model transformation projects includes ATLAS Transformation Language ATL an open source transformation language and toolkit used to transform a given model or to generate a new model from a given EMF model Model to text transformation projects contains Acceleo an implementation of MOFM2T a standard model to text language from the Object Management Group OMG The Acceleo code generator can generate any textual language Java PHP Python etc from EMF based models defined with any metamodel Unified Modeling Language UML Systems Modeling Language SysML etc It is opensource Model Development Tools projects are implementations of various modeling standards used in the industry and their toolkits Among those projects can be found implementations of several standards Unified Modeling Language UML Systems Modeling Language SysML Object Constraint Language OCL Business Process Model and Notation BPMN Interactive Media Manager IMM Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules SBVR XML Schema XSD National Electronic Distributors Association NEDA The Concrete Syntax Development project contains the Graphical Modeling Framework an Eclipsebased framework dedicated to the graphical representation of EMF based models citation needed The Abstract Syntax Development project hosts the Eclipse Modeling Framework core of most of the modeling project of the Eclipse Foundation and the framework available for EMF like Connected Data Objects CDO EMF query or EMF validation Technology and Research projects are prototypes of Modeling project this project is used to host all the modeling projects of the Eclipse Foundation during their incubation phase citation needed Amalgam provides the packaging and integration between all the available modeling tools for the Eclipse package dedicated to modeling tools 57 Application lifecycle management edit Application lifecycle management ALM and task management in Eclipse need on an optional component called Mylyn ˈ m aɪ l ɪ n an opensource implementation of the taskfocused interface It provides an API for tools embedding the taskfocused interface For software developers it helps a developer work efficiently with many different tasks such as bugs problem reports or new features Tasks are integrated into Mylyn For all tasks that have been integrated Mylyn monitors user activity and tries to identify information relevant to the task at hand It uses this task context to focus the Eclipse UI on the related information Mylyn can integrate with repositories such as Bugzilla Trac Redmine Mantis 58 JIRA Unfuddle 59 and GitHub 60 It focuses on improving productivity by reducing searching scrolling and navigation By making task context explicit Mylyn is also meant to facilitate multitasking planning reusing past efforts and sharing expertise The project name comes from myelin an electrically insulating layer that surrounds neurons axons 61 The original name of this project Mylar replicated a trademark of a boPET film company so the Eclipse Foundation changed the project name 62 Extensions edit Eclipse supports a rich selection of extensions adding support for Python via PyDev Android development via Googles ADT JavaFX via efxclipse JavaScript jQuery and many others at the Eclipse Marketplace Valable is a Vala plugin for Eclipse 63 Alternative distributions edit Several alternative distributions exist in the Eclipse project PHP Development Tools edit Further information PHP Development Tools The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor PHP Development Tools project provides a framework for the Eclipse platform The project encompasses all development components including codecompletion develop PHP and facilitate extensibility It leverages the existing Eclipse Web Tools Platform WTP and Dynamic Languages Toolkit DLTK 64 Android Development Tools edit Android Development Tools ADT was superseded in 2015 by the Eclipse foundations own plugin called Andmore Development Tools for Android 65 after Google discontinued development of their plugin for the Eclipse IDE that is designed to provide an integrated environment in which to build Android applications ADTAndmore extends the abilities of Eclipse to let developers set up new Android projects create an application UI add packages based on the Android Framework API debug their applications using the Android SDK tools and export signed or unsigned apk files in order to distribute their applications It is freely available to download Googles ADT was the official IDE for Android until 2015 but was replaced by Eclipses Andmore and the official Android Studio 66 67 See also edit Computer programming portal Free and opensource software portal Comparison of integrated development environments
