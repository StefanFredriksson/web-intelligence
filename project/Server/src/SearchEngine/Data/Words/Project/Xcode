code for the programming languages C C ObjectiveC ObjectiveC Java AppleScript Python Ruby ResEdit Rez and Swift with a variety of programming models including but not limited to Cocoa Carbon and Java Third parties have added support for GNU Pascal 4 Free Pascal 5 Ada 6 C 7 Perl 8 and D 9 Xcode can build fat binary files containing code for multiple architectures with the MachO executable format These are called universal binary files which allow software to run on both PowerPC and Intel based x86 platforms and that can include both 32bit and 64bit code for both architectures Using the iOS SDK Xcode can also be used to compile and debug applications for iOS that run on ARM architecture processors Xcode includes the GUI tool Instruments which runs atop a dynamic tracing framework DTrace created by Sun Microsystems and released as part of OpenSolaris Composition edit The main application of the suite is the integrated development environment IDE also named Xcode The Xcode suite includes most of Apples developer documentation and builtin Interface Builder an application used to construct graphical user interfaces Up to Xcode 41 the Xcode suite included a modified version of the GNU Compiler Collection In Xcode 31 up to Xcode 463 it included the LLVMGCC compiler with front ends from the GNU Compiler Collection and a code generator based on LLVM 10 In Xcode 32 and later it included the Clang CCObjectiveC compiler with newlywritten front ends and a code generator based on LLVM and the Clang static analyzer 11 Starting with Xcode 42 the Clang compiler became the default compiler 12 Starting with Xcode 50 Clang was the only compiler provided Up to Xcode 463 the Xcode suite used the GNU Debugger GDB as the backend for the IDEs debugger Starting with Xcode 43 the LLDB debugger was also provided starting with Xcode 45 LLDB replaced GDB as the default backend for the IDEs debugger 13 Starting with Xcode 50 GDB was no longer supplied 14 Removed features edit Formerly Xcode supported distributing a product build process over multiple systems One technology involved was named Shared Workgroup Build which used the Bonjour protocol to automatically discover systems providing compiler services and a modified version of the free software product distcc to facilitate the distribution of workloads Earlier versions of Xcode provided a system named Dedicated Network Builds These features are absent in the supported versions of Xcode Xcode also includes Apples WebObjects tools and frameworks for building Java web applications and web services formerly sold as a separate product As of Xcode 30 Apple dropped 15 WebObjects development inside Xcode WOLips 16 should be used instead Xcode 3 still includes the WebObjects frameworks Version history edit 1x series edit Xcode 10 was released in fall 2003 Xcode 10 was based on Project Builder but had an updated user interface UI ZeroLink Fix Continue distributed build support and Code Sense indexing The next significant release Xcode 15 had better code completion and an improved debugger 2x series edit Xcode 20 was released with Mac OS X v104 Tiger It included the Quartz Composer visual programming language better Code Sense indexing for Java and Ant support It also included the Apple Reference Library tool which allows searching and reading online documentation from Apples website and documentation installed on a local computer Xcode 21 could create universal binary files It supported shared precompiled headers unit testing targets conditional breakpoints and watchpoints It also had better dependency analysis The final version of Xcode for Mac OS X v104 was 25 3x series edit Xcode 30 was released with Mac OS X v105 Leopard Notable changes since 21 include 17 the DTrace debugging tool now named Instruments refactoring support contextsensitive documentation and ObjectiveC 20 with garbage collection It also supports Project Snapshots which provide a basic form of version control Message Bubbles which show build errors debug values alongside code and building fourarchitecture fat binaries 32 and 64bit Intel and PowerPC Xcode 31 was an update release of the developer tools for Mac OS X and was the same version included with the iPhone SDK It could target nonMac OS X platforms including iPhone OS 20 It included the GCC 42 and LLVM GCC 42 compilers Another new feature since Xcode 30 is that Xcodes SCM support now includes Subversion 15 Xcode 32 was released with Mac OS X v106 Snow Leopard and installs on no earlier version of OS X It supports static program analysis among other features It also drops official support for targeting versions earlier than iPhone OS 30 But it is still possible to target older versions and the simulator supports iPhone OS 20 through 31 Also Java support is exiled in 32 to the organizer 18 Xcode 326 is the last version that can be downloaded for free for users of Mac OS X v106 Downloading it requires a free registration at Apples developer site 4x series edit In June 2010 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference version 4 of Xcode was announced during the Developer Tools State of the Union address Version 4 of the developer tools consolidates the Xcode editing tools and Interface Builder into one application among other enhancements 19 20 Apple released the final version of Xcode 40 on March 9 2011 The software was made available for free to all registered members of the 99 per year Mac Developer program and the 99 per year iOS Developer program It was also sold for 499 to nonmembers on the Mac App Store no longer available Xcode 40 drops support for many older systems including all PowerPC development and software development kits SDKs for Mac OS X 104 and 105 and all iOS SDKs older than 43 The deployment target can still be set to produce binaries for those older platforms but for Mac OS platforms one is then limited to creating x86 and x8664 binaries Later Xcode was free to the general public Before version 41 Xcode cost 499 21 Xcode 41 was made available for free on July 20 2011 the day of Mac OS X Lion s release to all users of Mac OS X Lion on the Mac App Store On August
