in 1900 in Pittsburgh 14 by the Scottish American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie who wrote the timehonored words My heart is in the work when he donated the funds to create the institution Carnegies vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of workingclass Pittsburghers many of whom worked in his mills Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn New York founded by industrialist Charles Pratt in 1887 15 In 1912 the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology CIT and began offering fouryear degrees During this time CIT consisted of four constituent schools the School of Fine and Applied Arts the School of Apprentices and Journeymen the School of Science and Technology and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers Andrew Mellon who went on to become US Treasury Secretary and Richard B Mellon in honor of their father Thomas Mellon patriarch of the Mellon family The Institute began as a research organization which performed work for government and industry on a contract and was initially established as a department within the University of Pittsburgh In 1927 the Mellon Institute incorporated as an independent nonprofit In 1937 the Mellon Institutes iconic building was completed and it moved to its new and current location on Fifth Avenue 16 In 1967 with support from Paul Mellon Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellons coordinate womens college the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College closed in 1973 and merged its academic programs with the rest of the university 17 Andrew Mellon cofounder of the Mellon Institute The industrial research mission of the Mellon Institute survived the merger as the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute CMRI and continued doing work on contract to industry and government CMRI closed in 2001 and its programs were subsumed by other parts of the university or spun off into autonomous entities 18 Campus edit The main campus in Pittsburgh as seen from the 36th floor of the Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh August 2015 Carnegie Mellons 140acre 57ha 5 main campus is three miles 5km from downtown Pittsburgh between Schenley Park and the Squirrel Hill Shadyside and Oakland neighborhoods Carnegie Mellon is bordered to the west by the campus of the University of Pittsburgh Carnegie Mellon owns 81 buildings in the Oakland and Squirrel Hill neighborhoods of Pittsburgh For decades the center of student life on campus was Skibo Hall the Universitys student union Built in the 1950s Skibo Halls design was typical of MidCentury Modern architecture but was poorly equipped to deal with advances in computer and internet connectivity The original Skibo was razed in the summer of 1994 and replaced by a new student union that is fully wifi enabled Known as University Center the building was dedicated in 1996 In 2014 Carnegie Mellon rededicated the University Center as the Cohon University Center in recognition of the eighth president of the university Jared Cohon 19 A large grassy area known as the Cut forms the backbone of the campus with a separate grassy area known as the Mall running perpendicular The Cut was formed by filling in a ravine hence the name with soil from a nearby hill that was leveled to build the College of Fine Arts building The northwestern part of the campus home to Hamburg Hall NewellSimon Hall Smith Hall and Gates Hillman Complex was acquired from the United States Bureau of Mines in the 1980s In 2006 Carnegie Mellon Trustee Jill Gansman Kraus donated the 80foot 24mtall sculpture Walking to the Sky which was placed on the lawn facing Forbes Ave between the Cohon University Center and Warner Hall The sculpture was controversial for its placement the general lack of input that the campus community had and its lack of aesthetic appeal 20 In April 2015 Carnegie Mellon University in collaboration with Jones Lang LaSalle announced the planning of a second office space structure alongside the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center an upscale and fullservice hotel and retail and dining development along Forbes Avenue This complex will connect to the Tepper Quadrangle the Heinz College the Tata Consultancy Services Building and the GatesHillman Center to create an innovation corridor on the university campus The effort is intended to continue to attract major corporate partnerships to create opportunities for research teaching and employment with students and faculty 21 A panoramic view of Carnegie Mellon Universitys Pittsburgh

Wean Hall and Doherty Hall Purnell Center and the Cohon University Center Also visible are The Fence and the Walking to the Sky sculpture Campus architecture and design edit The campus began to take shape in the BeauxArts architecture style of Henry Hornbostel a winner of the 1904 competition to design the original institution and later the founder of what is now the Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture There was little change to the campus between the first and second World War A 1938 master plan by Githens and Keally suggested acquisition of new land along Forbes Avenue but the plan was not fully implemented The period starting with the construction of the Hall of the Arts former Graduate School of Industrial Administration building 1952 and ending with Wean Hall 1971 saw the institutional change from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon University New facilities were needed to respond to the Universitys growing national reputation in artificial intelligence business robotics and the arts In addition an expanding student population resulted in a need for improved facilities for student life athletics and libraries The campus finally expanded to Forbes Avenue from its original land along Schenley Park A ravine long known as The Cut was gradually filled in to campus level joining the Mall as a major campus open space Hamerschlag Roberts and Scott Halls are three of the teaching facilities of the College of Engineering The buildings of this era reflect current attitudes toward architectural style The International Style with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure had been in vogue in urban settings since the 1930s It came late to the Carnegie campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among all institutions of higher education to abandon historical styles By the 1960s it was seen as a way to accomplish the needed expansion and at the same time give the campus a new image Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement but not in its form or materials During the 1970s and 1980s the tenure of University President Richard Cyert 19721990 witnessed a period of growth and development The research budget grew from roughly US12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than US110 million in the late 1980s The work of researchers in new fields like robotics and software engineering helped the university to build on its reputation One example of this approach was the introduction of the universitys Andrew computing network in the mid1980s This pioneering project which linked all computers and workstations on campus set the standard for educational computing and established Carnegie Mellon as a leader in the use of technology in education and research On April 24 1984 cmuedu Carnegie Mellons Internet domain became one of the first six edu domain names Present edit Wean Hall home of the worlds first internetenabled soda vending machine 22 In the 1990s and into the 2000s Carnegie Mellon solidified its status among American universities consistently ranking in the top 25 in the national US News World Report rankings and in the top 60 ranking 55th in 2013 amongst universities worldwide 23 24 Carnegie Mellon is distinct in its interdisciplinary approach to research and education Through the establishment of programs and centers that are outside the limitations of departments or colleges the university has established leadership in fields such as computational finance information systems cognitive sciences management arts management product design behavioral economics energy science and economics humancomputer interaction entertainment technology and decision science Within the past two decades the university has built a new university center Cohon University Center theater and drama building Purnell Center business school building Posner Hall student union and several dormitories Baker Hall was renovated in the early 2000s decade and new chemistry labs were established in Doherty Hall soon after Several computer science buildings such as Newell Simon Hall also were established renovated or renamed in the early 2000s decade The university has most recently completed building the Gates Hillman Complex and continues renovating historic academic and residence halls The Gates Hillman Complex which houses the School of Computer Science The Gates Hillman Complex opened for occupancy on August 11 2009 sits on a 56acre 23ha site on the universitys West Campus surrounded by Cyert Hall the Purnell Center for the Arts Doherty Hall NewellSimon Hall Smith Hall Hamburg Hall and the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center It contains 318 offices as well as labs computer clusters lecture halls classrooms and a 255seat auditorium The Gates Hillman Complex was made possible by a 20 million lead gift from the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation and an additional 10 million grant from the Henry L Hillman Foundation The Gates Hillman Complex and the Purnell Center for the Arts are connected by the Randy Pausch Memorial Footbridge 25 Cohon University Center which contains an indoor swimming pool bookstore student club facilities gym and cafeteria On April 15 1997 Jared L Cohon former dean of the Yale School of Forestry Environmental Studies was elected president by Carnegie Mellons Board of Trustees During Cohons presidency Carnegie Mellon continued its trajectory of innovation and growth His strategic plan aimed to leverage the Universitys strengths to benefit society in the areas of biotechnology and life sciences information and security technology environmental science and practices the fine arts and humanities and business and public policy In 2006 following negotiations between President Cohon and South Australian Premier Mike Rann CMU opened a campus of the Heinz College in the historic Torrens Building in Adelaide Australia President Cohons term ended on June 30 2013 after which he returned to the faculty at Carnegie Mellon On July 1 2003 Carnegie Mellon launched Inspre

Project distributed computing environment developed at Carnegie Mellon University beginning in 1982 It was an ambitious project for its time and resulted in an unprecedentedly vast and accessible university computing infrastructure The goal was to have connected 3M computer workstations 100 Artificial intelligence Several of the first AI software programs were created at Carnegie Mellon These include the Logic Theorist General Problem Solver and Soar Autonomous vehicle Navlab the first autonomous car program was developed by Carnegie Mellon Since then H1ghlander and Sandstorm autonomous vehicles were developed at Carnegie Mellon and placed 3rd and 2nd in the DARPA Grand Challenge and Carnegie Mellons Boss won the DARPA Grand Challenge 2007 101 The university continues to be a leader

systems programming language until C made its debut in 1972 102 Mach kernel Richard Rashid and Avie Tevanian developed Mach at Carnegie Mellon from 1985 to 1994 ending with Mach 30 which is a true microkernel Mach was developed as a replacement for the kernel in the BSD version of Unix so no new operating system would have to be designed around it Experimental research on Mach appears to have ended although Mach and its derivatives exist within a number of commercial operating systems These include NeXTSTEP and OpenStep upon which macOS and iOS are based 103 Wifi network Alex Hills created

Traditions edit Main article Carnegie Mellon University traditions The Fence The Fence In the early days of Carnegie Tech there was a single bridge which connected Margaret Morrison Womens College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology The bridge was a meeting place for students In 1916 the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place The students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fenceThe administration was about to give up and tear it down but that night a fraternity as a prank painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party Ever since painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition 118 The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus in the area known as the Cut Students guard the fence 24 hours a day and as long as two vigils are maintained no other student may take the fence The fence can then be painted by the group that has it but only between midnight and 6am Only hand brushes may be used the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine The previous paint cannot be stripped and each new painting adds a new layer The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1 of surrounding paint and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete Today the fence is considered the worlds most painted object by the Guinness Book of World Records citation needed Spring Carnival Usually held in April Spring Carnival is the biggest event of the school year In addition to classic carnival attractions the Spring Carnival features the Buggy Sweepstakes and Booth a competition between various organizations to build small elaborate booths based on a theme chosen each year Two pushers exchange the buggy for Kappa Delta Rho on the first hill of Sweepstakes Buggy Races Buggy officially called Sweepstakes is a race around Schenley Park It can be thought of as a relay race with five runners using the buggy vehicle as the baton Entrants submit a small usually torpedoshaped vehicle that is pushed uphill and then allowed to roll downhill The vehicles are unpowered including the prohibition of such energystoring devices as flywheels They are however steered by a driver who is usually a petite female student lying prone arms stretched forward to steer via a turning mechanism Space is so tight inside the buggies that the drivers usually cannot change position beyond turning their heads A Mobot competing in the annual Mobot challenge Mobot Mobot a portmanteau for mobile robot is an annual competition at Carnegie Mellon that made its debut in 1994 In this event robots try autonomously to pass through gates in order and reach the
