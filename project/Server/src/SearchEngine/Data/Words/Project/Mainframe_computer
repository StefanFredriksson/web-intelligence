Mainframe computer Mainframe redirects here For other uses see Mainframe disambiguation A pair of IBM mainframes On the left is the IBM z Systems z13 On the right is the IBM LinuxONE Rockhopper An IBM System z9 mainframe Mainframe computers or mainframes colloquially referred to as big iron 1 are computers used primarily by large organizations for critical applications bulk data processing such as census industry and consumer statistics enterprise resource planning and transaction processing They are larger and have more processing power than some other classes of computers minicomputers servers workstations and personal computers The term originally referred to the large cabinets called main frames that housed the central processing unit and main memory of early computers 2 3 Later the term was used to distinguish highend commercial machines from less powerful units 4 Most largescale computer system architectures were established in the 1960s but continue to evolve Mainframe computers are often used as servers Contents 1 Design 2 Characteristics 3 Current market 4 History 5 Differences from supercomputers 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References 9 External links Design edit Modern mainframe design is characterized less by raw computational speed and more by Redundant internal engineering resulting in high reliability and security Extensive inputoutput IO facilities with the ability to offload to separate engines Strict backward compatibility with older software High hardware and computational utilization rates through virtualization to support massive throughput Hotswapping of hardware such as processors and memory Their high stability and reliability enable these machines to run uninterrupted for very long periods of time with mean time between failures MTBF measured in decades Mainframes have high availability one of the primary reasons for their longevity since they are typically used in applications where downtime would be costly or catastrophic The term reliability availability and serviceability RAS is a defining characteristic of mainframe computers Proper planning and implementation is required to realize these features In addition mainframes are more secure than other computer types the NIST vulnerabilities database USCERT rates traditional mainframes such as IBM Z previously called z Systems System z and zSeries Unisys Dorado and Unisys Libra as among the most secure with vulnerabilities in the low single digits as compared with thousands for Windows UNIX and Linux 5 Software upgrades usually require setting up the operating system or portions thereof and are nondisruptive only when using virtualizing facilities such as IBM zOS and Parallel Sysplex or Unisys XPCL which support workload sharing so that one system can take over anothers application while it is being refreshed In the late 1950s mainframes had only a rudimentary interactive interface the console and used sets of punched cards paper tape or magnetic tape to transfer data and programs They operated in batch mode to support back office functions such as payroll and customer billing most of which were based on repeated tapebased sorting and merging operations followed by line printing to preprinted continuous stationery When interactive user terminals were introduced they were used almost exclusively for applications eg airline booking rather than program development Typewriter and Teletype devices were common control consoles for system operators through the early 1970s although ultimately supplanted by keyboard display devices By the early 1970s many mainframes acquired interactive user terminals NB 1 operating as timesharing computers supporting hundreds of users simultaneously along with batch processing Users gained access through keyboardtypewriter terminals and specialized text terminal CRT displays with integral keyboards or later from personal computers equipped with terminal emulation software By the 1980s many mainframes supported graphic display terminals and terminal emulation but not graphical user interfaces This form of enduser computing became obsolete in the 1990s due to the advent of personal computers provided with GUIs After 2000 modern mainframes partially or entirely phased out classic green screen and color display terminal access for endusers in favour of Webstyle user interfaces citation needed The infrastructure requirements were drastically reduced during the mid1990s when CMOS mainframe designs replaced the older bipolar technology IBM claimed that its newer mainframes reduced data center energy costs for power and cooling and reduced physical space requirements compared to server farms 6 Characteristics edit Inside an IBM System z9 mainframe Modern mainframes can run multiple different instances of operating systems at the same time This technique of virtual machines allows applications to run as if they were on physically distinct computers In this role a single mainframe can replace higherfunctioning hardware services available to conventional servers While mainframes pioneered this capability virtualization is now available on most families of computer systems though not always to the same degree or level of sophistication 7 Mainframes can add or hot swap system capacity without disrupting system function with specificity and granularity to a level of sophistication not usually available with most server solutions citation needed Modern mainframes notably the IBM zSeries System z9 and System z10 servers offer two levels of virtualization logical partitions LPARs via the PRSM facility and virtual machines via the zVM operating system Many mainframe customers run two machines one in their primary data center and one in their backup data center fully active partially active or on standbyin case there is a catastrophe affecting the first building Test development training and production workload for applications and databases can run on a single machine except for extremely large demands where the capacity of one machine might be limiting Such a twomainframe installation can support continuous business service avoiding both planned and unplanned outages In practice many customers use multiple mainframes linked either by Parallel Sysplex and shared DASD in IBMs case citation needed or with shared geographically dispersed storage provided by EMC or Hitachi Mainframes are designed to handle very high volume input and output IO and emphasize throughput computing Since the late1950s NB 2 mainframe designs have included subsidiary hardware NB 3 called channels or peripheral processors which manage the IO devices leaving the CPU free to deal only with highspeed memory It is common in mainframe shops to deal with massive databases and files Gigabyte to terabyte size record files are not unusual 8 Compared to a typical PC mainframes commonly have hundreds to thousands of times as much data storage online 9 and can access it reasonably quickly Other server families also offload IO processing and emphasize throughput computing Mainframe return on investment ROI like any other computing platform is dependent on its ability to scale support mixed workloads reduce labor costs deliver uninterrupted service for critical business applications and several other riskadjusted cost factors Mainframes also have execution integrity characteristics for fault tolerant computing For example z900 z990 System z9 and System z10 servers effectively execute resultoriented instructions twice compare results arbitrate between any differences through instruction retry and failure isolation then shift workloads in flight to functioning processors including spares without any impact to operating systems applications or users This hardwarelevel feature also found in HPs NonStop systems is known as lockstepping because both processors take their steps ie instructions together Not all applications absolutely need the assured integrity that these systems provide but many do such as financial transaction processing citation needed Current market edit IBM with z Systems continues to be a major manufacturer in the mainframe market Unisys manufactures ClearPath Libra mainframes based on earlier Burroughs MCP products and ClearPath Dorado mainframes based on Sperry Univac OS 1100 product lines In 2000 Hitachi codeveloped the zSeries z900 with IBM to share expenses but subsequently the two companies have not collaborated on new Hitachi models HewlettPackard sells its unique NonStop systems which it acquired with Tandem Computers and which some analysts classify as mainframes Groupe Bull s GCOS Fujitsu formerly Siemens BS2000 and Fujitsu ICL VME mainframes are still available in Europe and Fujitsu formerly Amdahl GS21 mainframes globally NEC with ACOS and Hitachi with AP10000VOS3 10 still maintain mainframe hardware businesses in the Japanese market The amount of vendor investment in mainframe development varies with market share Fujitsu and Hitachi both continue to use custom S390compatible processors as well as other CPUs including POWER and Xeon for lowerend systems Bull uses a mixture of Itanium and Xeon processors NEC uses Xeon processors for its lowend ACOS2 line but develops the custom NOAH6 processor for its highend ACOS4 series IBM also develops custom processors inhouse such as the zEC12 Unisys produces code compatible mainframe systems that range from laptops to cabinetsized mainframes that utilize homegrown CPUs as well as Xeon processors Furthermore there exists a market for software applications to manage the performance of mainframe implementations In addition to IBM significant players in this market include BMC 11 Compuware 12 13 and CA Technologies 14

produced mainframe computers from the late 1950s until the early 21st Century with gradually decreasing numbers and a gradual transition to simulation on Intel chips rather than proprietary hardware The US group of manufacturers was first known as IBM and the Seven Dwarfs 15 p83 usually Burroughs UNIVAC NCR Control Data Honeywell General Electric and RCA although some lists varied Later with the departure of General Electric and RCA it was referred to as IBM and the BUNCH IBMs dominance grew out of their 7007000 series and later the development of the 360 series mainframes The latter architecture has continued to evolve into their current zSeries mainframes which along with the then Burroughs and Sperry now Unisys MCP based and OS1100 mainframes are among the few mainframe architectures still extant that can trace their roots to this early period While IBMs zSeries can still run 24bit System360 code the 64bit zSeries and System z9 CMOS servers have nothing physically in common with the older systems Notable manufacturers outside the US were Siemens and Telefunken in Germany ICL in the United Kingdom Olivetti in Italy and Fujitsu Hitachi Oki and NEC in Japan The Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries manufactured close copies of IBM mainframes during the Cold War the BESM series and Strela are examples of an independently designed Soviet computer Shrinking demand and tough competition started a shakeout in the market in the early 1970sRCA sold out to UNIVAC and GE sold its business to Honeywell between 1986 and 1990 Honeywell was bought out by Bull UNIVAC became a division of Sperry which later merged with Burroughs to form Unisys Corporation in 1986 During the 1980s minicomputer based systems grew more sophisticated and were able to displace the lowerend of the mainframes These computers sometimes called departmental computers were typified by the DEC VAX In 1991 ATT Corporation briefly owned NCR During the same period companies found that servers based on microcomputer designs could be deployed at a fraction of the acquisition price and offer local users much greater control over their own systems given the IT policies and practices at that time Terminals used for interacting with mainframe systems were gradually replaced by personal computers Consequently demand plummeted and new mainframe installations were restricted mainly to financial services and government In the early 1990s there was a rough consensus among industry analysts that the mainframe was a dying market as mainframe platforms were increasingly replaced by personal computer networks InfoWorld s Stewart Alsop infamously predicted that the last mainframe would be unplugged in 1996 in 1993 he cited Cheryl Currid a computer industry analyst as saying that the last mainframe will stop working on December 31 1999 16 a reference to the anticipated Year 2000 problem Y2K That trend started to turn around in the late 1990s as corporations found new uses for their existing mainframes and as the price of data networking collapsed in most parts of the world encouraging trends toward more centralized computing The growth of ebusiness also dramatically increased the number of backend transactions processed by mainframe software as well as the size and throughput of databases Batch processing such as billing became even more important and larger with the growth of ebusiness and mainframes are particularly adept at largescale batch computing Another factor currently increasing mainframe use is the development of the Linux operating system which arrived on IBM mainframe systems in 1999 and is typically run in scores or up to 8000 virtual machines on a single mainframe Linux allows users to take advantage of open source software combined with mainframe hardware RAS Rapid expansion and development in emerging markets particularly Peoples Republic of China is also spurring major mainframe investments to solve exceptionally difficult computing problems eg providing unified extremely high volume online transaction processing databases for 1 billion consumers across multiple industries banking insurance credit reporting government services etc In late 2000 IBM introduced 64bit zArchitecture acquired numerous software companies such as Cognos and introduced those software products to the mainframe IBMs quarterly and annual reports in the 2000s usually reported increasing mainframe revenues and capacity shipments However IBMs mainframe hardware business has not been immune to the recent overall downturn in the server hardware market or to model cycle effects For example in the 4th quarter of 2009 IBMs System z hardware revenues decreased by 27 year over year But MIPS millions of instructions per second shipments increased 4 per year over the past two years 17 Alsop had himself photographed in 2000 symbolically eating his own words death of the mainframe 18 In 2012 NASA powered down its last mainframe an IBM System z9 19 However IBMs successor to the z9 the z10 led a New York Times reporter to state four years earlier that mainframe technology hardware software and services remains a large and lucrative business for IBM and mainframes are still the backoffice engines behind the worlds financial markets and much of global commerce 20 As of 2010 update while mainframe technology represented less than 3 of IBMs revenues it continued to play an outsized role in Big Blues results 21 In 2015 IBM launched the IBM z13 22 in June 2017 the IBM z14 23 24 and in September 2019 IBM launched the latest version of the product the IBM z15 25 Differences from supercomputers edit A supercomputer is a computer at the leading edge of data processing capability with respect to calculation speed Supercomputers are used for scientific and engineering problems highperformance computing which crunch numbers and data 26 while mainframes focus on transaction processing The differences are Mainframes are built to be reliable for transaction processing measured by TPC metrics not used or helpful for most supercomputing applications as it is commonly understood in the business world the commercial exchange of goods services or money citation needed A typical transaction as defined by the Transaction Processing Performance Council 27 updates a database system for inventory control goods airline reservations services or banking money by adding a record A transaction may refer to a set of operations including disk readwrites operating system calls or some form of data transfer from one subsystem to another which is not measured by the processing speed of the CPU Transaction processing is not exclusive to mainframes but is also used by microprocessorbased servers and online networks Supercomputer performance is measured in floating point operations per second FLOPS 28 or in traversed edges per second or TEPS 29 metrics that are not very meaningful for mainframe applications while mainframes are sometimes measured in millions of instructions per second MIPS although the definition depends on the instruction mix measured 30 Examples of integer operations measured by MIPS include adding numbers together checking values or moving data around in memory while moving information to and from storage socalled IO is most helpful for mainframes and within memory only helping indirectly Floating point operations are mostly addition subtraction and multiplication of binary floating point in supercomputers measured by FLOPS with enough digits of precision to model continuous phenomena such as weather prediction and nuclear simulations only recently standardized decimal floating point not used in supercomputers are appropriate for monetary values such as those useful for mainframe applications In terms of computational speed supercomputers are more powerful 31 Mainframes and supercomputers cannot always be clearly distinguished up until the early 1990s many supercomputers were based on a mainframe architecture with supercomputing extensions An example of such a system is the HITAC S3800 which was instructionset compatible with IBM System370 mainframes and could run the Hitachi VOS3 operating system a fork of IBM MVS 32 The S3800 therefore can be seen as being both simultaneously a supercomputer and also an IBMcompatible mainframe In 2007 33 an amalgamation of the different technologies and architectures for supercomputers and mainframes has led to the socalled gameframe See also edit Computer types Failover Gameframe Channel IO Cloud computing Notes edit Some had been introduced in the 1960s but their deployment became more common in the 1970s Eg the IBM 709 had channels in 1958 sometimes computers sometimes more
