Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT is a private research university in Cambridge Massachusetts The Institute is a landgrant seagrant and spacegrant university with an urban campus that extends more than a mile 16km alongside the Charles River The Institute also encompasses a number of major offcampus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory the Bates Center and the Haystack Observatory as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering It has since played a key role in the development of many aspects of modern science engineering mathematics and technology and is widely known for its innovation and academic strength making it one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the world 11 12 13 14 As of October2019 update 96 Nobel

Allen leftright inverted Original Rogers Building Back Bay Boston 19th century In 1859 a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands in Back Bay Boston for a Conservatory of Art and Science but the proposal failed 23 24 A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology proposed by William Barton Rogers was signed by John Albion Andrew the governor of Massachusetts on April 10 1861 25 Rogers a professor from the University of Virginia wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances 26 27 He did not wish to found a professional school but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education 28 proposing that The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is as I conceive the teaching not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts which can be done only in the workshop but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them and along with this a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws 29 The Rogers Plan reflected the German research university model emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories 30 31 Early developments edit A 1905 map of MITs Boston campus The thennew Cambridge campus completed in 1916 The Harvard Bridge named after John Harvard but otherwise unrelated to Harvard University is in the foreground connecting Boston to Cambridge Two days after MIT was chartered the first battle of the Civil War broke out After a long delay through the war years MITs first classes were held in the Mercantile Building in Boston in 1865 32 The new institute was founded as part of the Morrill LandGrant Colleges Act to fund institutions to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes and was a landgrant school 33 34 In 1863 under the same act the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded the Massachusetts Agricultural College which developed as the University of Massachusetts Amherst In 1866 the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the Back Bay 35 MIT was informally called Boston Tech 35 The institute adopted the European polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date 30 Despite chronic financial problems the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under President Francis Amasa Walker 36 Programs in electrical chemical marine and sanitary engineering were introduced 37 38 new buildings were built and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand 36 The curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis with less focus on theoretical science 39 The fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the MIT leadership During these Boston Tech years MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president and former MIT faculty Charles W Eliot s repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard Colleges Lawrence Scientific School 40 There would be at least six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard 41 In its cramped Back Bay location MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding Eventually the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard over the vehement objections of MIT faculty students and alumni 41 However a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively put an end to the merger scheme 41 Plaque in Building 6 honoring George Eastman founder of Eastman Kodak who was revealed as the anonymous Mr Smith who helped maintain MITs independence In 1916 the MIT administration and the MIT charter crossed the Charles River on the ceremonial barge Bucentaur built for the occasion 42 43 to signify MITs move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of filled land on a onemilelong 16km tract along the Cambridge side of the Charles River 44 45 The neoclassical New Technology campus was designed by William W Bosworth 46 and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious Mr Smith starting in 1912 In January 1920 the donor was revealed to be the industrialist George Eastman of Rochester New York who had invented methods of film production and processing and founded Eastman Kodak Between 1912 and 1920 Eastman donated 20 million 2366 million in 2015 dollars in cash and Kodak stock to MIT 47 In 1931 Stanislav Shumovsky enrolled He later communicated much technical information on aviation to the Soviet Union Other MIT spies sent other secrets about American technology eventually including atomic bomb secrets 48 Curricular reforms edit In the 1930s President Karl Taylor Compton and VicePresident effectively Provost Vannevar Bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios 49 The Compton reforms renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering 50 Unlike Ivy League schools MIT catered more to middleclass families and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants for its funding 51 The school was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934 52 Still as late as 1949 the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at MIT that the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school a partly unjustified perception the committee sought to change The report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum recommended offering a broader education and warned against letting engineering and governmentsponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities 53 54 The School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences and the MIT Sloan School of Management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of Science and Engineering Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics management political science and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs 55 56 The School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents Howard W Johnson and Jerome Wiesner between 1966 and 1980 57 Defense research edit ROTC students at MIT in 2019 MITs involvement in military science surged during World War II In 1941 Vannevar Bush was appointed head of the federal Office of Scientific Research and Development and directed funding to only a select group of universities including MIT 58 Engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at MITs Radiation Laboratory established in 1940 to assist the British military in developing microwave radar The work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area 59 Other defense projects included gyroscope based and other complex control systems for gunsight bombsight and inertial navigation under Charles Stark Draper s Instrumentation Laboratory 60 61 the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under Project Whirlwind 62 and highspeed and highaltitude photography under Harold Edgerton 63 64 By the end of the war MIT became the nations largest wartime RD contractor attracting some criticism of Bush 58 employing nearly 4000 in the Radiation Laboratory alone 59 and receiving in excess of 100 million 12 billion in 2015 dollars before 1946 50 Work on defense projects continued even after then Postwar governmentsponsored research at MIT included SAGE and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and Project Apollo 65 a special type of educational institution which can be defined as a university polarized around science engineering and the arts We might call it a university limited in its objectives but unlimited in the breadth and the thoroughness with which it pursues these objectives MIT president James Rhyne Killian These activities affected MIT profoundly A 1949 report noted the lack of any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute to match the return to peacetime remembering the academic tranquility of the prewar years though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities 66 The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of Karl Taylor Compton president of MIT between 1930 and 1948 James Rhyne Killian president from 1948 to 1957 and Julius Adams Stratton chancellor from 1952 to 1957 whose institutionbuilding strategies shaped the expanding university By the 1950s MIT no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons philanthropic foundations and the federal government 67 In late 1960s and early 1970s student and faculty activists protested against the Vietnam War and MITs defense research 68 69 In this period MITs various departments were researching helicopters smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles 70 The Union of Concerned Scientists was founded on March 4 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems 71 MIT ultimately divested itself from the Instrumentation Laboratory and moved all classified research offcampus to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests 72 73 The student body faculty and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities 68 Johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to greater strength and unity after these times of turmoil 74 However six MIT students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders such as Michael Albert and George Katsiaficas are still indignant about MITs role in military research and its suppression of these protests 75 Richard Leacock s film November Actions records some of these tumultuous events 76 In the 1980s there was more controversy at MIT over its involvement in SDI space weaponry and CBW chemical and biological warfare research 77 More recently MITs research for the military has included work on robots drones and battle suits 78 Recent history edit The MIT Media Lab houses researchers developing novel uses of computer technology and shown here is the 1982 building designed by IM Pei with an extension right of photo designed by Fumihiko Maki opened in March 2010 MIT has kept pace with and helped to advance the digital age In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies 79 80 students staff and faculty members at Project MAC the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like Spacewar and created much of modern hacker slang and culture 81 Several major computerrelated organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s Richard Stallman s GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid1980s at the AI Lab the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology 82 the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim BernersLee 83 the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002 84 and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005 85 MIT was named a seagrant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a spacegrant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs 86 87 Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century MIT launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus the Tang Center for Management Education several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology brain and cognitive sciences genomics biotechnology and cancer research and a number of new backlot buildings on Vassar Street including the Stata Center 88 Construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the Media Lab the Sloan Schools eastern campus and graduate residences in the northwest 89 90 In 2006 President Hockfield launched the MIT Energy Research Council to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing global energy consumption 91 In 2001 inspired by the open source and open access movements 92 MIT launched OpenCourseWare to make the lecture notes problem sets syllabi exams and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed 93 While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high 94 OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the OpenCourseWare Consortium which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages 95 In 2011 MIT announced it would offer formal certification but not credits or degrees to online participants completing coursework in its MITx program for a modest fee 96 The edX online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with Harvard and its analogous Harvardx initiative The courseware platform is open source and other universities have already joined and added their own course content 97 In March 2009 the MIT faculty adopted an openaccess policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online 98 MIT has its own police force Three days after the Boston Marathon bombing of April 2013 MIT Police patrol officer Sean Collier was fatally shot by the suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the Boston metropolitan area for a day 99 One week later Colliers memorial service was attended by more than 10000 people in a ceremony hosted by the MIT community with thousands of police officers from the New England region and Canada 100 101 102 On November 25 2013 MIT announced the creation of the Collier Medal to be awarded annually to an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that Officer Collier exhibited as a member of the MIT community and in all aspects of his life The announcement further stated that Future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession those who have contributed to building bridges across the community and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness 103 104 105 In September 2017 the school announced the creation of an artificial intelligence research lab called the MITIBM Watson AI Lab IBM will spend 240 million over the next decade and the lab will be staffed by MIT and IBM scientists 106 In October 2018 MIT announced that in September 2019 it would open a new College of Computing dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence to be named after lead donor and The Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman The focus of the new college is to study not just AI but interdisciplinary AI education and how AI can be used in fields as diverse as history and biology The cost of buildings and new faculty for the new college is expected to be 1 billion upon completion 107 Over the course of 20 years MIT received approximately 800000 via foundations controlled by Jeffrey Epstein 108 convicted sex offender charged with the sex trafficking and sexual abuse of minors All of those gifts went either to the MIT Media Lab or to Professor Seth Lloyd Both Lloyd and former Media Lab Director Joi Ito have made public statements apologizing to Jeffrey Epsteins victims and others for judgments made over a series of years 109 110 Ito resigned from his position as Media Lab Director and professor but Lloyd did not 111 112 Campus edit Main article Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology The central and eastern sections of MITs campus as seen from above Massachusetts Avenue and the Charles River Left of center is the Great Dome overlooking Killian Court with Kendall Square to the upper right MITs Building 10 and Great Dome overlooking Killian Court MITs 166acre 672ha campus in the city of Cambridge spans approximately a mile along the north side of the Charles River basin 6 The campus is divided roughly in half by Massachusetts Avenue with most dormitories and student life facilities to the west and most academic buildings to the east The bridge closest to MIT is the Harvard Bridge which is known for being marked off in a nonstandard unit of length the smoot 113 114 The KendallMIT MBTA Red Line station is located on the northeastern edge of the campus in Kendall Square The Cambridge neighborhoods surrounding MIT are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings as well as socioeconomically diverse residential neighborhoods 115 116 In early 2016 MIT presented its updated Kendall Square Initiative to the City of Cambridge with plans for mixeduse educational retail residential startup incubator and office space in a dense highrise transitoriented development plan 117 118 The MIT Museum will eventually be moved immediately adjacent to a Kendall Square subway entrance joining the List Visual Arts Center on the eastern end of the campus 118 119 Each building at MIT has a number possibly preceded by a W N E or NW designation and most have a name as well Typically academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name The organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which the buildings were built and their location relative north west and east to the original center cluster of Maclaurin buildings 120 Many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of tunnels providing protection from the Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking 121 122 MITs oncampus nuclear reactor 123 is one of the most powerful universitybased nuclear reactors in the United States The prominence of the reactors containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial 124 but MIT maintains that it is wellsecured 125 In 1999 Bill Gates donated US20 million to MIT for the construction of a computer laboratory named the William H Gates Building and designed by architect Frank Gehry While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution this was the first personal donation received from Gates 126 MIT Nano also known as Building 12 is an interdisciplinary facility for nanoscale research Its 100000 square feet cleanroom and research space visible through expansive glass facades is the largest research facility of its kind in the nation 127 With a cost of US400 million it is also one of the costliest buildings on campus The facility also provides stateoftheart nanoimaging capabilities with vibration damped imaging and metrology suites sitting atop a 5millionpound slab of concrete underground 128 Other notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel for testing aerodynamic research a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs and Alcator CMod the largest fusion device operated by any university 129 130 MITs campuswide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3000 access points covering 9400000 square feet 870000m 2 of campus 131 In 2001 the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT for violating the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its hazardous waste storage and disposal procedures 132 MIT settled the suit by paying a 155000 fine and launching three environmental projects 133 In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles subsidizing public transportation passes and building a lowemission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity heating and cooling requirements 134 The MIT Police with state and local authorities in the 20092011 period have investigated reports of 12 forcible sex offenses 6 robberies 3 aggravated assaults 164 burglaries 1 case of arson and 4 cases of motor vehicle theft on campus affecting a community of around 22000 students and employees MIT has substantial commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge on which it pays property taxes plus an additional voluntary payment in lieu of taxes PILOT on academic buildings which are legally taxexempt As of 2017 update it is the largest taxpayer in the city contributing approximately 14 of the citys annual revenues 135 Holdings include Technology Square parts of Kendall Square and many properties in Cambridgeport and Area 4 neighboring the educational buildings 136 The land is held for investment purposes and potential longterm expansion Architecture edit The Stata Center houses CSAIL LIDS and the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy MITs School of Architecture now the School of Architecture and Planning was the first in the United States 137 and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings 138 139 The first buildings constructed on the Cambridge campus completed in 1916 are sometimes called the Maclaurin buildings after Institute president Richard Maclaurin who oversaw their construction Designed by William Welles Bosworth these imposing buildings were built of reinforced concrete a first for a nonindustrial much less university building in the US 140 Bosworths design was influenced by the City Beautiful Movement of the early 1900s 140 and features the Pantheon esque Great Dome housing the Barker Engineering Library The Great Dome overlooks Killian Court where graduation ceremonies are held each year The friezes of the limestoneclad buildings around Killian Court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophers a The spacious Building 7 atrium at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the entrance to the Infinite Corridor and the rest of the campus 116 Alvar Aalto s Baker House 1947 Eero Saarinen s MIT Chapel and Kresge Auditorium 1955 and IM Pei s Green Dreyfus Landau and Wiesner buildings represent high forms of postwar modernist architecture 143 144 145 More recent buildings like Frank Gehry s Stata Center 2004 Steven Holl s Simmons Hall 2002 Charles Correa s Building 46 2005 and Fumihiko Maki s Media Lab Extension 2009 stand out among the Boston areas classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus starchitecture 138 146 These buildings have not always been well received 147 148 in 2010 The Princeton Review included MIT in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are tiny unsightly or both 149 Housing edit Main article Housing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology The Simmons Hall undergrad dormitory was completed in 2002 Undergraduates are guaranteed fouryear housing in one of MITs 10 undergraduate dormitories 150 Those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from livein graduate student tutors resident advisors and faculty housemasters 151 Because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the students themselves diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups for example according to the Yale Daily News staffs The Insiders Guide to the Colleges 2010 The split between East Campus and West Campus is a significant characteristic of MIT East Campus has gained a reputation as a thriving counterculture 152 MIT also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families 153 MIT has an active Greek and coop housing system including thirtysix fraternities sororities and independent living groups FSILGs 154 As of 2015 update 98 of all undergraduates lived in MITaffiliated housing 54 of the men participated in fraternities and 20 of the women were involved in sororities 155 Most FSILGs are located across the river in Back Bay near where MIT was founded and there is also a cluster of fraternities on MITs West Campus that face the Charles River Basin 156 After the 1997 alcoholrelated death of Scott Krueger a new pledge at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity MIT required all freshmen to live in the dormitory system starting in 2002 157 Because FSILGs had previously housed as many as 300 freshmen offcampus the new policy could not be implemented until Simmons Hall opened in that year 158 In 20132014 MIT abruptly closed and then demolished undergrad dorm Bexley Hall citing extensive water damage that made repairs infeasible In 2017 MIT shut down Senior House after a century of service as an undergrad dorm That year MIT administrators released data showing just 60 of Senior House residents had graduated in four years Campuswide the fouryear graduation rate is 84 the cumulative graduation rate is significantly higher 159 Organization and administration edit Lobby 7 at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the main entrance to campus MIT is chartered as a nonprofit organization and is owned and governed by a privately appointed board of trustees known as the MIT Corporation 160 The current board consists of 43 members elected to fiveyear terms 161 25 life members who vote until their 75th birthday 162 3 elected officers President Treasurer and Secretary 163 and 4 ex officio members the president of the alumni association the Governor of Massachusetts the Massachusetts Secretary of Education and the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court 164 165 The board is chaired by Robert Millard a cofounder of L3 Communications Holdings 166 167 The Corporation approves the budget new programs degrees and faculty appointments and elects the President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and preside over the Institutes faculty 116 168 MITs endowment and other financial assets are managed through a subsidiary called MIT Investment Management Company MITIMCo 169 Valued at 164 billion in 2018 MITs endowment was then the sixthlargest among American colleges and universities 170 MIT has five schools Science Engineering Architecture and Planning Management and Humanities Arts and Social Sciences and one college Whitaker College of Health Sciences and Technology but no schools of law or medicine 171 b A second college The Stephen A Schwarzman College of Computing is scheduled to open in September 2019 173 While faculty committees assert substantial control over many areas of MITs curriculum research student life and administrative affairs 174 the chair of each of MITs 32 academic departments reports to the dean of that departments school who in turn reports to the Provost under the President 175 The current president is L Rafael Reif who formerly served as provost under President Susan Hockfield the first woman to hold the post 176 177 Academics edit MIT is a large highly residential research university with a majority of enrollments in graduate and professional programs 178 The university has been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 1929 179 MIT operates on a 414 academic calendar with the fall semester beginning after Labor Day and ending in midDecember a 4week Independent Activities Period in the month of January and the spring semester commencing in early February and ceasing in late May 180 MIT students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone 181 Departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order of their foundation for example Civil and Environmental Engineering is Course 1 while Linguistics and Philosophy is Course 24 182 Students majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science EECS the most popular department collectively identify themselves as Course 6 MIT students use a combination of the departments course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects for instance the introductory calculusbased classical mechanics course is simply 801 at MIT 183 c Undergraduate program edit The fouryear fulltime undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences and has been dubbed most selective by US News 186 admitting few transfer students 178 and 67 of its applicants in the 20172018 admissions cycle 187 MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools 188 In the 20172018 academic year 1045 bachelor of science degrees abbreviated SB were granted the only type of undergraduate degree MIT now awards needs update 189 190 In the 2011 fall term among students who had designated a major the School of Engineering was the most popular division enrolling 63 of students in its 19 degree programs followed by the School of Science 29 School of Humanities Arts Social Sciences 37 Sloan School of Management 33 and School of Architecture and Planning 2 needs update The largest undergraduate degree programs were in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Course 62 Computer Science and Engineering Course 63 Mechanical Engineering Course 2 Physics Course 8 and Mathematics Course 18 184 The Infinite Corridor is the primary passageway through campus All undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements GIRs 191 The Science Requirement generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors comprises two semesters of physics two semesters of calculus one semester of chemistry and one semester of biology There is a Laboratory Requirement usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major The Humanities Arts and Social Sciences HASS Requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities arts and social sciences including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a HASS division Under the Communication Requirement two of the HASS classes plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be communicationintensive 192 including substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation 193 Finally all students are required to complete a swimming test 194 nonvarsity athletes must also take four quarters of physical education classes 191 Most classes rely on a combination of lectures recitations led by associate professors or graduate students weekly problem sets psets and periodic quizzes or tests While the pace and difficulty of MIT coursework has been compared to drinking from a fire hose 195 196 197 the freshmen retention rate at MIT is similar to other research universities 186 The passnorecord grading system relieves some pressure for firstyear undergraduates For each class taken in the fall term freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed or otherwise not have any record of it In the spring term passing grades A B C appear on the transcript while nonpassing grades are again not recorded 198 Grading had previously been passno record all freshman year but was amended for the Class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes in their freshman year 199 Also freshmen may choose to join alternative learning communities such as Experimental Study Group Concourse or Terrascope 198 In 1969 Margaret MacVicar founded the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program UROP to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers Students join or initiate research projects UROPs for academic credit pay or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly 200 A substantial majority of undergraduates participate 201 202 Students often become published file patent applications andor launch startup companies based upon their experience in UROPs 203 204 In 1970 the thenDean of Institute Relations Benson R Snyder published The Hidden Curriculum arguing that education at MIT was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education The successful student according to Snyder was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms For example organized student groups had compiled course bibles collections of problemset and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references This sort of gamesmanship Snyder argued hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest 205 206 Graduate program edit MITs graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels MIT offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities social sciences and STEM fields as well as professional degrees 178 The Institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the Master of Science which is abbreviated as SM at MIT various

1980s and early 1990s American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayerfunded research and technology to international especially Japanese firms that were competing with struggling American businesses 238 239 On the other hand MITs extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940 e MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy 241 242 The US Justice Department began an investigation in 1989 and in 1991 filed an antitrust suit against MIT the eight Ivy League colleges and eleven other institutions for allegedly engaging in pricefixing during their annual Overlap Meetings which were held to prevent bidding wars over promising prospective students from consuming funds for needbased scholarships 243 244 While the Ivy League institutions settled 245 MIT contested the charges arguing that the practice was not anticompetitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students 246 247 MIT ultimately prevailed when the Justice Department dropped the case in 1994 248 249 Walker Memorial is a monument to MITs fourth president Francis Amasa Walker MIT main campus seen
