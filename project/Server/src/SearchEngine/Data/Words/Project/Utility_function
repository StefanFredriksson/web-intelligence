the concept of utility is used to model worth or value Its usage has evolved significantly over time The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or satisfaction within the theory of utilitarianism by moral philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill The term has been adapted and reapplied within neoclassical economics which dominates modern economic theory as a utility function that represents a consumers preference ordering over a choice set It is devoid of its original interpretation as a measurement of the pleasure or satisfaction obtained by the consumer from that choice Contents 1 Utility function 2 Applications 3 Revealed preference 4 Functions 41 Cardinal 42 Ordinal 43 Preferences 44 Revealed preferences in finance 45 Examples 5 Expected utility 51

set of alternatives facing an individual and over which the individual has a preference ordering A utility function is able to represent those preferences if it is possible to assign a real number to each alternative in such a way that alternative a is assigned a number greater than alternative b if and only if the individual prefers alternative a to alternative b In this situation an individual that selects the most preferred alternative available is necessarily also selecting the alternative that maximises the associated utility function In general economic terms a utility function measures preferences concerning a set of goods and services Often utility is correlated with words such as happiness satisfaction and welfare and these are hard to measure mathematically Thus economists utilize consumption baskets of preferences in order to measure these abstract non quantifiable ideas Gérard Debreu precisely defined the conditions required for a preference ordering to be representable by a utility function 1 For a finite set of alternatives these require only that the preference ordering is complete so the individual is able to determine which of any two alternatives is preferred or that they are equally preferred and that the preference order is transitive Applications edit Utility is usually applied by economists in such constructs as the indifference curve which plot the combination of commodities that an individual or a society would accept to maintain a given level of satisfaction Utility and indifference curves are used by economists to understand the underpinnings of demand curves which are half of the supply and demand analysis that is used to analyze the workings of goods markets Individual utility and social utility can be construed as the value of a utility function and a social welfare function respectively When coupled with production or commodity constraints under some assumptions these functions can be used to analyze Pareto efficiency such as illustrated by Edgeworth boxes in contract curves Such efficiency is a central concept in welfare economics In finance utility is applied to generate an individuals price for an asset called the indifference price Utility functions are also related to risk measures with the most common example being the entropic risk measure In the field of artificial intelligence utility functions are used to convey the value of various outcomes to intelligent agents This allows the agents to plan actions with the goal of maximizing the utility or value of available choices Revealed preference edit It was recognized that utility could not be measured or observed directly so instead economists devised a way to infer underlying relative utilities from observed choice These revealed preferences as they were named by Paul Samuelson were revealed eg in peoples willingness to pay Utility is taken to be correlative to Desire or Want It has been already argued that desires cannot be measured directly but only indirectly by the outward phenomena to which they give rise and that in those cases with which economics is chiefly concerned the measure is found in the price which a person is willing to pay for the fulfillment or satisfaction of his desire 2 78 Functions edit There has been some controversy over the question whether the utility of a commodity can be measured or not At one time it was assumed that the consumer was able to say exactly how much utility he got from the commodity The economists who made this assumption belonged to the cardinalist school of economics Today utility functions expressing utility as a function of the amounts of the various goods consumed are treated as either cardinal or ordinal depending on whether they are or are not interpreted as providing more information than simply the rank ordering of preferences over bundles of goods such as information on the strength of preferences Cardinal edit Main article Cardinal utility When cardinal utility is used the magnitude of utility differences is treated as an ethically or behaviorally significant quantity For example suppose a cup of orange juice has utility of 120 utils a cup of tea has a utility of 80 utils and a cup of water has a utility of 40 utils With cardinal utility it can be concluded that the cup of orange juice is better than the cup of tea by exactly the same amount by which the cup of tea is better than the cup of water Formally speaking this means that if one has a cup of tea she would be willing to take any bet with a probability p greater than 5 of getting a cup of juice with a risk of getting a cup of water equal to 1p One cannot conclude however that the cup of tea is two thirds of the goodness of the cup of juice because this conclusion would depend not only on magnitudes of utility differences but also on the zero of utility For example if the zero of utility was located at 40 then a cup of orange juice would be 160 utils more than zero a cup of tea 120 utils more than zero Cardinal utility to economics can be seen as the assumption that utility can be measured through quantifiable characteristics such as height weight temperature etc Neoclassical economics has largely retreated from using cardinal utility functions as the basis of economic behavior A notable exception is in the context of analyzing choice under conditions of risk see below Sometimes cardinal utility is used to aggregate utilities across persons to create a social welfare function Ordinal edit Main article Ordinal utility When ordinal utilities are used differences in utils values taken on by the utility function are treated as ethically or behaviorally meaningless the utility index encodes a full behavioral ordering between members of a choice set but tells nothing about the related strength of preferences In the above example it would only be possible to say that juice is preferred to tea to water but no more Thus ordinal utility utilizes comparisons such as preferred to no more less than etc Ordinal utility functions are unique up to increasing monotone or monotonic transformations For example if a function u x displaystyle ux is taken as ordinal it is equivalent to the function u x 3 displaystyle ux3 because taking the 3rd power is an increasing monotone transformation or monotonic transformation This means that the ordinal preference induced by these functions is the same although they are two different functions In contrast cardinal utilities are unique only up to increasing linear transformations so if u x displaystyle ux is taken as cardinal it is not equivalent to u x 3 displaystyle ux3 Preferences edit Although preferences are the conventional foundation of microeconomics it is often convenient to represent preferences with a utility function and analyze human behavior indirectly with utility functions Let X be the consumption set the set of all mutuallyexclusive baskets the consumer could conceivably consume The consumers utility function u X R displaystyle ucolon Xto mathbb R ranks each package in the consumption set If the consumer strictly prefers x to y or is indifferent between them then u x u y displaystyle uxgeq uy For example suppose a consumers consumption set is X nothing 1apple1orange 1apple and 1orange 2apples 2oranges and its utility function is u nothing0 u 1apple1 u 1orange2 u 1apple and 1orange4 u 2apples2 and u 2oranges3 Then this consumer prefers 1 orange to 1 apple but prefers one of each to 2 oranges In microeconomic models there are usually a finite set of L commodities and a consumer may consume an arbitrary amount of each commodity This gives a consumption set of R L displaystyle mathbb R L and each package x R L displaystyle xin mathbb R L is a vector containing the amounts of each commodity In the previous example we might say there are two commodities apples and oranges If we say apples is the first commodity and oranges the second then the consumption set X R 2 displaystyle Xmathbb R 2 and u 000 u 101 u 012 u 114 u 202 u 023 as before Note that for u to be a utility function on X it must be defined for every package in X A utility function u X R displaystyle ucolon Xto mathbb R represents a preference relation displaystyle preceq on X iff for every x y X displaystyle xyin X u x u y displaystyle uxleq uy implies x y displaystyle xpreceq y If u represents displaystyle preceq then this implies displaystyle preceq is complete and transitive and hence rational Revealed preferences in finance edit In financial applications eg portfolio optimization an investor chooses financial portfolio which maximizes hisher own utility function or equivalently minimizes hisher risk measure For example modern portfolio theory selects variance as a measure of risk other popular theories are expected utility theory 3 and prospect theory 4 To determine specific utility function for any given investor one could design a questionnaire procedure with questions in the form How much would you pay for x chance of getting y Revealed preference theory suggests a more direct approach observe a portfolio X which an investor currently holds and then find a utility functionrisk measure such that X becomes an optimal portfolio 5 Examples edit In order to simplify calculations various alternative assumptions have been made concerning details of human preferences and these imply various alternative utility functions such as CES constant elasticity of substitution or isoelastic utility Isoelastic utility Exponential utility Quasilinear utility Homothetic preferences StoneGeary utility function Gorman polar form GreenwoodHercowitzHuffman preferences KingPlosserRebelo preferences Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion Most utility functions used in modeling or theory are wellbehaved They are usually monotonic and quasiconcave However it is possible for preferences not to be representable by a utility function An example is lexicographic preferences which are not continuous and cannot be represented by a continuous utility function 6 Expected utility edit Main article Expected utility hypothesis The expected utility theory deals with the analysis of choices among risky projects with multiple possibly multidimensional outcomes The St Petersburg paradox was first proposed by Nicholas Bernoulli in 1713 and solved by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738 D Bernoulli argued that the paradox could be resolved if decisionmakers displayed risk aversion and argued for a logarithmic cardinal utility function Analyses of international survey data in the 21st century have shown that insofar as utility represents happiness as in utilitarianism it is indeed proportional to log income The first important use of the expected utility theory was that of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern who used the assumption of expected utility maximization in their formulation of game theory von NeumannMorgenstern edit Main article Von NeumannMorgenstern utility theorem Von Neumann and Morgenstern addressed situations in which the outcomes of choices are not known with certainty but have probabilities attached to them A notation for a lottery is as follows if options A and B have probability p and 1 p in the lottery we write it as a linear combination L p A 1 p B displaystyle LpA1pB More generally for a lottery with many possible options L i p i A i displaystyle Lsum ipiAi where i p i 1 displaystyle sum ipi1 By making some reasonable assumptions about the way choices behave von Neumann and Morgenstern showed that if an agent can choose between the lotteries then this agent has a utility function such that the desirability of an arbitrary lottery can be calculated as a linear combination of the utilities of its parts with the weights being their probabilities of occurring This is called the expected utility theorem The required assumptions are four axioms about the properties of the agents preference relation over simple lotteries which are lotteries with just two options Writing B A displaystyle Bpreceq A to mean A is weakly preferred to B A is preferred at least as much as B the axioms are completeness For any two simple lotteries L displaystyle L and M displaystyle M either L M displaystyle Lpreceq M or M L displaystyle Mpreceq L or both in which case they are viewed as equally desirable transitivity for any three lotteries L M N displaystyle LMN if L M displaystyle Lpreceq M and M N displaystyle Mpreceq N then L N displaystyle Lpreceq N convexitycontinuity Archimedean property If L M N displaystyle Lpreceq Mpreceq N then there is a p displaystyle p between 0 and 1 such that the lottery p L 1 p N displaystyle pL1pN is equally desirable as M displaystyle M independence for any three lotteries L M N displaystyle LMN and any probability p L M displaystyle Lpreceq M if and only if p L 1 p N p M 1 p N displaystyle pL1pNpreceq pM1pN Intuitively if the lottery formed by the probabilistic combination of L displaystyle L and N displaystyle N is no more preferable than the lottery formed by the same probabilistic combination of M displaystyle M and N displaystyle N then and only then L M displaystyle Lpreceq M Axioms 3 and 4 enable us to decide about the relative utilities of two assets or lotteries In more formal language A von NeumannMorgenstern utility function is a function from choices to the real numbers u X R displaystyle ucolon Xto mathbb R which assigns a real number to every outcome in a way that captures the agents preferences over simple lotteries Under the four assumptions mentioned above the agent will prefer a lottery L 2 displaystyle L2 to a lottery L 1 displaystyle L1 if and only if for the utility function characterizing that agent the expected utility of L 2 displaystyle L2 is greater than the expected utility of L 1 displaystyle L1 L 1 L 2 iff u L 1 u L 2 displaystyle L1preceq L2text iff uL1leq uL2 Of all the axioms independence is the most often discarded A variety of generalized expected utility theories have arisen most of which drop or relax the independence axiom As probability of success edit Castagnoli and LiCalzi 1996 and Bordley and LiCalzi 2000 provided another interpretation for Von Neumann and Morgensterns theory Specifically for any utility function there exists a hypothetical reference lottery with the expected utility of an arbitrary lottery being its probability of performing no worse than the reference lottery Suppose success is defined as getting an outcome no worse than the outcome of the reference lottery Then this mathematical equivalence means that maximizing expected utility is equivalent to maximizing the probability of success In many contexts this makes the concept of utility easier to justify and to apply For example a firms utility might be the probability of meeting uncertain future customer expectations 7 8 9 10 Indirect utility edit Main article Indirect utility An indirect utility function gives the optimal attainable value of a given utility function which depends on the prices of the goods and the income or wealth level that the individual possesses Money edit One use of the indirect utility concept is the notion of the utility of money The indirect utility function for money is a nonlinear function that is bounded and asymmetric about the origin The utility function is concave in the positive region reflecting the phenomenon of diminishing marginal utility The boundedness reflects the fact that beyond a certain point money ceases being useful at all as the size of any economy at any point in time is itself bounded The asymmetry about the origin reflects the fact that gaining and losing money can have radically different implications both for individuals and businesses The nonlinearity of the utility function for money has profound implications in decision making processes in situations where outcomes of choices influence utility through gains or losses of money which are the norm in most business settings the optimal choice for a given decision depends on the possible outcomes of all other decisions in the same timeperiod 11 Discussion and criticism edit Cambridge economist Joan Robinson famously criticized utility for being a circular concept Utility is the quality in commodities that makes individuals want to buy them and the fact that individuals want to buy commodities shows that they have utility 12 48 Robinson also pointed out that because the theory assumes that preferences are fixed this means that utility is not a testable assumption This is so because if we take changes in peoples behavior in relation to a change in prices or a change in the underlying budget constraint we can never be sure to what extent the change in behavior was due to the change in price or budget constraint and how much was due to a change in preferences 13 This criticism is similar to that of the philosopher Hans Albert who argued that the ceteris paribus conditions on which the marginalist theory of demand rested rendered the theory itself an empty tautology and completely closed to experimental testing 14 In essence demand and supply curve theoretical line of quantity of a product which would have been offered or requested for given price is purely ontological and could never been demonstrated empirically Another criticism comes from the assertion that neither cardinal nor ordinal utility is empirically observable in the real world In the case of cardinal utility it is impossible to measure the level of satisfaction quantitatively when someone consumes or purchases an apple In case of ordinal utility it is impossible to determine what choices were made when someone purchases for example an orange Any act would involve preference over a vast set of choices such as apple orange juice other vegetable vitamin C tablets exercise not purchasing etc 15 16 Other questions of what arguments ought to enter into a utility function are difficult to answer yet seem necessary to understanding utility Whether people gain utility from coherence of wants beliefs or a sense of duty is key to understanding their behavior in the utility organon 17 Likewise choosing between alternatives is itself a process of determining what to consider as alternatives a question of choice within uncertainty 18 An evolutionary psychology perspective is that utility may be better viewed as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary fitness in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one 19 See also edit Business and Economics portal Law of demand Marginal utility Utility maximization problem Decisionmaking
