attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverseengineering the mammalian brain down to the molecular level Google Brain A deep learning project part of Google X attempting to have intelligence similar or equal to humanlevel Human Brain Project NuPIC an open source implementation by Numenta of its cortical learning algorithm Cognitive architectures edit 4CAPS developed at Carnegie Mellon University under Marcel A Just ACTR developed at Carnegie Mellon University under John R Anderson AIXI Universal Artificial Intelligence developed by Marcus Hutter at IDSIA and ANU CALO a DARPAfunded 25institution effort to integrate many artificial intelligence approaches natural language processing speech recognition machine vision probabilistic logic planning reasoning many forms of machine learning into an AI assistant that learns to help manage your office environment CHREST developed under Fernand Gobet at Brunel University and Peter C Lane at the University of Hertfordshire CLARION developed under Ron Sun at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and University of Missouri CoJACK an ACTR inspired extension to the JACK multiagent system that adds a cognitive architecture to the agents for eliciting more realistic humanlike behaviors in virtual environments Copycat by Douglas Hofstadter and Melanie Mitchell at the Indiana University DUAL developed at the New Bulgarian University under Boicho Kokinov FORR developed by Susan L Epstein at The City University of New York IDA and LIDA implementing Global Workspace Theory developed under Stan Franklin at the University of Memphis

the OttoFriedrich University in Bamberg Germany RCAST developed at the Pennsylvania State University Soar developed under Allen Newell and John Laird at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Michigan Society of mind and its successor the Emotion machine proposed by Marvin Minsky Subsumption architectures developed eg by Rodney Brooks though it could be argued whether they are cognitive Games edit AlphaGo software developed by Google that plays the Chinese board game Go Chinook a computer program that plays English draughts the first to win the world champion title in the competition against humans Deep Blue a chessplaying computer developed by IBM which beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 FreeHAL a selflearning conversation simulator chatterbot which uses semantic nets to organize its knowledge to imitate a very close human behavior within conversations Halite an artificial intelligence programming competition created by Two Sigma Libratus a poker AI that beat worldclass poker players in 2017 intended to be generalisable to other applications Quick Draw an online game developed by Google that challenges players to draw a picture of an object or idea and then uses a neural network to guess what the drawing is Stockfish AI an open source chess engine currently ranked the highest in many computer chess rankings TDGammon a program that learned to play worldclass backgammon partly by playing against itself temporal difference learning with neural networks Internet activism edit Serenata de Amor project for the analysis of public expenditures and detect discrepancies

highperformance fullfeatured text search engine library written entirely in Java Apache OpenNLP a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text It supports the most common NLP tasks such as tokenization sentence segmentation partofspeech tagging named entity extraction chunking and parsing Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity ALICE an awardwinning natural language processing chatterbot Cleverbot successor to Jabberwacky now with 170m lines of conversation Deep Context fuzziness and parallel processing Cleverbot learns from around 2 million user interactions per month ELIZA a famous 1966 computer program by Joseph Weizenbaum which parodied personcentered therapy Jabberwacky a chatterbot by Rollo Carpenter aiming to simulate natural human chat
