levels in the OECD 28 San Francisco was founded on June 29 1776 when colonists from Spain established Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asís a few miles away all named for St Francis of Assisi 2 The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time San Francisco became a consolidated citycounty in 1856 29 San Franciscos status as the West Coasts largest city peaked between 1870 and 1900 when around 25 of Californias population resided in the city proper 30 After threequarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire 31 San Francisco was quickly rebuilt hosting the PanamaPacific International Exposition nine years later In World War II San Francisco was a major port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater 32 It then became the birthplace of the United Nations in 1945 33 34 35 After the war the confluence of returning servicemen significant immigration liberalizing attitudes along with the rise of the hippie counterculture the Sexual Revolution the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the

evidence of human habitation of the territory of the city of San Francisco dates to 3000BC 40 The Yelamu group of the Ohlone people resided in a few small villages when an overland Spanish exploration party led by Don Gaspar de Portolá arrived on November 2 1769 the first documented European visit to San Francisco Bay 41 Seven years later on March 28 1776 the Spanish established the Presidio of San Francisco followed by a mission Mission San Francisco de Asís Mission Dolores established by the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza 2 View of San Francisco 184647 1853 United States Coast Survey map Upon independence from Spain in 1821 the area became part of Mexico Under Mexican rule the mission system gradually ended and its lands became privatized In 1835 William Richardson a naturalized Mexican citizen of English birth erected the first independent homestead 42 near a boat anchorage around what is today Portsmouth Square Together with Alcalde Francisco de Haro he laid out a street plan for the expanded settlement and the town named Yerba Buena began to attract American settlers Commodore John D Sloat claimed California for the United States on July 7 1846 during the MexicanAmerican War and Captain John B Montgomery arrived to claim Yerba Buena two days later Yerba Buena was renamed San Francisco on January 30 of the next year and Mexico officially ceded the territory to the United States at the end of the war Despite its attractive location as a port and naval base San Francisco was still a small settlement with inhospitable geography 43 Francis Samuel Marryat Hilltop of San Francisco California Looking toward the Bay 1849 M N Hanhart Chromolithograph Port of San Francisco in 1851 The California Gold Rush brought a flood of treasure seekers known as fortyniners as in 1849 With their sourdough bread in tow 44 prospectors accumulated in San Francisco over rival Benicia 45 raising the population from 1000 in 1848 to 25000 by December 1849 46 The promise of great wealth was so strong that crews on arriving vessels deserted and rushed off to the gold fields leaving behind a forest of masts in San Francisco harbor 47 Some of these approximately 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships saloons and hotels many were left to rot and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot By 1851 the harbor was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships By 1870 Yerba Buena Cove had been filled to create new land Buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings 48 California was quickly granted statehood in 1850 and the US military built Fort Point at the Golden Gate and a fort on Alcatraz Island to secure the San Francisco Bay Silver discoveries including the Comstock Lode in Nevada in 1859 further drove rapid population growth 49 With hordes of fortune seekers streaming through the city lawlessness was common and the Barbary Coast section of town gained notoriety as a haven for criminals prostitution and gambling 50 Entrepreneurs sought to capitalize on the wealth generated by the Gold Rush Early winners were the banking industry with the founding of Wells Fargo in 1852 and the Bank of California in 1864 Development of the Port of San Francisco and the establishment in 1869 of overland access to the eastern US rail system via the newly completed Pacific Railroad the construction of which the city only reluctantly helped support 51 helped make the Bay Area a center for trade Catering to the needs and tastes of the growing population Levi Strauss opened a dry goods business and Domingo Ghirardelli began manufacturing chocolate Immigrant laborers made the city a polyglot culture with Chinese Railroad Workers drawn to Old Gold Mountain creating the citys Chinatown quarter In 1870 Asians made up 8 of the population 52 The first cable cars carried San Franciscans up Clay Street in 1873 The citys sea of Victorian houses began to take shape and civic leaders campaigned for a spacious public park resulting in plans for Golden Gate Park San Franciscans built schools churches theaters and all the hallmarks of civic life The Presidio developed into the most important American military installation on the Pacific coast 53 By 1890 San Franciscos population approached 300000 making it the eighthlargest city in the United States at the time Around 1901 San Francisco was a major city known for its flamboyant style stately hotels ostentatious mansions on Nob Hill and a thriving arts scene 54 The first North American plague epidemic was the San Francisco plague of 19001904 55 At 512am on April 18 1906 a major earthquake struck San Francisco and northern California As buildings collapsed from the shaking ruptured gas lines ignited fires that spread across the city and burned out of control for several days With water mains out of service the Presidio Artillery Corps attempted to contain the inferno by dynamiting blocks of buildings to create firebreaks 56 More than threequarters of the city lay in ruins including almost all of the downtown core 31 Contemporary accounts reported that 498 people lost their lives though modern estimates put the number in the several thousands 57 More than half of the citys population of 400000 was left homeless 58 Refugees settled temporarily in makeshift tent villages in Golden Gate Park the Presidio on the beaches and elsewhere Many fled permanently to the East Bay Not in history has a modern imperial city been so completely destroyed San Francisco is gone Jack London after the 1906 earthquake and fire 59 The Palace of Fine Arts at the 1915 PanamaPacific Exposition Rebuilding was rapid and performed on a grand scale Rejecting calls to completely remake the street grid San Franciscans opted for speed 60 Amadeo Giannini s Bank of Italy later to become Bank of America provided loans for many of those whose livelihoods had been devastated The influential San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association or SPUR was founded in 1910 to address the quality of housing after the earthquake 61 The earthquake hastened development of western neighborhoods that survived the fire including Pacific Heights where many of the citys wealthy rebuilt their homes 62 In turn the destroyed mansions of Nob Hill became grand hotels City Hall rose again in splendid Beaux Arts style and the city celebrated its rebirth at the PanamaPacific International Exposition in 1915 63 It was during this period San Francisco built some of its most important infrastructure Civil Engineer Michael OShaughnessy was hired by San Francisco Mayor James Rolph as chief engineer for the city in September 1912 to supervise the construction of the Twin Peaks Reservoir the Stockton Street Tunnel the Twin Peaks Tunnel the San Francisco Municipal Railway the Auxiliary Water Supply System and new sewers San Franciscos streetcar system of which the J K L M and N lines survive today was pushed to completion by OShaughnessy between 1915 and 1927 It was the OShaughnessy Dam Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct that would have the largest effect on San Francisco 64 An abundant water supply enabled San Francisco to develop into the city it has become today The Bay Bridge under construction in 1935 took forty months to complete In ensuing years the city solidified its standing as a financial capital in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash not a single San Franciscobased bank failed 65 Indeed it was at the height of the Great Depression that San Francisco undertook two great civil engineering projects simultaneously constructing the San FranciscoOakland Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge completing them in 1936 and 1937 respectively It was in this period that the island of Alcatraz a former military stockade began its service as a federal maximum security prison housing notorious inmates such as Al Capone and Robert Franklin Stroud the Birdman of Alcatraz San Francisco later celebrated its regained grandeur with a Worlds fair the Golden Gate International Exposition in 193940 creating Treasure Island in the middle of the bay to house it The USS San Francisco steams under the Golden Gate Bridge in 1942 during World WarII During World War II the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard became a hub of activity and Fort Mason became the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater of Operations 32 The explosion of jobs drew many people especially African Americans from the South to the area After the end of the war many military personnel returning from service abroad and civilians who had originally come to work decided to stay The United Nations Charter creating the United Nations was drafted and signed in San Francisco in 1945 and in 1951 the Treaty of San Francisco officially ended the war with Japan Urban planning projects in the 1950s and 1960s involved widespread destruction and redevelopment of westside neighborhoods and the construction of new freeways of which only a series of short segments were built before being halted by citizenled opposition 66 The onset of containerization made San Franciscos small piers obsolete and cargo activity moved to the larger Port of Oakland 67 The city began to lose industrial jobs and turned to tourism as the most important segment of its economy 68 The suburbs experienced rapid growth and San Francisco underwent significant demographic change as large segments of the white population left the city supplanted by an increasing wave of immigration from Asia and Latin America 69 70 From 1950 to 1980 the city lost over 10 percent of its population Over this period San Francisco became a magnet for Americas counterculture Beat Generation writers fueled the San Francisco Renaissance and centered on the North Beach neighborhood in the 1950s 71 Hippies flocked to HaightAshbury in the 1960s reaching a peak with the 1967 Summer of Love 72 In 1974 the Zebra murders left at least 16 people dead 73 In the 1970s the city became a center of the gay rights movement with the emergence of The Castro as an urban gay village the election of Harvey Milk to the Board of Supervisors and his assassination along with that of Mayor George Moscone in 1978 74 Bank of America completed 555 California Street in 1969 and the Transamerica Pyramid was completed in 1972 75 igniting a wave of Manhattanization that lasted until the late 1980s a period of extensive highrise development downtown 76 The 1980s also saw a dramatic increase in the number of homeless people in the city an issue that remains today despite many attempts to address it 77 The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake caused destruction and loss of life throughout the Bay Area In San Francisco the quake severely damaged structures in the Marina and South of Market districts and precipitated the demolition of the damaged Embarcadero Freeway and much of the damaged Central Freeway allowing the city to reclaim The Embarcadero as its historic downtown waterfront and revitalizing the Hayes Valley neighborhood Two recent decades have seen two booms driven by the internet industry First was the dotcom boom of the late 1990s startup companies invigorated the San Francisco economy Large numbers of entrepreneurs and computer application developers moved into the city followed by marketing design and sales professionals changing the social landscape as oncepoorer neighborhoods became increasingly gentrified 78 Demand for new housing and office space ignited a second wave of highrise development this time in the South of Market district 79 By 2000 the citys population reached new highs surpassing the previous record set in 1950 When the bubble burst in 2001 many of these companies folded and their employees were laid off Yet high technology and entrepreneurship remain mainstays of the San Francisco economy By the mid2000s decade the social media boom had begun with San Francisco becoming a popular location for tech offices and a common place to live for people employed in Silicon Valley companies such as Apple and Google 80 The Ferry Station Post Office Building Armour Co Building Atherton House and YMCA Hotel are historic buildings among dozens of historical landmarks in the city according to the National Register of Historic Places listings in San Francisco Geography edit The San Francisco Peninsula San Francisco is located on the West Coast of the United States at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula and includes significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay within its boundaries Several picturesque islands Alcatraz Treasure Island and the adjacent Yerba Buena Island and small portions of Alameda Island Red Rock Island and Angel Island are part of the city Also included are the uninhabited Farallon Islands 27 miles 43km offshore in the Pacific Ocean The mainland within the city limits roughly forms a sevenbysevenmile square a common local colloquialism referring to the citys shape though its total area including water is nearly 232 square miles 600km 2 Cars navigate Lombard Street to descend Russian Hill There are more than 50 hills within the city limits 81 Some neighborhoods are named after the hill on which they are situated including Nob Hill Potrero Hill and Russian Hill Near the geographic center of the city southwest of the downtown area are a series of less densely populated hills Twin Peaks a pair of hills forming one of the citys highest points forms an overlook spot San Franciscos tallest hill Mount Davidson is 928 feet 283m high and is capped with a 103foot 31m tall cross built in 1934 82 Dominating this area is Sutro Tower a large red and white radio and television transmission tower The nearby San Andreas and Hayward Faults are responsible for much earthquake activity although neither physically passes through the city itself The San Andreas Fault caused the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989 Minor earthquakes occur on a regular basis The threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the citys infrastructure development The city constructed an auxiliary water supply system and has repeatedly upgraded its building codes requiring retrofits for older buildings and higher engineering standards for new construction 83 However there are still thousands of smaller buildings that remain vulnerable to quake damage 84 USGS has released the California earthquake forecast which models earthquake occurrence in California 85 San Franciscos shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits Entire neighborhoods such as the Marina Mission Bay and Hunters Point as well as large sections of the Embarcadero sit on areas of landfill Treasure Island was constructed from material dredged from the bay as well as material resulting from the excavation of the Yerba Buena Tunnel through Yerba Buena Island during the construction of the Bay Bridge Such land tends to be unstable during earthquakes The resulting soil liquefaction causes extensive damage to property built upon it as was evidenced in the Marina district during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake 86 Most of the citys natural watercourses such as Islais Creek and Mission Creek have been culverted and built over although the Public Utilities Commission is studying proposals to daylight or restore some creeks 87 Cityscape edit Main article List of Landmarks and Historic Places in San Francisco Downtown San Francisco seen from Twin Peaks in

Neighborhoods edit San Franciscos Chinatown is the oldest and one of the largest in North America Main article Neighborhoods in San Francisco See also List of tallest buildings in San Francisco The historic center of San Francisco is the northeast quadrant of the city anchored by Market Street and the waterfront It is here that the Financial District is centered with Union Square the principal shopping and hotel district and the Tenderloin nearby Cable cars carry riders up steep inclines to the summit of Nob Hill once the home of the citys business tycoons and down to the waterfront tourist attractions of Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39 where many restaurants feature Dungeness crab from a stillactive fishing industry Also in this quadrant are Russian Hill a residential neighborhood with the famously crooked Lombard Street North Beach the citys Little Italy and the former center of the Beat Generation and Telegraph Hill which features Coit Tower Abutting Russian Hill and North Beach is San Franciscos Chinatown the oldest Chinatown in North America 88 89 90 91 The South of Market which was once San Franciscos industrial core has seen significant redevelopment following the construction of Oracle Park and an infusion of startup companies New skyscrapers livework lofts and condominiums dot the area Further development is taking place just to the south in Mission Bay area a former railroad yard which now has a second campus of the University of California San Francisco and where the new Warriors arena will be built 92 West of downtown across Van Ness Avenue lies the large Western Addition neighborhood which became established with a large African American population after World War II The Western Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including Hayes Valley the Fillmore and Japantown which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its Japanese American residents were forcibly removed and interned during World War II The Western Addition survived the 1906 earthquake with its Victorians largely intact including the famous Painted Ladies standing alongside Alamo Square To the south near the geographic center of the city is HaightAshbury famously associated with 1960s hippie culture The Haight is now home to some expensive boutiques 93 and a few controversial chain stores 94 although it still retains some bohemian character Skyscrapers are common in northeast San Francisco the citys downtown North of the Western Addition is Pacific Heights an affluent neighborhood that features the homes built by wealthy San Franciscans in the wake of the 1906 earthquake Directly north of Pacific Heights facing the waterfront is the Marina a neighborhood popular with young professionals that was largely built on reclaimed land from the Bay 95 The Transamerica Pyramid was the tallest building in San Francisco until 2016 when Salesforce Tower surpassed it In the southeast quadrant of the city is the Mission District populated in the 19th century by Californios and workingclass immigrants from Germany Ireland Italy and Scandinavia In the 1910s a wave of Central American immigrants settled in the Mission and in the 1950s immigrants from Mexico began to predominate 96 In recent years gentrification has changed the demographics of parts of the Mission from Latino to twentysomething professionals Noe Valley to the southwest and Bernal Heights to the south are both increasingly popular among young families with children East of the Mission is the Potrero Hill neighborhood a mostly residential neighborhood that features sweeping views of downtown San Francisco West of the Mission the area historically known as Eureka Valley now popularly called the Castro was once a workingclass Scandinavian and Irish area It has become North Americas first gay village and is now the center of gay life in the city 97 Located near the citys southern border the Excelsior District is one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in San Francisco The predominantly African American BayviewHunters Point in the far southeast corner of the city is one of the poorest neighborhoods and suffers from a high rate of crime though the area has been the focus of several revitalizing and controversial urban renewal projects The construction of the Twin Peaks Tunnel in 1918 connected southwest neighborhoods to downtown via streetcar hastening the development of West Portal and nearby affluent Forest Hill and St Francis Wood Further west stretching all the way to the Pacific Ocean and north to Golden Gate Park lies the vast Sunset District a large middle class area with a predominantly Asian population 98 The northwestern quadrant of the city contains the Richmond also a mostly middleclass neighborhood north of Golden Gate Park home to immigrants from other parts of Asia as well as many Russian and Ukrainian immigrants Together these areas are known as The Avenues These two districts are each sometimes further divided into two regions the Outer Richmond and Outer Sunset can refer to the more western portions of their respective district and the Inner Richmond and Inner Sunset can refer to the more eastern portions Many piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the Embarcadero Freeway reopened the downtown waterfront allowing for redevelopment The centerpiece of the port the Ferry Building while still receiving commuter ferry traffic has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace Climate edit San Francisco has a warmsummer Mediterranean climate Köppen Csb characteristic of Californias coast with moist mild winters and dry summers 99 San Franciscos weather is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the Pacific Ocean on the west side of the city and the water of San Francisco Bay to the north and east This moderates temperature swings and produces a remarkably mild yearround climate with little seasonal temperature variation Fog is a regular feature of San Francisco summers Among major US cities San Francisco has the coolest daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures for June July and August 100 During the summer rising hot air in Californias interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate which creates the citys characteristic cool winds and fog 101 The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods and during the late summer and early fall As a result the years warmest month on average is September and on average October is warmer than July especially in daytime Because of its sharp topography and maritime influences San Francisco exhibits a multitude of distinct microclimates The high hills in the geographic center of the city are responsible for a 20 variance in annual rainfall between different parts of the city They also protect neighborhoods directly to their east from the foggy and sometimes very cold and windy conditions experienced in the Sunset District for those who live on the eastern side of the city San Francisco is sunnier with an average of 260 clear days and only 105 cloudy days per year Temperatures reach or exceed 80F 27C on an average of only 21 and 23days a year at downtown and San Francisco International Airport SFO respectively 102 The dry period of May to October is mild to warm with the normal monthly mean temperature peaking in September at 627F 171C 102 The rainy period of November to April is slightly cooler with the normal monthly mean temperature reaching its lowest in January at 513F 107C 102 On average there are 73 rainy days a year and annual precipitation averages 2365 inches 601mm 102 Variation in precipitation from year to year is high Above average rain years are often associated with warm El Niño conditions in the Pacific while dry years often occur in cold water La Niña periods In 2013 a La Niña year a record low 559in 142mm of rainfall was recorded at downtown San Francisco where records have been kept since 1849 102 Snowfall in the city is very rare with only 10 measurable accumulations recorded since 1852 most recently in 1976 when up to 5 inches 130mm fell on Twin Peaks 103 104 The highest recorded temperature at the official National Weather Service downtown observation station currently at the United States Mint building was
