multidisciplinary branch of biology 2 that combines physiology anatomy molecular biology developmental biology cytology mathematical modeling and psychology to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of neurons and neural circuits 3 4 5 6 7 The understanding of the biological basis of learning memory behavior perception and consciousness has been described by Eric Kandel as the ultimate challenge of the biological sciences 8 The scope of neuroscience has broadened over time to include different approaches used to study the nervous system at different scales and the techniques used by neuroscientists have expanded enormously from molecular and cellular studies of individual neurons to imaging of sensory motor and cognitive tasks in the brain Contents 1 History 2 Modern neuroscience

neuroscience Illustration from Grays Anatomy 1918 of a lateral view of the human brain featuring the hippocampus among other neuroanatomical features The earliest study of the nervous system dates to ancient Egypt Trepanation the surgical practice of either drilling or scraping a hole into the skull for the purpose of curing head injuries or mental disorders or relieving cranial pressure was first recorded during the Neolithic period Manuscripts dating to 1700BC indicate that the Egyptians had some knowledge about symptoms of brain damage 9 Early views on the function of the brain regarded it to be a cranial stuffing of sorts In Egypt from the late Middle Kingdom onwards the brain was regularly removed in preparation for mummification It was believed at the time that the heart was the seat of intelligence According to Herodotus the first step of mummification was to take a crooked piece of iron and with it draw out the brain through the nostrils thus getting rid of a portion while the skull is cleared of the rest by rinsing with drugs 10 The view that the heart was the source of consciousness was not challenged until the time of the Greek physician Hippocrates He believed that the brain was not only involved with sensationsince most specialized organs egeyes ears tongue are located in the head near the brainbut was also the seat of intelligence Plato also speculated that the brain was the seat of the rational part of the soul 11 Aristotle however believed the heart was the center of intelligence and that the brain regulated the amount of heat from the heart 12 This view was generally accepted until the Roman physician Galen a follower of Hippocrates and physician to Roman gladiators observed that his patients lost their mental faculties when they had sustained damage to their brains Abulcasis Averroes Avicenna Avenzoar and Maimonides active in the Medieval Muslim world described a number of medical problems related to the brain In Renaissance Europe Vesalius 15141564 René Descartes 15961650 Thomas Willis 16211675 and Jan Swammerdam 16371680 also made several contributions to neuroscience The Golgi stain first allowed for the visualization of individual neurons Luigi Galvani s pioneering work in the late 1700s set the stage for studying the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons In the first half of the 19th century Jean Pierre Flourens pioneered the experimental method of carrying out localized lesions of the brain in living animals describing their effects on motricity sensibility and behavior In 1843 Emil du BoisReymond demonstrated the electrical nature of the nerve signal 13 whose speed Hermann von Helmholtz proceeded to measure 14 and in 1875 Richard Caton found electrical phenomena in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys 15 Adolf Beck published in 1890 similar observations of spontaneous electrical activity of the brain of rabbits and dogs 16 Studies of the brain became more sophisticated after the invention of the microscope and the development of a staining procedure by Camillo Golgi during the late 1890s The procedure used a silver chromate salt to reveal the intricate structures of individual neurons His technique was used by Santiago Ramón y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron 17 Golgi and Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for their extensive observations descriptions and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain In parallel with this research work with braindamaged patients by Paul Broca suggested that certain regions of the brain were responsible for certain functions At the time Brocas findings were seen as a confirmation of Franz Joseph Gall s theory that language was localized and that certain psychological functions were localized in specific areas of the cerebral cortex 18 19 The localization of function hypothesis was supported by observations of epileptic patients conducted by John Hughlings Jackson who correctly inferred the organization of the motor cortex by watching the progression of seizures through the body Carl Wernicke further developed the theory of the specialization of specific brain structures in language comprehension and production Modern research through neuroimaging techniques still uses the Brodmann cerebral cytoarchitectonic map referring to study of cell structure anatomical definitions from this era in continuing to show that distinct areas of the cortex are activated in the execution of specific tasks 20 During the 20th century neuroscience began to be recognized as a distinct academic discipline in its own right rather than as studies of the nervous system within other disciplines Eric Kandel and collaborators have cited David Rioch Francis O Schmitt and Stephen Kuffler as having played critical roles in establishing the field 21 Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research starting in the 1950s During the same period Schmitt established a neuroscience research program within the Biology Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology bringing together biology chemistry physics and mathematics The first freestanding neuroscience department then called Psychobiology was founded in 1964 at the University of California Irvine by James L McGaugh 22 This was followed by the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School which was founded in 1966 by Stephen Kuffler 23 The understanding of neurons and of nervous system function became increasingly precise and molecular during the 20th century For example in 1952 Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley presented a mathematical model for transmission of electrical signals in neurons of the giant axon of a squid which they called action potentials and how they are initiated and propagated known as the HodgkinHuxley model In 19611962 Richard FitzHugh and J Nagumo simplified HodgkinHuxley in what is called the FitzHughNagumo model In 1962 Bernard Katz modeled neurotransmission across the space between neurons known as synapses Beginning in 1966 Eric Kandel and collaborators examined biochemical changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage in Aplysia In 1981 Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar combined these models in the MorrisLecar model Such increasingly quantitative work gave rise to numerous biological neuron models and models of neural computation As a result of the increasing interest about the nervous system several prominent neuroscience organizations have been formed to provide a forum to all neuroscientist during the 20th century For example the International Brain Research Organization was founded in 1961 24 the International Society for Neurochemistry in 1963 25 the European Brain and Behaviour Society in 1968 26 and the Society for Neuroscience in 1969 27 Recently the application of neuroscience research results has also given rise to applied disciplines as neuroeconomics 28 neuroeducation 29 neuroethics 30 and neurolaw 31 Over time brain research has gone through philosophical experimental and theoretical phases with work on brain simulation predicted to be important in the future 32 Modern neuroscience edit Main article Outline of neuroscience Human nervous system The scientific study of the nervous system increased significantly during the second half of the twentieth century principally due to advances in molecular biology electrophysiology and computational neuroscience This has allowed neuroscientists to study the nervous system in all its aspects how it is structured how it works how it develops how it malfunctions and how it can be changed For example it has become possible to understand in much detail the complex processes occurring within a single neuron Neurons are cells specialized for communication They are able to communicate with neurons and other cell types through specialized junctions called synapses at which electrical or electrochemical signals can be transmitted from one cell to another Many neurons extrude a long thin filament of axoplasm called an axon which may extend to distant parts of the body and are capable of rapidly carrying electrical signals influencing the activity of other neurons muscles or glands at their termination points A nervous system emerges from the assemblage of neurons that are connected to each other The vertebrate nervous system can be split into two parts the central nervous system defined as the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system In many species including all vertebrates the nervous system is the most complex organ system in the body with most of the complexity residing in the brain The human brain alone contains around one hundred billion neurons and one hundred trillion synapses it consists of thousands of distinguishable substructures connected to each other in synaptic networks whose intricacies have only begun to be unraveled At least one out of three of the approximately 20000 genes belonging to the human genome is expressed mainly in the brain 33 Due to the high degree of plasticity of the human brain the structure of its synapses and their resulting functions change throughout life 34 Making sense of the nervous systems dynamic complexity is a formidable research challenge Ultimately neuroscientists would like to understand every aspect of the nervous system including how it works how it develops how it malfunctions and how it can be altered or repaired Analysis of the nervous system is therefore performed at multiple levels ranging from the molecular and cellular levels to the systems and cognitive levels The specific topics that form the main foci of research change over time driven by an everexpanding base of knowledge and the availability of increasingly sophisticated technical methods Improvements in technology have been the primary drivers of progress Developments in electron microscopy computer science electronics functional neuroimaging and genetics and genomics have all been major drivers of progress Molecular and cellular neuroscience edit Main articles Molecular neuroscience and Cellular neuroscience Photograph of a stained neuron in a chicken embryo Basic questions addressed in molecular neuroscience include the mechanisms by which neurons express and respond to molecular signals and how axons form complex connectivity patterns At this level tools from molecular biology and genetics are used to understand how neurons develop and how genetic changes affect biological functions The morphology molecular identity and physiological characteristics of neurons and how they relate to different types of behavior are also of considerable interest Questions addressed in cellular neuroscience include the mechanisms of how neurons process signals physiologically and electrochemically These questions include how signals are processed by neurites and somas and how neurotransmitters and electrical signals are used to process information in a neuron Neurites are thin extensions from a neuronal cell body consisting of dendrites specialized to receive synaptic inputs from other neurons and axons specialized to conduct nerve impulses called action potentials Somas are the cell bodies of the neurons and contain the nucleus Another major area of cellular neuroscience is the investigation of the development of the nervous system Questions include the patterning and regionalization of the nervous system neural stem cells differentiation of neurons and glia neurogenesis and gliogenesis neuronal migration axonal and dendritic development trophic interactions and synapse formation Computational neurogenetic modeling is concerned with the development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes Neural circuits and systems edit Main articles Neural circuit and Systems neuroscience Proposed organization of motorsemantic neural circuits for action language comprehension Adapted from Shebani et al 2013 Questions in systems neuroscience include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce functions such as reflexes multisensory integration motor coordination circadian rhythms emotional responses learning and memory In other words they address how these neural circuits function in large scale brain networks and the mechanisms through which behaviors are generated For example systems level analysis addresses questions concerning specific sensory and motor modalities how does vision work How do songbirds learn new songs and bats localize with ultrasound How does the somatosensory system process tactile information The related fields of neuroethology and neuropsychology address the question of how neural substrates underlie specific animal and human behaviors Neuroendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology examine interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine and immune systems respectively Despite many advancements the way that networks of neurons perform complex cognitive processes and behaviors is still poorly understood Cognitive and behavioral neuroscience edit Main articles Behavioral neuroscience and Cognitive neuroscience Cognitive neuroscience addresses the questions of how psychological functions are produced by neural circuitry The emergence of powerful new measurement techniques such as neuroimaging eg fMRI PET SPECT EEG MEG electrophysiology optogenetics and human genetic analysis combined with sophisticated experimental techniques from cognitive psychology allows neuroscientists and psychologists to address abstract questions such as how cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates Although many studies still hold a reductionist stance looking for the neurobiological basis of cognitive phenomena recent research shows that there is an interesting interplay between neuroscientific findings and conceptual research soliciting and integrating both perspectives For example the neuroscience research on empathy solicited an interesting interdisciplinary debate involving philosophy psychology and psychopathology 35 Moreover the neuroscientific identification of multiple memory systems related to different brain areas has challenged the idea of memory as a literal reproduction of the past supporting a view of memory as a generative constructive and dynamic process 36 Neuroscience is also allied with the social and behavioral sciences as well as nascent interdisciplinary fields such as neuroeconomics decision theory social neuroscience and neuromarketing to address complex questions about interactions of the brain with its environment A study into consumer responses for example uses EEG to investigate neural correlates associated with narrative transportation into stories about energy efficiency 37 Computational neuroscience edit Main article Computational neuroscience Questions in computational neuroscience can span a wide range of levels of traditional analysis such as development structure and cognitive functions of the brain Research in this field utilizes mathematical models theoretical analysis and computer simulation to describe and verify biologically plausible neurons and nervous systems For example biological neuron models are mathematical descriptions of spiking neurons which can be used to describe both the behavior of single neurons as well as the dynamics of neural networks Computational neuroscience is often referred to as theoretical neuroscience Translational research and medicine edit Further information Translational research and Translational neuroscience Parasagittal MRI of the head of a patient with benign familial macrocephaly Neurology psychiatry neurosurgery psychosurgery anesthesiology and pain medicine neuropathology neuroradiology ophthalmology otolaryngology clinical neurophysiology addiction medicine and sleep medicine are some medical specialties that specifically address the diseases of the nervous system These terms also refer to clinical disciplines involving diagnosis and treatment of these diseases Neurology works with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS and stroke and their medical treatment Psychiatry focuses on affective behavioral cognitive and perceptual disorders Anesthesiology focuses on perception of pain and pharmacologic alteration of consciousness Neuropathology focuses upon the classification and underlying pathogenic mechanisms of central and peripheral nervous system and muscle diseases with an emphasis on morphologic microscopic and chemically observable alterations Neurosurgery and psychosurgery work primarily with surgical treatment of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems Recently the boundaries between various specialties have blurred as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience For example brain imaging enables objective biological insight into mental illnesses which can lead to faster diagnosis more accurate prognosis and improved monitoring of patient progress over time 38 Integrative neuroscience describes the effort to combine models and information from multiple levels of research to develop a coherent model of the nervous system For example brain imaging coupled with physiological numerical models and theories of fundamental mechanisms may shed light on psychiatric disorders 39 Major branches edit Modern neuroscience education and research activities can be very roughly categorized into the following major branches based on the subject and scale of the system in examination as well as distinct experimental or curricular approaches Individual neuroscientists however often work on questions that span several distinct subfields List of the major branches of neuroscience Branch Description

theories of social processes and behavior Systems neuroscience Systems neuroscience is the study of the function of neural circuits and systems Neuroscience organizations edit The largest professional neuroscience organization is the Society for Neuroscience SFN which is based in the United States but includes many members from other countries Since its founding in 1969 the SFN has grown steadily as of 2010 it recorded 40290 members from 83 different countries 43 Annual meetings held each year in a different American city draw attendance from researchers postdoctoral fellows graduate students and undergraduates as well as educational institutions funding agencies publishers and hundreds of businesses that supply products used in research Other major organizations devoted to neuroscience include the International Brain Research Organization IBRO which holds its meetings in a country from a different part of the world each year and the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies FENS which holds a meeting in a different European city every two years FENS comprises a set of 32 nationallevel organizations including the British Neuroscience Association the German Neuroscience Society Neurowissenschaftliche Gesellschaft and the French Société des Neurosciences The first National Honor Society in Neuroscience Nu Rho Psi was founded in 2006 In 2013 the BRAIN Initiative was announced in the US An International Brain Initiative was created in 2017 44 currently integrated by more than seven nationallevel brain research initiatives US Europe Allen Institute Japan China Australia Canada Korea Israel 45 spanning four continents Public education and outreach edit In addition to conducting traditional research in laboratory settings neuroscientists have also been involved in the promotion of awareness and knowledge about the nervous system among the general public and government officials Such promotions have been done by both individual neuroscientists and large organizations For example individual neuroscientists have promoted neuroscience education among young students by organizing the International Brain Bee which is an academic competition for high school or secondary school students worldwide 46 In the United States large organizations such as the Society for Neuroscience have promoted neuroscience education by developing a primer called Brain Facts 47 collaborating with public school teachers to develop Neuroscience Core Concepts for K12 teachers and students 48 and cosponsoring a campaign with the Dana Foundation called Brain Awareness Week to increase public awareness about the progress and benefits of brain research 49 In Canada the CIHR Canadian National Brain Bee is held annually at McMaster University 50 Neuroscience educators formed Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience FUN in 1992 to share best practices and provide travel awards for undergraduates presenting at Society for Neuroscience meetings 51 Finally neuroscientists have also collaborated with other education experts to study and refine educational techniques to optimize learning among students an emerging field called educational neuroscience 52
