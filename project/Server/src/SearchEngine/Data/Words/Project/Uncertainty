Scientific theory Skepticism Solipsism Theory Truth Uncertainty Related concepts and fundamentals Agnosticism Epistemology Presupposition Probability v t e Situations often arise wherein a decision must be made when the results of each possible choice are uncertain Uncertainty refers to epistemic situations involving imperfect or unknown information It applies to predictions of future events to physical measurements that are already made or to the unknown Uncertainty arises in partially observable andor stochastic environments as well as due to ignorance indolence or both 1 It arises in any

condensing it November 2017 Although the terms are used in various ways among the general public many specialists in decision theory statistics and other quantitative fields have defined uncertainty risk and their measurement as Uncertainty The lack of certainty a state of limited knowledge where it is impossible to exactly describe the existing state a future outcome or more than one possible outcome citation needed Measurement of uncertainty A set of possible states or outcomes where probabilities are assigned to each possible state or outcome this also includes the application of a probability density function to continuous variables 2 Second order uncertainty In statistics and economics secondorder uncertainty is represented in probability density functions over firstorder probabilities 3 4 Opinions in subjective logic 5 carry this type of uncertainty Risk A state of uncertainty where some possible outcomes have an undesired effect or significant loss Measurement of risk A set of measured uncertainties where some possible outcomes are losses and the magnitudes of those losses this also includes loss functions over continuous variables 6 7 8 9 Knightian uncertainty In economics in 1921 Frank Knight distinguished uncertainty from risk with uncertainty being lack of knowledge which is immeasurable and impossible to calculate this is now referred to as Knightian uncertainty mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of risk from which it has never been properly separated The essential fact is that risk means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character and there are farreaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomena depending on which of the two is really present and operating It will appear that a measurable uncertainty or risk proper as we shall use the term is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all Frank Knight 18851972 Risk Uncertainty and Profit 1921 University of Chicago 10 You cannot be certain about uncertainty Frank Knight Other taxonomies of uncertainties and decisions include a broader sense of uncertainty and how it should be approached from an ethics perspective 11 A taxonomy of uncertainty mwparseroutput quoteboxbackgroundcolorF9F9F9border1px solid

knowledge that you have there remain many things whose truth or falsity is not known to you We say that you are uncertain about them You are uncertain to varying degrees about everything in the future much of the past is hidden from you and there is a lot of the present about which you do not have full information Uncertainty is everywhere and you cannot escape from it Dennis Lindley Understanding Uncertainty 2006 For example if it is unknown whether or not it will rain tomorrow then there is a state of uncertainty If probabilities are applied to the possible outcomes using weather forecasts or even just a calibrated probability assessment the uncertainty has been quantified Suppose it is quantified as a 90 chance of sunshine If there is a major costly outdoor event planned for tomorrow then there is a risk since there is a 10 chance of rain and rain would be undesirable Furthermore if this is a business event and 100000 would be lost if it rains then the risk has been quantified a 10 chance of losing 100000 These situations can be made even more realistic by quantifying light rain vs heavy rain the cost of delays vs outright cancellation etc citation needed Some may represent the risk in this example as the expected opportunity loss EOL or the chance of the loss multiplied by the amount of the loss 10 100000 10000 That is useful if the organizer of the event is risk neutral which most people are not Most would be willing to pay a premium to avoid the loss An insurance company for example would compute an EOL as a minimum for any insurance coverage then add onto that other operating costs and profit Since many people are willing to buy insurance for many reasons then clearly the EOL alone is not the perceived value of avoiding the risk Quantitative uses of the terms uncertainty and risk are fairly consistent from fields such as probability theory actuarial science and information theory Some also create new terms without substantially changing the definitions of uncertainty or risk For example surprisal is a variation on uncertainty sometimes used in information theory But outside of the more mathematical uses of the term usage may vary widely In cognitive psychology uncertainty can be real or just a matter of perception such as expectations threats etc Vagueness is a form of uncertainty where the analyst is unable to clearly differentiate between two different classes such as person of average height and tall person This form of vagueness can be modelled by some variation on Zadeh s fuzzy logic or subjective logic Ambiguity is a form of uncertainty where even the possible outcomes have unclear meanings and interpretations The statement He returns from the bank is ambiguous because its interpretation depends on whether the word bank is meant as the side of a river or a financial institution Ambiguity typically arises in situations where multiple analysts or observers have different interpretations of the same statements citation needed Uncertainty may be a consequence of a lack of knowledge of obtainable facts That is there may be uncertainty about whether a new rocket design will work but this uncertainty can be removed with further analysis and experimentation At the subatomic level uncertainty may be a fundamental and unavoidable property of the universe In quantum mechanics the Heisenberg uncertainty principle puts limits on how much an observer can ever know about the position and velocity of a particle This may not just be ignorance of potentially obtainable facts but that there is no fact to be found There is some controversy in physics as to whether such uncertainty is an irreducible property of nature or if there are hidden variables that would describe the state of a particle even more exactly than Heisenbergs uncertainty principle allows citation needed Measurements edit Main article Measurement uncertainty See also Uncertainty quantification and Uncertainty propagation The most commonly used procedure for calculating measurement uncertainty is described in the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement GUM published by ISO A derived work is for example the National Institute for Standards and Technology NIST Technical Note 1297 Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results and the EurachemCitac publication Quantifying Uncertainty in Analytical Measurement The uncertainty of the result of a measurement generally consists of several components The components are regarded as random variables and may be grouped into two categories according to the method used to estimate their numerical values Type A those evaluated by statistical methods Type B those evaluated by other means eg by assigning a probability distribution By propagating the variances of the components through a function relating the components to the measurement result the combined measurement uncertainty is given as the square root of the resulting variance The simplest form is the standard deviation of a repeated observation In metereology physics and engineering the uncertainty or margin of error of a measurement when explicitly stated is given by a range of values likely to enclose the true value This may be denoted by error bars on a graph or by the following notations citation needed measured value uncertainty measured value uncertainty uncertainty measured value uncertainty In the last notation parentheses are the concise notation for the notation For example applying 10 1 2 meters in a scientific or engineering application it could be written 105m or 1050m by convention meaning accurate to within one tenth of a meter or one hundredth The precision is symmetric around the last digit In this case its half a tenth up and half a tenth down so 105 means between 1045 and 1055 Thus it is understood that 105 means 105 005 and 1050 means 1050 0005 also written 10505 and 105005 respectively But if the accuracy is within two tenths the uncertainty is one tenth and it is required to be explicit 105 01 and 1050 001 or 1051 and 10501 The numbers in parentheses apply to the numeral left of themselves and are not part of that number but part of a notation of uncertainty They apply to the least significant digits For instance 1007 94 7 stands for 1007 94 0000 07 while 1007 94 72 stands for 1007 94 0000 72 12 This concise notation is used for example by IUPAC in stating the atomic mass of elements The middle notation is used when the error is not symmetrical about the value for example 34 03 02 This can occur when using a logarithmic scale for example Uncertainty of a measurement can be determined by repeating a measurement to arrive at an estimate of the standard deviation of the values Then any single value has an uncertainty equal to the standard deviation However if the values are averaged then the mean measurement value has a much smaller uncertainty equal to the standard error of the mean which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of measurements This procedure neglects systematic errors however citation needed When the uncertainty represents the standard error of the measurement then about 683 of the time the true value of the measured quantity falls within the stated uncertainty range For example it is likely that for 317 of the atomic mass values given on the list of elements by atomic mass the true value lies outside of the stated range If the width of the interval is doubled then probably only 46 of the true values lie outside the doubled interval and if the width is tripled probably only 03 lie outside These values follow from the properties of the normal distribution and they apply only if the measurement process produces normally distributed errors In that case the quoted standard errors are easily converted to 683 one sigma 954 two sigma or 997 three sigma confidence intervals citation needed In this context uncertainty depends on both the accuracy and precision of the measurement instrument The lower the accuracy and precision of an instrument the larger the measurement uncertainty is Precision is often determined as the standard deviation of the repeated measures of a given value namely using the same method described above to assess measurement uncertainty However this method is correct only when the instrument is accurate When it is inaccurate the uncertainty is larger than the standard deviation of the repeated measures and it appears evident that the uncertainty does not depend only on instrumental precision In the media edit Uncertainty in science and science in general may be interpreted differently in the public sphere than in the scientific community 13 This is due in part to the diversity of the public audience and the tendency for scientists to misunderstand lay audiences and therefore not communicate ideas clearly and effectively 13 One example is explained by the information deficit model Also in the public realm there are often many scientific voices giving input on a single topic 13 For example depending on how an issue is reported in the public sphere discrepancies between outcomes of multiple scientific studies due to methodological differences could be interpreted by the public as a lack of consensus in a situation where a consensus does in fact exist 13 This interpretation may have even been intentionally promoted as scientific uncertainty may be managed to reach certain goals For example climate change deniers took the advice of Frank Luntz to frame global warming as an issue of scientific uncertainty which was a precursor to the conflict frame used by journalists when reporting the issue 14 Indeterminacy can be loosely said to apply to situations in which not all the parameters of the system and their interactions are fully known whereas ignorance refers to situations in which it is not known what is not known 15 These unknowns indeterminacy and ignorance that exist in science are often transformed into uncertainty when reported to the public in order to make issues more manageable since scientific indeterminacy and ignorance are difficult concepts for scientists to convey without losing credibility 13 Conversely uncertainty is often interpreted by the public as ignorance 16 The transformation of indeterminacy and ignorance into uncertainty may be related to the publics misinterpretation of uncertainty as ignorance Journalists may inflate uncertainty making the science seem more uncertain than it really is or downplay uncertainty making the science seem more certain than it really is 17 One way that journalists inflate uncertainty is by describing new research that contradicts past research without providing context for the change 17 Journalists may give scientists with minority views equal weight as scientists with majority views without adequately describing or explaining the state of scientific consensus on the issue 17 In the same vein journalists may give nonscientists the same amount of attention and importance as scientists 17 Journalists may downplay uncertainty by eliminating scientists carefully chosen tentative wording and by losing these caveats the information is skewed and presented as more certain and conclusive than it really is 17 Also stories with a single source or without any context of previous research mean that the subject at hand is presented as more definitive and certain than it is in reality 17 There is often a product over process approach to science journalism that aids too in the downplaying of uncertainty 17 Finally and most notably for this investigation when science is framed by journalists as a triumphant quest uncertainty is erroneously framed as reducible and resolvable 17 Some media routines and organizational factors affect the overstatement of uncertainty other media routines and organizational factors help inflate the certainty of an issue Because the general public in the United States generally trusts scientists when science stories are covered without alarmraising cues from special interest organizations religious groups environmental organizations political factions etc they are often covered in a business related sense in an economicdevelopment frame or a social progress frame 18 The nature of these frames is to downplay or eliminate uncertainty so when economic and scientific promise are focused on early in the issue cycle as has happened with coverage of plant biotechnology and nanotechnology in the United States the matter in question seems more definitive and certain 18 Sometimes stockholders owners or advertising will pressure a media organization to promote the business aspects of a scientific issue and therefore any uncertainty claims which may compromise the business interests are downplayed or eliminated 17 Applications edit Uncertainty is designed into games most notably in gambling where chance is central to play In scientific modelling in which the prediction of future events should be understood to have a range of expected values In optimization uncertainty permits one to describe situations where the user does not have full control on the final outcome of the optimization procedure see scenario optimization and stochastic optimization In weather forecasting it is now commonplace to include data on the degree of uncertainty in a weather forecast Uncertainty or error is used in science and engineering notation Numerical values should only have to be expressed in those digits that are physically meaningful which are referred to as significant figures Uncertainty is involved in every measurement such as measuring a distance a temperature etc the degree depending upon the instrument or technique used to make the measurement Similarly uncertainty is propagated through calculations so that the calculated value has some degree of uncertainty depending upon the uncertainties of the measured values and the equation used in the calculation 19 In physics the Heisenberg uncertainty principle forms the basis of modern quantum mechanics In metrology measurement uncertainty is a central concept quantifying the dispersion one may reasonably attribute to a measurement result Such an uncertainty can also be referred to as a measurement error In daily life measurement uncertainty is often implicit He is 6 feet tall give or take a few inches while for any serious use an explicit statement of the measurement uncertainty is necessary The expected measurement uncertainty of many measuring instruments scales oscilloscopes force gages rulers thermometers etc is often stated in the manufacturers specifications In engineering uncertainty can be used in the context of validation and verification of material modeling 20 Uncertainty has been a common theme in art both as a thematic device see for example the indecision of Hamlet and as a quandary for the artist such as Martin Creed s difficulty with deciding what artworks to make Uncertainty is an important factor in economics According to economist Frank Knight it is different from risk where there is a specific probability assigned to each outcome as when flipping a fair coin Knightian uncertainty involves a situation that has unknown probabilities Investing in financial markets such as the stock market involves Knightian uncertainty when the probability of a rare but catastrophic event is unknown See also edit Applied information economics Certainty
