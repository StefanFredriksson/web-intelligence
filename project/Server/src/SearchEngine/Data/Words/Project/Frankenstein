Text Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus at Wikisource Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus is a novel written by English author Mary Shelley 17971851 that tells the story of Victor Frankenstein a young scientist who creates a hideous sapient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment Shelley started writing the story when she was 18 and the first edition was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818 when she was 20 2 Her name first appeared on the second edition published in 1823 Shelley travelled through Europe in 1815 along the river Rhine in Germany stopping in Gernsheim 17 kilometres 11mi away from Frankenstein Castle where two centuries before an alchemist engaged in experiments 3 4 5 She then journeyed to the region of Geneva Switzerland where much of the story takes place The topic of galvanism and occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions particularly her lover and future husband Percy B Shelley Mary Percy and Lord Byron had a competition to see who could write the best horror story After thinking for days Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made inspiring the novel 6 Frankenstein is infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement Brian Aldiss has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story because in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction the central character makes a deliberate decision and turns to modern experiments in the laboratory to achieve fantastic results 7 It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories films and plays Since the novels publication the name Frankenstein has often been used to refer to the monster itself 8 9 10 In the novel Frankensteins creation is identified by words such as creature monster daemon wretch abortion fiend and it Speaking to Victor Frankenstein the monster says I ought to be thy Adam but I am rather the fallen angel which ties to Lucifer in Paradise Lost which the monster reads and which relates to the disobedience of

century as the letters dates are given as 17 In the story following the letters by Walton the readers find that Victor Frankenstein creates a monster that brings tragedy to his life Captain Waltons introductory frame narrative edit The novel Frankenstein is written in epistolary form documenting a fictional correspondence between Captain Robert Walton and his sister Margaret Walton Saville Walton is a failed writer and captain who sets out to explore the North Pole and expand his scientific knowledge in hopes of achieving fame During the voyage the crew spots a dog sled driven by a gigantic figure A few hours later the crew rescues a nearly frozen and emaciated man named Victor Frankenstein Frankenstein has been in pursuit of the gigantic man observed by Waltons crew Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion he sees in Walton the same obsession that has destroyed him and recounts a story of his lifes miseries to Walton as a warning The recounted story serves as the frame for Frankensteins narrative Victor Frankensteins narrative edit Victor begins by telling of his childhood Born in Naples Italy into a wealthy Genevan family Victor and his brothers Ernest and William all three being sons of Alphonse Frankenstein by the former Caroline Beaufort are encouraged to seek a greater understanding of the world through chemistry As a young boy Victor is obsessed with studying outdated theories that focus on simulating natural wonders When Victor is five years old his parents adopt Elizabeth Lavenza the orphaned daughter of an expropriated Italian nobleman with whom Victor allegedly later falls in love During this period Victors parents Alphonse and Caroline take in yet another orphan Justine Moritz who becomes Williams nanny Weeks before he leaves for the University of Ingolstadt in Germany his mother dies of scarlet fever Victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with the grief At the university he excels at chemistry and other sciences soon developing a secret technique to impart life to nonliving matter Eventually he undertakes the creation of a humanoid but due to the difficulty in replicating the minute parts of the human body Victor makes the Creature tall about 8 feet 24m in height and proportionally large Despite Victors selecting its features as beautiful upon animation the creature is instead hideous with watery white eyes and yellow skin that barely conceals the muscles and blood vessels underneath Repulsed by his work Victor flees when it awakens While wandering the streets he meets his childhood friend Henry Clerval and takes Henry back to his apartment fearful of Henrys reaction if he sees the monster However the Creature has escaped Victor falls ill from the experience and is nursed back to health by Henry After a fourmonth recovery he receives a letter from his father notifying him of the murder of his brother William Upon arriving in Geneva Victor sees the Creature near the crime scene and climbing a mountain leading him to believe his creation is responsible Justine Moritz Williams nanny is convicted of the crime after Williams locket which had contained a miniature portrait of Caroline is found in her pocket Victor is helpless to stop her from being hanged as he knows no one would believe his story Ravaged by grief and guilt Victor retreats into the mountains The Creature finds him and pleads for Victor to hear his tale The Creatures narrative edit Intelligent and articulate the Creature relates his first days of life living alone in the wilderness and finding that people were afraid of and hated him due to his appearance which led him to fear and hide from them While living in an abandoned structure connected to a cottage he grew fond of the poor family living there and discreetly collected firewood for them Secretly living among the family for months the Creature learned to speak by listening to them and he taught himself to read after discovering a lost satchel of books in the woods When he saw his reflection in a pool he realized his physical appearance was hideous and it terrified him as it terrifies normal humans Nevertheless he approached the family in hopes of becoming their friend Initially he was able to befriend the blind father figure of the family but the rest of them were frightened and they all fled their home resulting in the Creature leaving disappointed He traveled to Victors family estate using details from Victors journal murdered William and framed Justine The Creature demands that Victor create a female companion like himself He argues that as a living being he has a right to happiness The Creature promises that he and his mate will vanish into the South American wilderness never to reappear if Victor grants his request Should Victor refuse his request The Creature also threatens to kill Victors remaining friends and loved ones and not stop until he completely ruins him Fearing for his family Victor reluctantly agrees The Creature says he will watch over Victors progress Victor Frankensteins narrative resumes edit Clerval accompanies him to England but they separate at Victors insistence at Perth Scotland Victor suspects that the Creature is following him Working on the female creature on the Orkney Islands he is plagued by premonitions of disaster such as the female hating the Creature or becoming more evil than him but more particularly the two creatures might lead to the breeding of a race that could plague mankind He tears apart the unfinished female creature after he sees the Creature who had indeed followed Victor watching through a window The Creature later confronts and tries to threaten Victor into working again but Victor is convinced that the Creature is evil and that its mate would be evil as well and the pair would threaten all humanity Victor destroys his work and the Creature vows that he will be with him on his wedding night Victor interprets this as a threat upon his life believing that the Creature will kill him after he finally becomes happy Victor sails out to sea to dispose of his instruments falls asleep in the boat is unable to return to shore because of changes in the winds and ends up being blown to the Irish coast When Victor lands in Ireland he is soon imprisoned for Clervals murder as the Creature had strangled Clerval to death and left the corpse to be found where his creator had arrived causing the latter to suffer another mental breakdown in prison After being acquitted Victor returns home with his father who has restored to Elizabeth some of her fathers fortune In Geneva Victor is about to marry Elizabeth and prepares to fight the Creature to the death arming himself with pistols and a dagger The night following their wedding Victor asks Elizabeth to stay in her room while he looks for the fiend While Victor searches the house and grounds the Creature strangles Elizabeth to death From the window Victor sees the Creature who tauntingly points at Elizabeths corpse Victor tries to shoot him but the Creature escapes After Victor gets back to Geneva Victors father weakened by age and by the death of his precious Elizabeth dies a few days later Seeking revenge Victor pursues the Creature to the North Pole but collapses from exhaustion and hypothermia before he can find his quarry Captain Waltons conclusion edit At the end of Victors narrative Captain Walton resumes the telling of the story closing the frame around Victors recounting A few days after the Creature vanished the ship becomes trapped in pack ice and multiple crewmen die in the cold before the rest of Waltons crew insists on returning south once it is freed Upon hearing and angered by the crews pleas to their captain Victor lectures them with a powerful speech it is hardship not comfort and easiness that defines a glorious undertaking such as theirs he urges them to be men not cowards The ship is freed and Walton owing it to the will of his men albeit regretfully decides to return South Victor even though in very weak condition states that he will go on by himself He is adamant that the creature die Victor dies shortly thereafter telling Walton with his last words to seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition Walton discovers the Creature on his ship mourning over Victors body The Creature tells Walton that Victors death has not brought him peace rather his crimes have left him completely alone The Creature vows to kill himself so that no others will ever know of his existence Walton watches as the Creature drifts away on an ice raft that is soon lost in darkness and distance never to be seen again Authors background edit Mary Shelley had a tragic life from the beginning Shelleys mother Mary Wollstonecraft died from infection shortly after giving birth to her Shelley grew a close attachment to her father having never known her mother Her father William Godwin hired a nurse briefly to care for her and her half sister before he ended up remarrying Shelleys stepmother did not like the close bond she had with her father which caused friction and Godwin to then favor his other two daughters and sons Her father was a famous author of the time and her education was of great importance though not formal Shelley grew up surrounded by her fathers friends writers and persons of political importance that gathered often at the family home This inspired her authorship at an early age Shelley met Percy Bysshe Shelley who later became her husband at the age of sixteen while he was visiting with her father Godwin did not agree with the relationship of his daughter to an older married but separated man so they fled to France along with her stepsister Claire Clairmont Later Shelley gave birth and lost their first child Over eight years she would endure a similar pattern of pregnancy and loss one hemorrhaging occurring until Percy placed her upon ice to cease the bleeding 11 Mary and Percys trip with Claire to visit her lover Lord Byron in Geneva during the summer of 1816 began the friendship amongst the two couples in which Byron suggested they have a competition of writing the best ghost story Historians suggest an affair occurred too even that paternity of one Shelley child may have been a Byron 11 Mary was eighteen years old when she won the contest with her creation of Frankenstein 12 13 Literary influences edit Shelley was heavily influenced by both of her parents works Her father was famous for Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and her mother famous for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman Her fathers novels also influenced her writing of Frankenstein These novels included Things as They Are or The Adventures of Caleb Williams St Leon and Fleetwood All of these books were set in Switzerland similar to the setting in Frankenstein Some major themes of social affections and the renewal of life that appear in Shelleys novel stem from these works she had in her possession Other literary influences that appear in Frankenstein are Pygmalion et Galatée by Mme de Genlis and Ovid with the use of an individual lacking intelligence and those individuals identifying the problems with society 14 Ovid also inspires the use of Prometheus in Shelleys title 15 Percy and Byrons discussion on life and death surrounded many scientific geniuses of the time They discussed ideas from Erasmus Darwin and the experiments from Luigi Galvani Mary joined these conversations and the ideas of Darwin and Galvani were both present in her novel The horrors of not being able to write a story for the contest and her hard life also influenced the themes within Frankenstein The themes of loss guilt and the consequences of defying nature present in the novel all developed from Mary Shelleys own life The loss of her mother the relationship with her father and the death of her first child created the monster and his separation from parental guidance In a 1965 issue of The Journal of Religion and Health a psychologist proposed guilt stemmed from her not feeling good enough for Percy because of the loss of their child 13 Characters edit Victor Frankenstein

templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 How I then a young girl came to think of and to dilate upon so very hideous an idea Mary Shelley 16 During the rainy summer of 1816 the Year Without a Summer the world was locked in a long cold volcanic winter caused by the eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815 17 Mary Shelley aged 18 and her lover and later husband Percy Bysshe Shelley visited Lord Byron at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva in Switzerland The weather was consistently too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned so the group retired indoors until dawn Sitting around a log fire at Byrons villa the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the book Fantasmagoriana 18 then Byron proposed that they each write a ghost story 19 Unable to think of a story young Mary became anxious Have you thought of a story I was asked each morning and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative 20 During one evening in the middle of summer the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life Perhaps a corpse would be reanimated Mary noted galvanism had given token of such things 21 It was after midnight before they retired and unable to sleep she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the grim terrors of her waking dream 22 I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out and then on the working of some powerful engine show signs of life and stir with an uneasy half vital motion Frightful must it be for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world 23 In September 2011 astronomer Donald Olson after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars concluded that her waking dream took place between 2 am and 3 am on 16 June 1816 several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story 24 She began writing what she assumed would be a short story With Percy Shelleys encouragement she expanded the tale into a fullfledged novel 25 She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment when I first stepped out from childhood into life 26 Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her halfsister Fanny 27 This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelleys work Shelleys first child died in infancy and when she began composing Frankenstein in 1816 she was likely nursing her second child who would also be dead at Frankenstein s publication 28 Byron managed to write just a fragment based on the vampire legends he heard while travelling the Balkans and from this John Polidori created The Vampyre 1819 the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre Thus two seminal horror tales originated from the conclave The group talked about Enlightenment and CounterEnlightenment ideas as well Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly however she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society Bennett 3642 29 Shelley wrote much of the book while residing in a lodging house in the centre of Bath in 1816 30 Shelleys manuscripts for the first threevolume edition in 1818 written 18161817 as well as the fair copy for her publisher are now housed in the Bodleian Library in Oxford The Bodleian acquired the papers in 2004 and they belong now to the Abinger Collection 31 32 In 2008 the Bodleian published a new edition of Frankenstein edited by Charles E Robinson that contains comparisons of Mary Shelleys original text with Percy Shelleys additions and interventions alongside 33 Publication edit Mary Shelley by Richard Rothwell 184041 Shelley completed her writing in AprilMay 1817 and Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus was published on 1 January 1818 34 by the small London publishing house Lackington Hughes Harding Mavor Jones 35 36 It was issued anonymously with a preface written for Mary by Percy Bysshe Shelley and with a dedication to philosopher William Godwin her father It was published in an edition of just 500 copies in three volumes the standard tripledecker format for 19thcentury first editions A variety of different editions The second edition of Frankenstein was published on 11 August 1823 in two volumes by G and W B Whittaker following the success of the stage play Presumption or the Fate of Frankenstein by Richard Brinsley Peake 37 This edition credited Mary Shelley as the books author on its title page On 31 October 1831 the first popular edition in onevolume appeared published by Henry Colburn Richard Bentley 38 This edition was heavily revised by Mary Shelley partially to make the story less radical It included a lengthy new preface by the author presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story This edition is the one most widely published and read now although a few editions follow the 1818 text 39 Some scholars prefer the original version arguing that it preserves the spirit of Mary Shelleys vision see Anne K Mellors Choosing a Text of Frankenstein to Teach in the W W Norton Critical edition Frankenstein and the Monster edit The Creature edit Main article Frankensteins monster An English editorial cartoonist conceives the Irish Fenian movement as akin to Frankensteins creature in the wake of the Phoenix Park murders in an 1882 issue of Punch 40 Part of Frankensteins rejection of his creation is the fact that he does not give it a name which causes a lack of identity Instead it is referred to by words such as wretch monster creature demon devil fiend and it When Frankenstein converses with the creature in Chapter 10 he addresses it as vile insect abhorred monster fiend wretched devil and abhorred devil During a telling of Frankenstein Shelley referred to the creature as Adam 41 failed verification Shelley was referring to the first man in the Garden of Eden as in her epigraph Did I request thee Maker from my clay To mould Me man Did I solicit thee From darkness to promote me John Milton Paradise Lost X 74345 Although the creature would be described in later works as a composite of whole body parts grafted together from cadavers and reanimated by the use of electricity this description is not consistent with Shelleys work both the use of electricity and the cobbledtogether image of Frankensteins monster were more the result of James Whale s popular 1931 film adaptation of the story and other early motionpicture works based upon the creature In Shelleys original work Dr Frankenstein discovers a previously unknown but elemental principle of life and that insight allows him to develop a method to imbue vitality into inanimate matter though the exact nature of the process is left largely ambiguous After a great deal of hesitation in exercising this power Frankenstein spends two years painstakingly constructing the creatures proportionally large body one anatomical feature at a time from raw materials supplied by the dissecting room and the slaughterhouse which he then brings to life using his unspecified process The creature has often been mistakenly called Frankenstein In 1908 one author said It is strange to note how wellnigh universally the term Frankenstein is misused even by intelligent people as describing some hideous monster 42 Edith Wharton s The Reef 1916 describes an unruly child as an infant Frankenstein 43 David Lindsay s The Bridal Ornament published in The Rover 12 June 1844 mentioned the maker of poor Frankenstein After the release of Whales cinematic Frankenstein the public at large began speaking of the creature itself as Frankenstein This also occurs in Frankenstein films including Bride of Frankenstein 1935 and several subsequent films as well as in film titles such as Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein Furthermore the 1939 film Son of Frankenstein introduced an evil laboratory assistant Ygor Bela Lugosi who never existed in the original narrative Victor Frankensteins name edit Mary Shelley maintained that she derived the name Frankenstein from a dreamvision Despite her public claims of originality a number of other sources have been suggested as Shelleys actual inspiration The German name Frankenstein means stone of the Franks and is associated with various places in Germany including Frankenstein Castle Burg Frankenstein in Darmstadt Hesse and Frankenstein Castle in Frankenstein a town in the Palatinate There is also a castle called Frankenstein in Bad Salzungen Thuringia and a municipality called Frankenstein in Saxony Until 1945 Ząbkowice Śląskie now a city in Lower Silesian Voivodeship Poland but was mainly populated by Germans and was the site of a scandal involving gravediggers in 1606 which has been suggested as an inspiration to the author 44 Finally the name is borne by the aristocratic House of Franckenstein from Franconia Radu Florescu argues that Mary and Percy Shelley visited Frankenstein Castle near Darmstadt in 1814 during their return to England from their elopement to Switzerland A notorious alchemist Conrad Dippel had experimented with human bodies there and Florescu reasons that Mary suppressed mention of her visit in order to maintain her public claim of originality 45 A literary essay by AJ Day supports Florescus position that Mary Shelley knew of and visited Frankenstein Castle before writing her debut novel 46 Day includes details of an alleged description of the Frankenstein castle that exists in Mary Shelleys lost journals According to Jörg Heléne the lost journals as well as Florescus claims cannot be verified 47 A possible interpretation of the name Victor is derived from Paradise Lost by John Milton a great influence on Shelley a quotation from Paradise Lost is on the opening page of Frankenstein and Shelley writes the monster reads it in the novel 48 49 Milton frequently refers to God as the Victor in Paradise Lost and Shelley refers to Victor as playing God by creating life In addition Shelleys portrayal of the monster owes much to the character of Satan in Paradise Lost and the monster says in the story after reading the epic poem that he empathizes with Satans role There are many similarities between Victor and Percy Shelley Marys husband Victor was a pen name of Percy Shelleys in the collection of poetry he wrote with his sister Elizabeth Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire 50 There is speculation that one of Mary Shelleys models for Victor Frankenstein was Percy who at Eton had experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions and whose rooms at Oxford were filled with scientific equipment 51 Percy Shelley was the firstborn son of a wealthy country squire with strong political connections and a descendant of Sir Bysshe Shelley 1st Baronet of Castle Goring and Richard Fitzalan 10th Earl of Arundel 52 Victors family is one of the most distinguished of that republic and his ancestors were counselors and syndics Percy had a sister named Elizabeth Victor had an adopted sister named Elizabeth On 22 February 1815 Mary Shelley gave birth to a baby two months prematurely and the baby died two weeks later Percy did not care about the condition of this premature infant and left with Claire Marys stepsister for a lurid affair 53 When Victor saw the creature come to life he fled the apartment though the newborn creature approached him as a child would a parent The question of Victors responsibility to the creature is one of the main themes of Shelleys book Modern Prometheus edit The Modern Prometheus is the novels subtitle though modern editions now drop it only mentioning it in introduction 54 Prometheus in versions of Greek mythology was the Titan who created mankind in the image of the gods that could have a spirit breathed into it at the behest of Zeus 55 Prometheus then taught man to hunt but after he tricked Zeus into accepting poorquality offerings from humans Zeus kept fire from mankind Prometheus took back the fire from Zeus to give to man When Zeus discovered this he sentenced Prometheus to be eternally punished by fixing him to a rock of Caucasus where each day an eagle would peck out his liver only for the liver to regrow the next day because of his immortality as a god As a Pythagorean or believer in Abstinence of Animal Food as a Moral Duty by Joseph Ritsons 56 Mary Shelley saw Prometheus not as a hero but rather as something of a devil and blamed him for bringing fire to man and thereby seducing the human race to the vice of eating meat 57 Percy wrote several essays on what would become known as vegetarianism including The Vindication of the Natural Diet 56 In 1910 Edison Studios released the first motionpicture adaptation of Shelleys story The Titan in the Greek mythology of Prometheus parallels Victor Frankenstein Victors work by creating man by new means reflects the same innovative work of the Titan in creating humans Byron was particularly attached to the play Prometheus Bound by Aeschylus and Percy Shelley would soon write his own Prometheus Unbound 1820 The term Modern Prometheus was actually coined by Immanuel Kant in reference to Benjamin Franklin and his experiments with electricity 58 Shelleys sources edit Shelley incorporated a number of different sources into her work one of which was the Promethean myth from Ovid The influence of John Milton s Paradise Lost and Samuel Taylor Coleridge s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner are also clearly evident within the novel Mary is likely to have acquired some ideas for Frankensteins character from Humphry Davy s book Elements of Chemical Philosophy in which he had written that science has bestowed upon man powers which may be called creative which have enabled him to change and modify the beings around him References to the French Revolution run through the novel a possible source may lie in FrançoisFélix Nogaret fr s Le Miroir des événemens actuels ou la Belle au plus offrant 1790 a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frankésteïn who creates a lifesized automaton 59 Percy Bysshe Shelleys 1816 poem Mutability is also quoted and its theme of the role of the subconscious is discussed in prose The Creature also quotes a passage of the poem His name has never appeared as the author of the poem although other poets are cited by name in the novel implying that Mary wrote the poem and developed the psychological ideas Another potential reason is to conceal his contributions to the novel Many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then popular natural philosophers now called physical scientists with Shelleys work on account of several notable similarities Two of the most noted natural philosophers among Shelleys contemporaries were Giovanni Aldini who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bioelectric Galvanism in London 60 and Johann Konrad Dippel who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans While Shelley was aware of both these men and their activities she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes Reception edit Illustration by Theodor von Holst from the frontispiece of the 1831 edition 61 Frankenstein has been both well received and disregarded since its anonymous publication in 1818 Critical reviews of that time demonstrate these two views along with confused speculation as to the identity of the author The Belle Assemblée described the novel as very bold fiction 139 The Quarterly Review stated that the author has the power of both conception and language 185 Sir Walter Scott writing in Blackwoods Edinburgh Magazine congratulated the authors original genius and happy power of expression 620 although he is less convinced about the way in which the monster gains knowledge about the world and language 62 The Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Miscellany hoped to see more productions from this author 253 On the other hand the Quarterly Review described it a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity 63 In two other reviews where the author is known as the daughter of William Godwin the criticism of the novel makes reference to the feminine nature of Mary Shelley The British Critic attacks the novels flaws as the fault of the author The writer of it is we understand a female this is an aggravation of that which is the prevailing fault of the novel but if our authoress can forget the gentleness of her sex it is no reason why we should and we shall therefore dismiss the novel without further comment 438 The Literary Panorama and National Register attacks the novel as a feeble imitation of Mr Godwins novels produced by the daughter of a celebrated living novelist 414 Despite the reviews Frankenstein achieved an almost immediate popular success It became widely known especially through melodramatic theatrical adaptationsMary Shelley saw a production of Presumption or The Fate of Frankenstein a play by Richard Brinsley Peake in 1823 A French translation appeared as early as 1821 Frankenstein ou le Prométhée Moderne translated by Jules Saladin Critical reception of Frankenstein has been largely positive since the mid20th century 64 Major critics such as M A Goldberg and Harold Bloom have praised the aesthetic and moral relevance of the novel 65 although there are also critics such as Germaine Greer who criticized the novel as terrible due to technical and narrative defects such as it featuring three narrators that speak in the same way 66 In more recent years the novel has become a popular subject for psychoanalytic and feminist criticism Lawrence Lipking states Even the Lacanian subgroup of psychoanalytic criticism for instance has produced at least half a dozen discrete readings of the novel 67 Frankenstein is one of Five Books most recommended books with literary scholars psychologists novelists and historians citing it as an influential text 68 The novel today is generally considered to be a landmark work of romantic and gothic literature as well as science fiction 69 Film director Guillermo del Toro describes Frankenstein as the quintessential teenage book adding You dont belong You were brought to this world by people that dont care for you and you are thrown into a world of pain and suffering and tears and hunger Its an amazing book written by a teenage girl Its mindblowing 70 Professor of philosophy Patricia MacCormack says the creature brought to life by Victor Frankenstein addresses the most fundamental human questions Its the idea of asking your maker what your purpose is Why are we here what can we do 70 On November 5 2019 the BBC News listed Frankenstein on its list of the 100 most influential novels 71 Derivative works edit There are numerous
