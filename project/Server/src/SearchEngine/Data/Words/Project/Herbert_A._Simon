Nicholas Taleb Herbert Alexander Simon June 15 1916 February 9 2001 was an American economist political scientist and cognitive psychologist whose primary research interest was decisionmaking within organizations and is best known for the theories of bounded rationality and satisficing 5 He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978 and the Turing Award in 1975 6 7 His research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science computer science public administration management and political science 8 He was at Carnegie Mellon University for most of his career from 1949 to 2001 9 Notably Simon was among the pioneers of several modernday scientific domains such as artificial intelligence information processing decisionmaking problemsolving organization theory and complex systems He was among the earliest to analyze the architecture of complexity and to propose a preferential attachment mechanism to explain power law distributions 10 11

was born in Milwaukee Wisconsin on June 15 1916 His father Arthur Simon 18811948 was a Jewish 12 electrical engineer who had come to the United States from Germany in 1903 after earning his engineering degree from the Technische Hochschule of Darmstadt 13 An inventor who was granted several dozen patents his father also was an independent patent attorney 14 His mother Edna Marguerite Merkel was an accomplished pianist whose ancestors had come from Prague and Cologne 15 His European ancestors had been piano makers goldsmiths and vintners Simons father was Jewish and his mother came from a family with Jewish Lutheran and Catholic backgrounds 15 Simon called himself an atheist 16 Simon was educated in the Milwaukee public school system where he developed an interest in science He found schoolwork to be interesting but rather easy Unlike many children Simon was exposed to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically at a relatively young age due to the influence of his mothers younger brother Harold Merkel who had studied economics at the University of WisconsinMadison under John R Commons Through his uncles books on economics and psychology Simon discovered the social sciences Among his earliest influences Simon has cited Richard Ely s economics textbook Norman Angell s The Great Illusion and Henry George s Progress and Poverty At that time Simon argued from conviction rather than cussedness in favor of Georges controversial single tax on land rents 17 In 1933 Simon entered the University of Chicago and following those early influences he studied the social sciences and mathematics He was interested in biology but chose not to study it because of his colorblindness and awkwardness in the laboratory 18 He chose instead to focus on political science and economics His most important mentor was Henry Schultz an econometrician and mathematical economist 2 Simon received both his BA 1936 and his PhD 1943 in political science from the University of Chicago where he studied under Harold Lasswell Nicolas Rashevsky Rudolf Carnap Henry Schultz and Charles Edward Merriam 19 After enrolling in a course on Measuring Municipal Governments Simon was invited to be a research assistant for Clarence Ridley with whom he coauthored Measuring Municipal Activities in 1938 20 Eventually his studies led him to the field of organizational decisionmaking which would become the subject of his doctoral dissertation Career and research edit After graduating with his undergraduate degree Simon obtained a research assistantship in municipal administration which turned into a directorship at the University of California Berkeley From 1942 to 1949 Simon was a professor of political science and also served as department chairman at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago There he began participating in the seminars held by the staff of the Cowles Commission who at that time included Trygve Haavelmo Jacob Marschak and Tjalling Koopmans He thus began an indepth study of economics in the area of institutionalism Marschak brought Simon in to assist in the study he was currently undertaking with Sam Schurr of the prospective economic effects of atomic energy 21 From 1949 to 2001 Simon was a faculty at Carnegie Mellon In 1949 Simon became a professor of administration and chairman of the Department of Industrial Management at Carnegie Tech later to become Carnegie Mellon University Simon later also 22 taught psychology and computer science in the same university 21 occasionally visiting other universities 23 Publications edit Seeking to replace the highly simplified classical approach to economic modeling Simon became best known for his theory of corporate decision in his book Administrative Behavior In this book he based his concepts with an approach that recognized multiple factors that contribute to decision making His organization and administration interest allowed him to not only serve three times as a university department chairman but he also played a big part in the creation of the Economic Cooperation Administration in 1948 administrative team that administered aid to the Marshall Plan for the US government serving on President Lyndon Johnson s Science Advisory Committee and also the National Academy of Science 21 Simon has made a great number of contributions to both economic analysis and applications Because of this his work can be found in a number of economic literary works making contributions to areas such as mathematical economics including theorem human rationality behavioral study of firms theory of casual ordering and the analysis of the parameter identification problem in econometrics 24 Decisionmaking edit Main article Administrative Behavior Simons three stages in Rational Decision Making Intelligence Design Choice IDC Administrative Behavior 25 first published in 1947 and updated across the years was based on Simons doctoral dissertation 26 It served as the foundation for his lifes work The centerpiece of this book is the behavioral and cognitive processes of humans making rational choices that is decisions By his definition an operational administrative decision should be correct and efficient and it must be practical to implement with a set of coordinated means 26 Simon recognized that a theory of administration is largely a theory of human decision making and as such must be based on both economics and on psychology He states mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 If there were no limits to human rationality administrative theory would be barren It would consist of the single precept Always select that alternative among those available which will lead to the most complete achievement of your goals 26 p xxviii Contrary to the homo economicus stereotype Simon argued that alternatives and consequences may be partly known and means and ends imperfectly differentiated incompletely related or poorly detailed 26 Simon defined the task of rational decision making is to select the alternative that results in the more preferred set of all the possible consequences Correctness of administrative decisions was thus measured by Adequacy of achieving the desired objective Efficiency with which the result was obtained The task of choice was divided into three required steps 27 Identifying and listing all the alternatives Determining all consequences resulting from each of the alternatives Comparing the accuracy and efficiency of each of these sets of consequences Any given individual or organization attempting to implement this model in a real situation would be unable to comply with the three requirements Simon argued that knowledge of all alternatives or all consequences that follow from each alternative is impossible in many realistic cases 25 Simon attempted to determine the techniques andor behavioral processes that a person or organization could bring to bear to achieve approximately the best result given limits on rational decision making 26 Simon writes The human being striving for rationality and restricted within the limits of his knowledge has developed some working procedures that partially overcome these difficulties These procedures consist in assuming that he can isolate from the rest of the world a closed system containing a limited number of variables and a limited range of consequences 28 Simon therefore describes work in terms of an economic framework conditioned on human cognitive limitations Economic man and Administrative man Administrative Behavior addresses a wide range of human behaviors cognitive abilities management techniques personnel policies training goals and procedures specialized roles criteria for evaluation of accuracy and efficiency and all of the ramifications of communication processes Simon is particularly interested in how these factors influence the making of decisions both directly and indirectly citation needed Simon argued that the two outcomes of a choice require monitoring and that many members of the organization would be expected to focus on adequacy but that administrative management must pay particular attention to the efficiency with which the desired result was obtained citation needed Simon followed Chester Barnard who pointed out that the decisions that an individual makes as a member of an organization are quite distinct from his personal decisions 29 Personal choices may be determined whether an individual joins a particular organization and continue to be made in his or her extraorganizational private life As a member of an organization however that individual makes decisions not in relationship to personal needs and results but in an impersonal sense as part of the organizational intent purpose and effect Organizational inducements rewards and sanctions are all designed to form strengthen and maintain this identification citation needed Simon 26 saw two universal elements of human social behavior as key to creating the possibility of organizational behavior in human individuals Authority addressed in Chapter VIIThe Role of Authority and in Loyalties and Identification Addressed in Chapter X Loyalties and Organizational Identification Authority is a wellstudied primary mark of organizational behavior straightforwardly defined in the organizational context as the ability and right of an individual of higher rank to guide the decisions of an individual of lower rank The actions attitudes and relationships of the dominant and subordinate individuals constitute components of role behavior that may vary widely in form style and content but do not vary in the expectation of obedience by the one of superior status and willingness to obey from the subordinate citation needed Loyalty was defined by Simon as the process whereby the individual substitutes organizational objectives service objectives or conservation objectives for his own aims as the valueindices which determine his organizational decisions 30 This entailed evaluating alternative choices in terms of their consequences for the group rather than only for onself or ones family 31 Decisions can be complex admixtures of facts and values Information about facts especially empiricallyproven facts or facts derived from specialized experience are more easily transmitted in the exercise of authority than are the expressions of values Simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values Following Lasswell 32 he states that a person identifies himself with a group when in making a decision he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group 33 A person may identify himself with any number of social geographic economic racial religious familial educational gender political and sports groups Indeed the number and variety are unlimited The fundamental problem for organizations is to recognize that personal and group identifications may either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization A specific organization has to determine deliberately and specify in appropriate detail and clear language its own goals objectives means ends and values citation needed Simon has been critical of traditional economics elementary understanding of decisionmaking and argues it is too quick to build an idealistic unrealistic picture of the decisionmaking process and then prescribe on the basis of such unrealistic picture 34 His contributions to research in the area of administrative decisionmaking have become increasingly mainstream in the business community citation needed Artificial intelligence edit Simon was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence creating with Allen Newell the Logic Theory Machine 1956 and the General Problem Solver GPS 1957 programs GPS may possibly be the first method developed for separating problem solving strategy from information about particular problems Both programs were developed using the Information Processing Language IPL 1956 developed by Newell Cliff Shaw and Simon Donald Knuth mentions the development of list processing in IPL with the linked list originally called NSS memory for its inventors 35 In 1957 Simon predicted that computer chess would surpass human chess abilities within ten years when in reality that transition took about forty years 36 In the early 1960s psychologist Ulric Neisser asserted that while machines are capable of replicating cold cognition behaviors such as reasoning planning perceiving and deciding they would never be able to replicate hot cognition behaviors such as pain pleasure desire and other emotions Simon responded to Neissers views in 1963 by writing a paper on emotional cognition 37 which he updated in 1967 and published in Psychological Review 38 Simons work on emotional cognition was largely ignored by the artificial intelligence research community for several years but subsequent work on emotions by Sloman and Picard helped refocus attention on Simons paper and eventually made it highly influential on the topic citation needed Simon also collaborated with James G March on several works in organization theory 8 With Allen Newell Simon developed a theory for the simulation of human problem solving behavior using production rules 39 The study of human problem solving required new kinds of human measurements and with Anders Ericsson Simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis 40 Simon was interested in the role of knowledge in expertise He said that to become an expert on a topic required about ten years of experience and he and colleagues estimated that expertise was the result of learning roughly 50000 chunks of information A chess expert was said to have learned about 50000 chunks or chess position patterns 41 He was awarded the ACM Turing Award along with Allen Newell in 1975 In joint scientific efforts extending over twenty years initially in collaboration with J C Cliff Shaw at the RAND Corporation and subsequentially sic with numerous faculty and student colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University they have made basic contributions to artificial intelligence the psychology of human cognition and list processing 42 Psychology edit Simon was interested in how humans learn and with Edward Feigenbaum he developed the EPAM Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer theory one of the first theories of learning to be implemented as a computer program EPAM was able to explain a large number of phenomena in the field of verbal learning 43 Later versions of the model were applied to concept formation and the acquisition of expertise With Fernand Gobet he has expanded the EPAM theory into the CHREST computational model 44 The theory explains how simple chunks of information form the building blocks of schemata which are more complex structures CHREST has been used predominantly to simulate aspects of chess expertise citation needed Sociology and economics edit Simon has been credited for revolutionary changes in microeconomics He is responsible for the concept of organizational decisionmaking as it is known today He also was the first to discuss this concept in terms of uncertainty ie it is impossible to have perfect and complete information at any given time to make a decision While this notion was not entirely new Simon is best known for its origination It was in this area that he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978 45 At the Cowles Commission Simons main goal was to link economic theory to mathematics and statistics His main contributions were to the fields of general equilibrium and econometrics He was greatly influenced by the marginalist debate that began in the 1930s The popular work of the time argued that it was not apparent empirically that entrepreneurs needed to follow the marginalist principles of profitmaximizationcostminimization in running organizations The argument went on to note that profit maximization was not accomplished in part because of the lack of complete information In decisionmaking Simon believed that agents face uncertainty about the future and costs in acquiring information in the present These factors limit the extent to which agents may make a fully rational decision thus they possess only bounded rationality and must make decisions by satisficing or choosing that which might not be optimal but which will make them happy enough Bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics It is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision making process influences decision Theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory Further Simon emphasized that psychologists invoke a procedural definition of rationality whereas economists employ a substantive definition Gustavos Barros argued that the procedural rationality concept does not have a significant presence in the economics field and has never had nearly as much weight as the concept of bounded rationality 46 However in an earlier article Bhargava 1997 noted the importance of Simons arguments and emphasized that there are several applications of the procedural definition of rationality in econometric analyses of data on health In particular economists should employ auxiliary assumptions that reflect the knowledge in the relevant biomedical fields and guide the specification of econometric models for health outcomes Simon was also known for his research on industrial organization He determined that the internal organization of firms and the external business decisions thereof did not conform to the neoclassical theories of rational decisionmaking Simon wrote many articles on the topic over the course of his life mainly focusing on the issue of decisionmaking within the behavior of what he termed bounded rationality Rational behavior in economics means that individuals maximize their utility function under the constraints they face eg their budget constraint limited choices in pursuit of their selfinterest This is reflected in the theory of subjective expected utility The term bounded rationality is used to designate rational choice that takes into account the cognitive limitations of both knowledge and cognitive capacity Bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics It is concerned with the ways in which the actual decisionmaking process influences decisions Theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory This quote needs a citation Simon determined that the best way to study these areas was through computer simulations As such he developed an interest in computer science Simons main interests in computer science were in artificial intelligence humancomputer interaction principles of the organization of humans and machines as information processing systems the use of computers to study by modeling philosophical problems of the nature of intelligence and of epistemology and the social implications of computer technology citation needed In his youth Simon took an interest in land economics and Georgism an idea known at the time as single tax 17 The system is meant to redistribute unearned economic rent to the public and improve land use In 1979 Simon still maintained these ideas and argued that land value tax should replace taxes on wages 47 Some of Simons economic research was directed toward understanding technological change in general and the information processing revolution in particular citation needed Pedagogy edit Simons work has strongly influenced John Mighton developer of a program that has achieved significant success in improving mathematics performance among elementary and high school students 48 Mighton cites a 2000 paper by Simon and two coauthors that counters arguments by French mathematics educator Guy Brousseau and others suggesting that excessive practice hampers childrens understanding 48 The criticism of practice called drill and kill as if this phrase constituted empirical evaluation is prominent in constructivist writings Nothing flies more in the face of the last 20 years of research than the assertion that practice is bad All evidence from the laboratory and from extensive case studies of professionals indicates that real competence only comes with extensive practice In denying the critical role of practice one is denying children the very thing they need to achieve real competence The instructional task is not to kill motivation by demanding drill but to find tasks that provide practice while at the same time sustaining interest John R Anderson Lynne M Reder and

in 1938 Their marriage lasted 63 years until his death In January 2001 Simon underwent surgery at UPMC Presbyterian to remove a cancerous tumor in his abdomen Although the surgery was successful Simon later succumbed to the complications that followed They had three children Katherine Peter and Barbara His wife died in 2002 1 From 1950 to 1955 Simon studied mathematical economics and during this time together with David Hawkins discovered and proved the HawkinsSimon theorem on the conditions for the existence of positive solution vectors for inputoutput matrices He also developed theorems on neardecomposability and aggregation Having begun to apply these theorems to organizations by 1954 Simon determined that the best way to study problemsolving was to simulate it with computer programs which led to his interest in computer simulation of human cognition Founded during the 1950s he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research citation needed Simon had a keen interest in the arts as he was a pianist He was a friend of Robert Lepper 56 and Richard Rappaport 57 Rappaport also painted Simons commissioned portrait at Carnegie Mellon University 21 He was also a keen mountain climber As a testament to his wide interests he at one point taught an undergraduate course on the French Revolution 5 References edit Citations edit a b Dorothea Simon Obituary
