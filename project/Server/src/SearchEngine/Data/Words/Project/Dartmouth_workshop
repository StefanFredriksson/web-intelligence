on Artificial Intelligence Date 1956 1956 Duration eight weeks Venue Dartmouth College Hanover New Hampshire Organised by John McCarthy Participants Marvin Minsky Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon who proposed the workshop with others The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence was a 1956 summer workshop widely considered 1 2 3 to be the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field The project lasted approximately six to eight weeks and was essentially an extended brainstorming session Eleven mathematicians and scientists originally planned to attend not all of them attended but more than ten others came for short times Contents 1 Background 2 Dates 3 Participants 4 Event and aftermath 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Background edit In the early 1950s there were various names for the field of thinking machines cybernetics automata theory and complex information processing 4 The variety of names suggests the variety of conceptual orientations In 1955 John McCarthy then a young Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Dartmouth College decided to organize a group to clarify and develop ideas about thinking machines He picked the name Artificial Intelligence for the new field He chose the name partly for its neutrality avoiding a focus on narrow automata theory and avoiding cybernetics which was heavily focused on analog feedback as well as him potentially having to accept the assertive Norbert Wiener as guru or having to argue with him 5 In early 1955 McCarthy approached the Rockefeller Foundation to request funding for a summer seminar at Dartmouth for about 10 participants In June he and Claude Shannon a founder of information theory then at Bell Labs met with Robert Morison Director of Biological and Medical Research to discuss the idea and possible funding though Morison was unsure whether money would be made available for such a visionary project 6 On September 2 1955 the project was formally proposed by McCarthy Marvin Minsky Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon The proposal is credited with introducing the term artificial intelligence The Proposal states 7 We propose that a 2month 10man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover New Hampshire The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language form abstractions and concepts solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans and improve themselves We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer The proposal goes on to discuss computers natural language processing neural networks theory of computation abstraction and creativity these areas within the field of artificial intelligence are considered still relevant to the work of the field 8 On May 26 1956 McCarthy notified Robert Morison of the planned 11 attendees For the full period 1 Dr Marvin Minsky 2 Dr Julian Bigelow 3 Professor DM Mackay 4 Mr Ray Solomonoff 5 Mr John Holland 6 Mr John McCarthy For four weeks 7 Dr Claude Shannon 8 Mr Nathanial Rochester 9 Mr Oliver Selfridge For the first two weeks 10 Mr Allen Newell 11 Professor Herbert Simon He noted we will concentrate on a problem of devising a way of programming a calculator to form concepts and to form generalizations This of course is subject to change when the group gets together 9 According to Stottler Henke Associates besides the proposals authors attendees at the conference included Ray Solomonoff Oliver Selfridge Trenchard More Arthur Samuel Herbert A Simon and Allen Newell 10 11 12 The actual participants came at different times mostly for much shorter times Trenchard More replaced Rochester for three weeks and MacKay and Holland did not attend but the project was set to begin Around June 18 1956 the earliest participants perhaps only Ray Solomonoff maybe with Tom Etter arrived at the Dartmouth campus in Hanover NH to join John McCarthy who already had an apartment there Ray and Marvin stayed at Professors apartments but most would stay at the Hanover Inn Dates edit The Dartmouth Workshop is said to have run for six weeks in the summer of 1956 13 Ray Solomonoffs notes written during the Workshop however say it ran for roughly eight weeks from about June 18 to August 17 14 Solomonoffs Dartmouth notes start on June 22 June 28 mentions Minsky June 30 mentions Hanover NH July 1 mentions Tom Etter On August 17 Ray gave a final talk 15 Participants edit Initially McCarthy lost his list of attendees Instead after the workshop McCarthy sent Ray a preliminary list of participants and visitors plus those interested in the subject There were 47 people listed 16 Solomonoff however made a complete list in his notes of the summer project 17 Ray Solomonoff Marvin Minsky John McCarthy Claude Shannon Trenchard More Nat Rochester Oliver Selfridge Julian Bigelow W Ross Ashby WS McCulloch Abraham Robinson Tom Etter John Nash David Sayre Arthur Samuel Kenneth R Shoulders Shoulders friend Alex Bernstein Herbert Simon Allen Newell Shannon attended Rays talk on July 10 and Bigelow gave a talk on August 15 Ray doesnt mention Bernard Widrow but apparently he visited along with WA Clark and BG Farley 18 Trenchard mentions R Culver and Ray mentions Bill Shutz Herb Gelernter didnt attend but was influenced later by what Rochester learned 19 Gloria Minsky also commuted there with their partbeagle dog Senje who would start out in the car back seat and end up curled around her like a scarf and attended some sessions without Senje 20 Ray Solomonoff Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy were the only three who stayed for the fulltime Trenchard took attendance during two weeks of his threeweek visit From three to about eight people would attend the daily sessions 21 Event and aftermath edit They had the entire top floor of the Dartmouth Math Department to themselves and most weekdays they would meet at the main math classroom where someone might lead a discussion focusing on hisher ideas or more frequently a general discussion would be held It was not a directed group research project discussions covered many topics but several directions are considered to have been initiated or encouraged by the Workshop the rise of symbolic methods systems focussed on limited domains early Expert Systems and deductive systems versus inductive systems One participant Arthur Samuel said It was very interesting very stimulating very exciting 22 Ray Solomonoff kept notes giving his impression of the talks and the ideas from various discussions 23 See also edit Glossary of artificial intelligence History of artificial intelligence AI50 a 50th
