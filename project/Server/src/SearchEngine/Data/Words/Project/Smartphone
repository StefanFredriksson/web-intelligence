Smartphone Smartphones redirects here For the song see Trey Songz 20132017 Trigga and Tremaine the Album Multipurpose mobile device Two smartphones a Samsung Galaxy J5 left and an iPhone 6S right Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multipurpose mobile computing devices They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems which facilitate wider software internet including web browsing 1 over mobile broadband and multimedia functionality including music video cameras and gaming alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging Smartphones typically contain a number of metaloxidesemiconductor MOS integrated circuit IC chips include various sensors that can be leveraged by their software such as a magnetometer proximity sensors barometer gyroscope or accelerometer and support wireless communications protocols such as Bluetooth WiFi or satellite navigation Early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market attempting to bridge the functionality of standalone personal digital assistant PDA devices with support for cellular telephony but were limited by their bulky form short battery life slow analog cellular networks and the immaturity of wireless data services These issues were eventually resolved with the exponential scaling and miniaturization of MOS transistors down to submicron levels Moores law the improved lithiumion battery faster digital mobile data networks Edholms law and more mature software platforms that allowed mobile device ecosystems to develop independently of data providers In the 2000s NTT DoCoMo s imode platform BlackBerry Nokia s Symbian platform and Windows Mobile began to gain market traction with models often featuring QWERTY keyboards or resistive touchscreen input and emphasizing access to push email and wireless internet Since the unveiling of the iPhone in 2007 the majority of smartphones have featured thin slatelike form factors with large capacitive screens with support for multitouch gestures rather than physical keyboards and offer the ability for users to download or purchase additional applications from a centralized store and use cloud storage and synchronization virtual assistants as well as mobile payment services Improved hardware and faster wireless communication due to standards such as LTE have bolstered the growth of the smartphone industry In the third quarter of 2012 one billion smartphones were in use worldwide 2 Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales

miniaturization of MOSFETs MOS transistors down to submicron levels during the 1990s2000s as predicted by Moores law made it possible to build portable smart devices such as smartphones 4 5 6 as well as enabling the transistion from analog to faster digital wireless mobile networks leading to Edholms law 7 8 9 Other important enabling factors include the lithiumion battery an indispensable energy source enabling long battery life 10 invented in the 1980s 11 and commercialized in 1991 12 and the development of more mature software platforms that allowed mobile device ecosystems to develop independently of data providers Forerunner IBM Simon and charging base 1994 13 Main article IBM Simon In the early 1990s IBM engineer Frank Canova realised that chipandwireless technology was becoming small enough to use in handheld devices 14 The first commercially available device that could be properly referred to as a smartphone began as a prototype called Angler developed by Canova in 1992 while at IBM and demonstrated in November of that year at the COMDEX computer industry trade show 15 16 17 A refined version was marketed to consumers in 1994 by BellSouth under the name Simon Personal Communicator In addition to placing and receiving cellular calls the touchscreenequipped Simon could send and receive faxes and emails It included an address book calendar appointment scheduler calculator world time clock and notepad as well as other visionary mobile applications such as maps stock reports and news 18 The IBM Simon was manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric which integrated features from its own wireless personal digital assistant PDA and cellular radio technologies 19 It featured a liquidcrystal display LCD and PC Card support 20 The Simon was commercially unsuccessful particularly due to its bulky form factor and limited battery life 21 using NiCad batteries rather than the nickelmetal hydride batteries commonly used in mobile phones in the 1990s or lithiumion batteries used in modern smartphones 22 The term smart phone or smartphone was not coined until a year after the introduction of the Simon appearing in print as early as 1995 describing ATTs PhoneWriter Communicator 23 nonprimary source needed PDAphone hybrids Main article Personal digital assistant Beginning in the midlate 1990s many people who had mobile phones carried a separate dedicated PDA device running early versions of operating systems such as Palm OS Newton OS Symbian or Windows CE Pocket PC These operating systems would later evolve into early mobile operating systems Most of the smartphones in this era were hybrid devices that combined these existing familiar PDA OSes with basic phone hardware The results were devices that were bulkier than either dedicated mobile phones or PDAs but allowed a limited amount of cellular Internet access PDA and mobile phone manufacturers competed in reducing the size of devices The bulk of these smartphones combined with their high cost and expensive data plans plus other drawbacks such as expansion limitations and decreased battery life compared to separate standalone devices generally limited their popularity to early adopters and business users who needed portable connectivity In March 1996 HewlettPackard released the OmniGo 700LX a modified HP 200LX palmtop PC with a Nokia 2110 mobile phone piggybacked onto it and ROM based software to support it It had a 640200 resolution CGA compatible fourshade grayscale LCD screen and could be used to place and receive calls and to create and receive text messages emails and faxes It was also 100 DOS 50 compatible allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles including early versions of Windows The Nokia 9000 Communicator right and the updated 9110 model left In August 1996 Nokia released the Nokia 9000 Communicator a digital cellular PDA based on the Nokia 2110 with an integrated system based on the PENGEOS 30 operating system from Geoworks The two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design with the display above and a physical QWERTY keyboard below The PDA provided email calendar address book calculator and notebook applications textbased Web browsing and could send and receive faxes When closed the device could be used as a digital cellular telephone In June 1999 Qualcomm released the pdQ Smartphone a CDMA digital PCS smartphone with an integrated Palm PDA and Internet connectivity 24 Subsequent landmark devices included The Ericsson R380 December 2000 25 by Ericsson Mobile Communications 26 the first phone running the operating system later named Symbian it ran EPOC Release 5 which was renamed Symbian OS at Release 6 It had PDA functionality and limited Web browsing on a resistive touchscreen utilizing a stylus 27 While it was marketed as a smartphone 28 users could not install their own software on the device The Kyocera 6035 February 2001 29 a dualnature device with a separate Palm OS PDA operating system and CDMA mobile phone firmware It supported limited Web browsing with the PDA software treating the phone hardware as an attached modem 30 31 The Nokia 9210 Communicator June 2001 32 the first phone running Symbian Release 6 with Nokia s Series 80 platform v10 This was the first Symbian phone platform allowing the installation of additional applications Like the Nokia 9000 Communicator its a large clamshell device with a full physical QWERTY keyboard inside Handspring s Treo 180 2002 the first smartphone that fully integrated the Palm OS on a GSM mobile phone having telephony SMS messaging and Internet access built into the OS The 180 model had a thumbtype keyboard and the 180g version had a Graffiti handwriting recognition area instead 33 Japanese cell phones Main articles Japanese mobile phone culture and Mobile phone industry in Japan In 1999 Japanese wireless provider NTT DoCoMo launched imode a new mobile internet platform which provided data transmission speeds up to 96 kilobits per second and access web services available through the platform such as online shopping NTT DoCoMos imode used cHTML a language which restricted some aspects of traditional HTML in favor of increasing data speed for the devices Limited functionality small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available The rise of imode helped NTT DoCoMo accumulate an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001 and ranked first in market capitalization in Japan and second globally 34 Japanese cell phones increasingly diverged from global standards and trends to offer other forms of advanced services and smartphonelike functionality that were specifically tailored to the Japanese market such as mobile payments and shopping nearfield communication NFC allowing mobile wallet functionality to replace smart cards for transit fares loyalty cards identity cards event tickets coupons money transfer etc downloadable content like musical ringtones games and comics and 1seg mobile television 35 36 Phones built by Japanese manufacturers used custom firmware however and didnt yet feature standardized mobile operating systems designed to cater to thirdparty application development so their software and ecosystems were akin to very advanced feature phones As with other feature phones additional software and services required partnerships and deals with providers The degree of integration between phones and carriers unique phone features nonstandardized platforms and tailoring to Japanese culture made it difficult for Japanese manufacturers to export their phones especially when demand was so high in Japan that the companies didnt feel the need to look elsewhere for additional profits 37 38 39 The rise of 3G technology in other markets and nonJapanese phones with powerful standardized smartphone operating systems app stores and advanced wireless network capabilities allowed nonJapanese phone manufacturers to finally break in to the Japanese market gradually adopting Japanese phone features like emojis mobile payments NFC etc and spreading them to the rest of the world Early smartphones Several BlackBerry smartphones which were highly popular in the midlate 2000s Phones that made effective use of any significant data connectivity were still rare outside Japan until the introduction of the Danger Hiptop in 2002 which saw moderate success among US consumers as the TMobile Sidekick Later in the mid2000s business users in the US started to adopt devices based on Microsofts Windows Mobile and then BlackBerry smartphones from Research In Motion American users popularized the term CrackBerry in 2006 due to the BlackBerrys addictive nature 40 In the US the high cost of data plans and relative rarity of devices with WiFi capabilities that could avoid cellular data network usage kept adoption of smartphones mainly to business professionals and early adopters Outside the US and Japan Nokia was seeing success with its smartphones based on Symbian originally developed by Psion for their personal organisers and it was the most popular smartphone OS in Europe during the middle to late 2000s Initially Nokias Symbian smartphones were focused on business with the Eseries 41 similar to Windows Mobile and BlackBerry devices at the time From 2006 onwards Nokia started producing consumerfocused smartphones popularized by the entertainmentfocused Nseries Until 2010 Symbian was the worlds most widely used smartphone operating system 42 Form factor and operating system shifts The original Apple iPhone following its introduction the common smartphone form factor shifted to large touchscreen software interfaces without physical keypads 43 The touchscreen PDA derived nature of adapted operating systems like Palm OS the Pocket PC versions of what was later Windows Mobile and the UIQ interface that was originally designed for penbased PDAs on Symbian OS devices resulted in some early smartphones having stylusbased interfaces These allowed for virtual keyboards andor handwriting input thus also allowing easy entry of Asian characters 44 By the mid2000s the majority of smartphones had a physical QWERTY keyboard Most used a keyboard bar form factor like the BlackBerry line Windows Mobile smartphones Palm Treos and some of the Nokia Eseries A few hid their full physical QWERTY keyboard in a sliding form factor like the Danger Hiptop line Some even had only a numeric keypad using T9 text input like the Nokia Nseries and other models in the Nokia Eseries Resistive touchscreens with stylus based interfaces could still be found on a few smartphones like the Palm Treos which had dropped their handwriting input after a few early models that were available in versions with Graffiti instead of a keyboard The late 2000s and early 2010s saw a shift in smartphone interfaces away from devices with physical keyboards and keypads to ones with large fingeroperated capacitive touchscreens 43 The first phone of any kind with a large capacitive touchscreen was the LG Prada announced by LG in December 2006 45 This was a fashionable feature phone created in collaboration with Italian luxury designer Prada with a 3 240x400 pixel screen 46 In January 2007 Apple Computer introduced the iPhone 47 48 49 It had a 35 capacitive touchscreen with twice the common resolution of most smartphone screens at the time 50 and introduced multitouch to phones which allowed gestures such as pinching to zoom in or out on photos maps and web pages The iPhone was notable as being the first device of its kind targeted at the mass market to abandon the use of a stylus keyboard or keypad typical of contemporary smartphones instead using a large touchscreen for direct finger input as its main means of interaction 44 The iPhones operating system was also a shift away from previous ones that were adapted from PDAs and feature phones to one powerful enough to avoid using a limited stripped down web browser requiring pages specially formatted using technologies such as WML cHTML or XHTML that previous phones supported and instead run a version of Apples Safari browser that could easily render full websites 51 52 53 not specifically designed for phones 54 Later Apple shipped a software update that gave the iPhone a builtin ondevice App Store allowing direct wireless downloads of thirdparty software 55 56 This kind of centralized App Store and free developer tools 57 58 quickly became the new main paradigm for all smartphone platforms for software development distribution discovery installation and payment in place of expensive developer tools that required official approval to use and a dependence on thirdparty sources providing applications for multiple platforms 43 The advantages of a design with software powerful enough to support advanced applications and a large capacitive touchscreen affected the development of another smartphone OS platform Android with a more BlackBerrylike prototype device scrapped in favor of a touchscreen device with a slideout physical keyboard as Googles engineers thought at the time that a touchscreen could not completely replace a physical keyboard and buttons 59 60 61 Android is based around a modified Linux kernel again providing more power than mobile operating systems adapted from PDAs and feature phones The first Android device the HTC Dream was released in September 2008 62 with both a 32 capacitive touchscreen and a hardware keyboard that was revealed when the user slid the screen open By 2010 the majority of Android phones were touchscreenonly The iPhone and later touchscreenonly Android devices together popularized the smartphone form factor based on a large capacitive touchscreen as the sole means of interaction and led to the decline of earlier keyboard and keypadfocused platforms 43 Other smartphone manufacturers soon started projects to replace their existing operating systems with new ones that could support touch interfaces on larger screens and web browsers that could render full web pages Microsoft for instance discontinued Windows Mobile and started a new touchscreenoriented OS from scratch called Windows Phone Nokia abandoned Symbian and partnered with Microsoft to use Windows Phone on its smartphones Palm replaced their Palm OS with webOS BlackBerry Limited formerly known as Research In Motion and known for phones with a full qwerty keyboard below the screen made a new platform for touchscreen phones based on QNX BlackBerry 10 By the mid2010s almost all smartphones were touchscreenonly and had discarded legacy mobile operating systems for more recently developed ones that were more capable Camera advancements The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 features three rearfacing camera lenses and a ToF camera only 10 version Further information Digital camera and Camera phone The first commercial camera phone was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP210 released in Japan in May 1999 63 It was called a mobile videophone at the time 64 and had a 110000 pixel frontfacing camera 63 It could send up to two images per second over Japans Personal Handyphone System PHS cellular network and store up to 20 JPEG digital images which could be sent over email 63 The first massmarket camera phone was the JSH04 a Sharp JPhone model sold in Japan in November 2000 65 66 It could instantly transmit pictures via cell phone telecommunication 67 By the mid2000s higherend cell phones commonly had integrated digital cameras In 2003 camera phones outsold standalone digital cameras and in 2006 they outsold film and digital standalone cameras Five billion camera phones were sold in five years and by 2007 more than half of the installed base of all mobile phones were camera phones Sales of separate cameras peaked in 2008 68 Many early smartphones didnt have cameras at all and earlier models that had them had low performance and insufficient image and video quality that could not compete with budget pocket cameras and fullfill users needs 69 By the beginning of the 2010s almost all smartphones had an integrated digital camera The decline in sales of standalone cameras accelerated due to the increasing use of smartphones with rapidly improving camera technology for casual photography easier image manipulation and abilities to directly share photos through the use of apps and webbased services 70 71 72 73 By 2011 cell phones with integrated cameras were selling hundreds of millions per year In 2015 digital camera sales were 35395 million units or only less than a third of digital camera sales numbers at their peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number at their peak 74 75 Contributing to the rise in popularity of smartphones being used over dedicated cameras for photography smaller pocket cameras have difficulty producing bokeh in images but nowadays some smartphones have duallens cameras that reproduce the bokeh effect easily and can even rearrange the level of bokeh after shooting This works by capturing multiple images with different focus settings then combining the background of the main image with a macro focus shot In 2007 the Nokia N95 was notable as a smartphone that had a 50 Megapixel MP camera when most others had cameras with around 3 MP or less than 2 MP Some specialized feature phones like the LG Viewty Samsung SGHG800 and Sony Ericsson K850i all released later that year also had 50 MP cameras By 2010 50 MP cameras were common a few smartphones had 80 MP cameras and the Nokia N8 Sony Ericsson Satio 76 and Samsung M8910 Pixon12 77 feature phone had 12 MP In 2009 the Samsung Omnia HD was the first phone with 720p video recording A 14megapixel smartphone with 3x optical zoom was announced in late 2010 78 In 2012 Nokia announced the Nokia 808 PureView featuring a 41megapixel 112inch sensor and a highresolution f24 Zeiss allaspherical onegroup lens 1080p video recording on a smartphone was achieved in 2011 and 2160p 4K video recording in 2013 In 2016 Apple introduced the iPhone 7 Plus one of the phones to popularize a dual camera setup The iPhone 7 Plus included a main 12 MP camera along with a 12 MP telephoto camera which allowed for 2x optical zoom and Portrait Mode simulated Bokeh 79 In early 2018 Huawei released a new flagship phone the Huawei P20 Pro with one of the first triple camera lens setups 80 In late 2018 Samsung released a new midrange smartphone the Galaxy A9 2018 with the worlds first quad camera setup The Nokia 9 PureView was released in 2019 featuring a pentalens camera system 81 In 2019 Oppo demonstrated an underdisplay selfie camera made possible by the use of an OLED display that had a cutout underneath it allowing the display to be transparent where the camera is located This technique is already used for placing proximity and optical fingerprint sensors under the display The smartphone on which it was demonstrated had no physical buttons using capacitive buttons instead no SIM slot using eSIM as a replacement no microSD card slot no headphone jack no USBC and no speaker or earpiece grilles relying exclusively on internal storage wireless charging 5G WiFi and Bluetooth 82 83 84 85 86 Display advancements The iPhone X In the early 2010s larger smartphones with screen sizes of at least 55 inches diagonal dubbed phablets began to achieve popularity with the 2011 Samsung Galaxy Note series gaining notably wide adoption 87 88 In 2013 Huawei launched the Huawei Mate series sporting a 61inch HD 1280x720 IPS LCD display which was considered to be quite large at the time 89 Some companies began to release smartphones in 2013 incorporating flexible displays to create curved form factors such as the Samsung Galaxy Round and LG G Flex 90 91 92 By 2014 1440p displays began to appear on highend smartphones 93 In 2015 Sony released the Xperia Z5 Premium featuring a 4K resolution display although only images and videos could actually be rendered at that resolution all other software was shown at 1080p 94 New trends for smartphone displays began to emerge in 2017 with both LG and Samsung releasing flagship smartphones LG G6 and Galaxy S8 utilizing displays with taller aspect ratios than the common 169 ratio and a high screentobody ratio also known as bezelless design These designs allow the display to have a larger diagonal measurement but with a slimmer width than 169 displays with an equivalent screen size 95 96 97 Another trend popularized in 2017 was having a display that contained a tablike cutout at the topcentrecolloquially known as a notchto contain the frontfacing camera and sometimes other sensors typically located along the top bezel of a device This was introduced for the first time in 2016 by the LG V10 98 99 These designs allow for edgetoedge displays that take up nearly the entire height of the device with little to no bezel along the top and sometimes a minimal bottom bezel as well This design characteristic appeared almost simultaneously on the Sharp Aquos S2 and the Essential Phone 100 which featured circular tabs for their cameras followed just a month later by the iPhone X which used a wider tab to contain a camera and facial scanning system 101 An example of a flexible display Smartphones with foldable displays were theorized as possible once manufacturing costs and production processes were feasible 102 In November 2018 the startup company Royole unveiled the first commercially available foldable smartphone the Royole FlexPai Also that month Samsung presented a prototype phone featuring an Infinity Flex Display at its developers conference with a smaller outer display on its cover and a larger tabletsized display when opened Samsung stated that it also had to develop a new polymer material to coat the display as opposed to glass 103 104 105 Early examples of foldable phones from other manufacturers became the subject of rumors in early 2019 106 107 Samsung officially announced the Galaxy Fold based on the previouslydemonstrated prototype in February 2019 for an originallyscheduled release in lateApril 108 In 2019 47inches to 55 inches have become the industry standard size with most companies abandoning smaller under 47inch displays 109 Other developments in the 2010s 2011 The first smartphone with a fingerprint reader was the Motorola Atrix 4G in 2011 110 In September 2013 the iPhone 5S was unveiled as the first smartphone on a major US carrier since the Atrix to feature this technology 111 Once again the iPhone popularized this concept 2012 In 2012 Samsung introduced the Galaxy S3 GTi9300 with retrofittable wireless charging popup video playback 4G LTE variant GTi9305 quadcore processor 2013 In 2013 Fairphone launched its first socially ethical smartphone at the London Design Festival to address concerns regarding the sourcing of materials in the manufacturing 112 followed by Shiftphone in 2015 113 In late 2013 QSAlpha commenced production of a smartphone designed entirely around security encryption and identity protection 114 In October 2013 Motorola Mobility announced Project Ara a concept for a modular smartphone platform that would allow users to customize and upgrade their phones with addon modules that attached magnetically to a frame 115 116 Ara was retained by Google following its sale of Motorola Mobility to Lenovo 117 but was shelved in 2016 118 That year LG and Motorola both unveiled smartphones featuring a limited form of modularity for accessories the LG G5 allowed accessories to be installed via the removal of its battery compartment 119 while the Moto Z utilizes accessories attached magnetically to the rear of the device 120 2014 Microsoft expanding upon the concept of Motorolas shortlived Webtop unveiled functionality for its Windows 10 operating system for phones that allows supported devices to be docked for use with a PCstyled desktop environment 121 122 2015 Samsung and LG used to be the last standing manufacturers to offer flagship devices with userreplaceable batteriesBut in 2015 Samsung succumbed to the minimalism trend set by Apple introducing the Galaxy S6 with a nonuserreplaceable battery In addition Samsung was criticised for pruning longstanding features such as MHL Micro USB 30 water resistance and MicroSD card support of which the latter two came back in 2016 with the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge As of 2015 the global median for smartphone ownership was 43 123 Statista forecast that 287 billion people would own smartphones in 2020 124 2016 Major technologies that began to trend in 2016 included a focus on virtual reality and augmented reality experiences catered towards smartphones the newly introduced USBC connector and improving LTE technologies 125 2018 In 2018 the first smartphones featuring fingerprint readers embedded within OLED displays were announced followed in 2019 by an implementation using an ultrasonic sensor on the Samsung Galaxy S10 126 127 2019 In 2019 major smartphone have more than one camera fully waterproof enhanced privacy protection have some sort of unlocking using facial recognition or fingerpriting 128 Hardware Main article Mobile phone features A typical smartphone contains a number of metaloxidesemiconductor MOS integrated circuit IC chips 129 which in turn contain billions of tiny MOS fieldeffect transistors MOSFETs 5 A typical smartphone contains the following MOS IC chips 129 Application processor CMOS systemonachip Flash memory floatinggate MOS memory Cellular modem baseband RF CMOS RF transceiver RF CMOS Phone camera image sensor CMOS image sensor Power management integrated circuit power MOSFETs Display driver LCD or LED driver Wireless communication chips WiFi Bluetooth GPS receiver Sound chip audio codec and power amplifier Gyroscope Capacitive touchscreen controller ASIC and DSP 129 130 131 RF power amplifier LDMOS 7 8 132 A hardware notification LED on some phones Central processing unit Smartphones have central processing units CPUs similar to those in computers but optimised to operate in low power environments In smartphones the CPU is typically integrated in a CMOS complementary metaloxidesemiconductor systemonachip SoC application processor 129 The performance of mobile CPU depends not only on the clock rate generally given in multiples of hertz 133 but also on the memory hierarchy Because of these challenges the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications Display Main article Display device A smartphone touchscreen One of the main characteristics of smartphones is the screen Depending on the devices design the screen fills most or nearly all of the space on a devices front surface Many smartphone displays have an aspect ratio of 169 but taller aspect ratios became more common in 2017 Screen sizes are measured in diagonal inches Phones with screens larger than 52 inches are often called phablets Smartphones with screens over 45 inches in size are commonly difficult to use with only a single hand since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface they may need to be shifted around in the hand held in one hand and manipulated by the other or used in place with both hands Due to design advances some modern smartphones with large screen sizes and edgetoedge designs have compact builds that improve their ergonomics while the shift to taller aspect ratios have resulted in phones that have larger screen sizes whilst maintaining the ergonomics associated with smaller 169 displays 134 135 136 Liquidcrystal displays LCDs and organic lightemitting diode OLED displays are the most common Some displays are integrated with pressuresensitive digitizers such as those developed by Wacom and Samsung 137 and Apples Force Touch system Sound Some audio quality enhancing features such as Voice over LTE and HD Voice have appeared and are often available on newer smartphones Sound quality can remain a problem due to the design of the phone the quality of the cellular network and compression algorithms used in long distance calls 138 139 Audio quality can be improved using a VoIP application over WiFi 140 Cellphones have small speakers so that the user can use a speakerphone feature and talk to a person on the phone without holding it to their ear The small speakers can also be used to listen to digital audio files of music or speech or watch videos with an audio component without holding the phone close to the ear Battery A highcapacity portable battery charger A smartphone typically uses a lithiumion battery 10 11 12 By the end of 2017 smartphone battery life has become generally adequate 141 however earlier smartphone battery life was poor due to the weak batteries that could not handle the significant power requirements of the smartphones computer systems and color screens 142 143 144 Smartphone users purchase additional chargers for use outside the home at work and in cars and by buying portable external battery packs External battery packs include generic models which are connected to the smartphone with a cable and custommade models that piggyback onto a smartphones case In 2016 Samsung had to recall millions of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to an explosive battery issue 145 For consumer convenience wireless charging stations have been introduced in some hotels bars and other public spaces 146 Cameras Main articles Camera phone Digital camera and Videophone Cameras have become standard features of smartphones As of 2019 phone cameras are now a highly competitive area of differentiation between models with advertising campaigns commonly based on a focus on the quality or capabilities of a devices main cameras Typically smartphones have at least one main rearfacing camera and a lowerresolution frontfacing camera for selfies and video chat Owing to the limited depth available in smartphones for image sensors and optics rearfacing cameras are often housed in a bump thats thicker than the rest of the phone Since increasingly thin mobile phones have more abundant horizontal space than the depth that is necessary and used in dedicated cameras for better lenses theres additionally a trend for phone manufacturers to include multiple cameras with each optimized for a different purpose telephoto wide angle etc Images are usually saved in the JPEG file format some highend phones also have RAW image capability Modern advanced smartphones have cameras with optical image stabilisation OIS larger sensors bright lenses and even optical zoom plus RAW images HDR Bokeh mode with multi lenses and multishot night modes are now also familiar 147 Many new smartphone camera features are being enabled via computational photography image processing and multiple specialized lenses rather than larger sensors and lenses due to the constrained space available inside phones that are being made as slim as possible Accessories A wide range of accessories are sold for smartphones including cases screen protectors power charging cables wireless power stations USB OnTheGo adapters for connecting USB drives and or in some cases a HDMI cable to an external monitor addon batteries headphones combined headphonemicrophones which for example allow a person to privately conduct calls on the device without holding it to the ear and Bluetooth enabled powered speakers that enable users to listen to media from their smartphones wirelessly Cases range from relatively inexpensive rubber or soft plastic cases which provide moderate protection from bumps and good protection from scratches to more expensive heavyduty cases that combine a rubber padding with a hard outer shell Some cases have a booklike form with a cover that the user opens to use the device when the cover is closed it protects the screen Some booklike cases have additional pockets for credit cards thus enabling people to use them as wallets Accessories include products sold by the manufacturer of the smartphone and compatible products made by other manufacturers Software Mobile operating systems Main article Mobile operating system A mobile operating system or mobile OS is an operating system for phones tablets smartwatches or other mobile devices Mobile operating systems combine features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use usually including and most of the following considered essential in modern mobile systems a touchscreen cellular Bluetooth WiFi Protected Access WiFi Global Positioning System GPS mobile navigation video and singleframe picture cameras speech recognition voice recorder music player near field communication and infrared blaster By Q1 2018 over 383 million smartphones were sold with 859 percent running Android 141 percent running iOS and a negligible number of smartphones running other OSes 148 Android alone is more popular than the popular desktop operating system Windows and in general smartphone use even without tablets exceeds desktop use Mobile devices with mobile communications abilities eg smartphones contain two mobile operating systems the main userfacing software platform is supplemented by a second lowlevel proprietary realtime operating system which operates the radio and other hardware Research has shown that these lowlevel systems may contain a range of security vulnerabilities permitting malicious base stations to gain high levels of control over the mobile device 149 Mobile app Main article Mobile app A mobile app is a computer program designed to run on a mobile device such as a smartphone The term app is a shortform of the term software application 150 Application stores Main article List of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices The introduction of Apples App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch in July 2008 popularized manufacturerhosted online distribution for thirdparty applications software and computer programs focused on a single platform There are a huge variety of apps including video games music products and business tools Up until that point smartphone application distribution depended on thirdparty sources providing applications for multiple platforms such as GetJar Handango Handmark and PocketGear Following the success of the App Store other smartphone manufacturers launched application stores such as Googles Android Market later renamed to the Google Play Store and RIMs BlackBerry App World and Androidrelated app stores like FDroid In

generated became available through several apps for Android and the flux software for jailbroken iPhones 226 iOS 93 integrated a similar systemlevel feature known as Night Shift Several Android device manufacturers bypassed Googles initial reluctance to make Night Mode a standard feature in Android and included software for it on their hardware under varying names before Android Oreo added it to
