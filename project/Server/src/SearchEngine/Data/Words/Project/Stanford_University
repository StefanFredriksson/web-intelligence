gave its name to the entire concept commercialized as the SPARC Another success from this era were IBM s efforts that eventually led to the IBM POWER instruction set architecture PowerPC and Power ISA

world or the United States 58 59 but that depends on definitions Berry College with over 26000 acres 406sqmi 1052km 2 Paul Smiths College with 14200 acres 222sqmi 575km 2 and the United States Air Force Academy with 18500 acres 7500ha are larger but are not usually classified as universities Duke University at 8610 acres 135sqmi 348km 2 does have more land but it is not contiguous However the University of the South has over 13000 acres 203sqmi 526km 2 The rules governing the board have changed over time The original 24 trustees were appointed for life in 1885 by the Stanfords as were some of the subsequent replacements In 1899 Jane Stanford changed the maximum number of trustees from 24 to 15 and set the term of office to 10 years On June 1 1903 she resigned her powers as founder and the board took on its full powers In the 1950s the board decided that 15 members was not sufficient to do all the work needed and in March 1954 petitioned the courts to raise the maximum number to 23 of whom 20 would be regular trustees serving 10year terms and 3 would be alumni trustees serving 5year terms In 1970 another petition was successfully made to have the number raised to a maximum of 35 with a minimum of 25 that all trustees would be just trustees and that the university president would be a trustee ex officio 77 The last original trustee Timothy Hopkins died in 1936 the last life trustee Joseph D Grant appointed in 1891 died in 1942 78 References edit a b c Casper Gerhard October 5 1995 Die Luft der Freiheit wehtOn and Off Speech Retrieved April 26 2017 mwparseroutput
