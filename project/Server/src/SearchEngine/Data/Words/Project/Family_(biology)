Family biology Not to be confused with Gene family or Protein family taxonomic rank The hierarchy of biological classification s eight major taxonomic ranks An order contains one or more families Intermediate minor rankings are not shown Family Latin familia plural familiae is one of the eight major hierarchical taxonomic ranks in Linnaean taxonomy it is classified between order and genus A family may be divided into subfamilies which are intermediate ranks between the ranks of family and genus The official family names are Latin in origin however popular names are often used for example walnut trees and hickory trees belong to the family Juglandaceae but that family is commonly referred to as being the walnut family What does or does not belong to a familyor whether a described family should be recognized at allare proposed and determined by practicing taxonomists There are no hard rules for describing or recognizing a family Taxonomists often take different positions about descriptions and there may be no broad consensus across the scientific community for some time The publishing of new data and opinions often enables adjustments and consensus Contents 1 Nomenclature 2 History 3 Uses 4 See also 5 References 6 Bibliography Nomenclature edit The naming of families is codified by various international bodies using the following suffixes In fungal algal and botanical nomenclature the family names of plants fungi and algae end with the suffix aceae with the exception of a small number of historic but widely used names including Compositae and Gramineae 1 2 In zoological nomenclature the family names of animals end with the suffix idae 3 History edit The taxonomic term familia was first used by French botanist Pierre Magnol in his Prodromus historiae generalis plantarum in quo familiae plantarum per tabulas disponuntur 1689 where he called the seventysix groups of plants he recognised in his tables families familiae The concept of rank at that time was not yet settled and in the preface to the Prodromus Magnol spoke of uniting his families into larger genera which is far from how the term is used today Carolus Linnaeus used the word familia in his Philosophia botanica 1751 to denote major groups of plants trees herbs ferns palms and so on He used this term only in the morphological section of the book discussing the vegetative and generative organs of plants Subsequently in French botanical publications from Michel Adanson s Familles naturelles des plantes 1763 and until the end of the 19th century the word famille was used as a French equivalent of the Latin ordo or ordo naturalis In zoology the family as a rank intermediate between order and genus was introduced by Pierre André Latreille in his Précis des caractères génériques des insectes disposés dans un ordre naturel 1796 He used families some of them were not named in some but not in all his orders of insects which then included all arthropods In nineteenthcentury works such as the Prodromus of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and the Genera Plantarum of George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker this word ordo was used for what now is given the rank of family Uses edit Families can be used for evolutionary palaeontological and genetic studies because they are more stable than lower taxonomic levels such as genera and species 4 5 See also edit
