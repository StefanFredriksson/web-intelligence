the game of Go a handicap is given by means of stones and compensation points In contrast to an even game in which Black plays first White plays the first move in a game with handicap after Blacks handicap stones have been placed Handicap stones edit The rank difference within a given amateur ranking system is one guide to how many handicap stones should be given to make the game a more equal contest As a general rule each rank represents the value of one stone In terms of points one stone is considered to be 1316 points but this figure is not constant over levels the more skillful a player the greater the usefulness of each stone For example a 3 kyu player gives a 7 kyu player four handicap stones to allow for an interesting game with roughly equal challenge for both players If traditional fixed placement of the handicap stones is used nine stones is normally the maximum handicap Larger handicaps are certainly possible but with such a great difference in strength Black may be simply bewildered and not understand how many of Whites moves relate to his own The above rank relationship reliably applies for singledigit kyu 19k and amateur dan 17d ranks The advantage of moving first is equivalent to only half a stone of handicap as the opponent then has the initiative Because White gets the next move after Black places the handicap stones a nominal handicap of n stones is therefore in reality half a stone less than n Nowadays professional ranks are awarded by professional Go players organizations they are unlike amateur ranks not reliable as a measure of current playing strength but rather an indication of achievements Before the late 20th century they were used as strength measurement with a difference in skill of less than a third of a stone per rank Small board handicaps edit Small boards are often used for novice players doubledigit kyu players just learning to play Go or for quick games As the fewer moves made when playing on smaller boards gives White fewer chances to overcome the advantage conferred by the handicap smaller handicaps are used on smaller go boards most commonly 1313 and 99 1 The perrank handicap is therefore reduced by a scaling factor Various estimates have been given for the factor that applies to 1313 in the range 25 up to 4 and on grounds both theoretical and experimental smallboard tournament play The evidence is that 25 is more realistic than 4 for clock games The corresponding factor for a 99 board is not easy to understand and the change for each stone added is very large One theoretical approach is according to the distribution of the number of moves made in a game on a board of a given size relative to the number made on a 1919 board Using estimates that a 1919 game will last about 250300 moves a 1313 game about 95120 moves and a 99 game about 4050 moves a quadratic formula for the ratio of the mean number of plays may apply Arguing that White catches up by means of Blacks small errors so that Whites deficit drifts at a constant rate it makes sense to take the ratio of game lengths as scaling factor 2 Each full stone of handicap on a 1313 board is in any case probably equivalent to about 25 to 3 ranks and each full stone on a 99 board is equivalent to about 6 ranks For example if the appropriate handicap is 9 ie 85 stones on a 1919 board the handicap between those two players is reduced to 4 because 35 25 875 stones on a 13x13 board and 2 15 6 9 stones on a 99 board A 5 ie 45 stone handicap on a 99 board is accordingly equivalent to a handicap of 27 or 28 stones on a 1919 board These figures are not a consensus but have wide support They can be used to give rankings by converting 1313 handicaps back to rank difference Handicap placement edit Fixed placement edit The traditional placement of handicap stones There are 9 star points marked on a 19 x 19 board in each corner on the 44 point in the middle of each side on the fourth line 410 and the very center of the board 1010 Traditionally handicaps are always placed on the star points as follows Stones Placement Locations 1 Black plays his first stone as he wishes and gives no komi None 2 Black plays the star points to his upper right and lower left AB 3 Black adds the star point to his lower right In Classical Chinese rules the third handicap stone is place on tengen ABC or E 4 Black takes all four corner star points ABCD 5 Black adds the center star point ABCDE 6 Black takes all three star points at left and right ABCDFG 7 Black adds the center star point ABCDEFG 8 Black takes all star points except the center ABCDFGHI 9 Black takes all nine star points ABCDEFGHI As the stones are always at the same 44 points in the corners Black always plays more 44 openings and doesnt gain experience playing the 34 openings or others such as 33 54 53 etc except on two and three stones 3 Free placement edit Recently some have advocated free placement of handicap stones Free placement means one can place handicap stones anywhere on the board without restriction Here is the list of countries 4 and servers 5 that use free placement of handicap stones 6 Fixed Placement Japan Korea United States by default IGS online server Free Placement Chinese Ing New Zealand Although free placement is less common because many players are attached to tradition especially in East Asian countries it offers advantages which are not available with fixed placement Advantages edit For weaker players They can choose their opening strategies according to their own understanding of the game and thus follow a consistent strategy They can think for themselves and learn about different opening strategies through actual game experience The mandatory handicap points stress influence rather than taking territory directly some weaker players have a more territorial style They can learn a much larger range of corner plays in actual competition against stronger opponents For stronger players Many more variations with fewer repetitions mean the game is more refreshing challenging and interesting to the strong player They may be more willing to play and teach the weaker player Disadvantages edit With free placement weaker players may not place their stones in respect to their comparable handicap to their opponent thus eliminating the point of the handicap The standard fixed handicap points allow for a good standard that allows novices to have the handicap they need since they are not experienced and may not be able to take advantage of the free placement of handicap stones Therefore free placement handicap may be best suited for more experienced players or those who want more flexibility and variety in play Compensation points edit Main article Komidashi When the difference in strength is one rank no handicap stone is given Instead the stronger player takes White but without compensation points The compensation points are called Komi in Japanese It is a custom that Black plays first White moves second Playing first is regarded as a significant advantage in modern go and to make the game fair to both players this advantage must be compensated It is regarded that playing first is equal to half a move or more ahead throughout the game Another common type of compensation used is the reverse compensation points where the weaker player takes black and is given both the first move and compensation points too This is more advantageous than the above situation Compensation points are sometimes preferred to stones because the players would like to play or practice as if it is an even game They would like to have the feel of an even game White the stronger player must play better to overcome these disadvantages points gained by playing first compensation points Fixed compensation point Komi system edit When ranks are equal Black gets advantages by playing first The advantage of that first move is compensated by compensation points However there are still no absolute standards on the number of compensation points due to the difficulty of determining a fair value 65 points are used in Japan and Korea 75 points are used in China and America see AGA rules The 05 point is used to prevent a draw Auction compensation point system edit As no one can be absolutely sure what the fair number of compensation points is some advocate another system which is often used in some amateur matches and tournaments There are no fixed compensation points The decision is left to both players They arrive at a value through negotiation and bidding This is called auction compensation point system Examples of auction komi systems include one player chooses how big komi will be given to White and the other player then chooses to play Black or White the game is without komi one player makes the first move of Black not too weak and not too strong and the other one then chooses to play Black or White This is an application of the pie rule the players do an auction by saying I am willing to play Black against XXX komi and the player who wins the auction plays Black Handicap strategy edit Handicap go is the traditional form of teaching given to go players Fixed handicap placements are in effect a form of graded tutorials if you cannot beat your teacher with a ninestone handicap some fundamental points are still to be learned The pedagogic value of fixed handicaps is an old debate for Western players The theory of handicap go shares with much of the rest of the Japanese pedagogic go literature a less explicit approach based on perception as much as analysis Whether fixed handicap placement makes it easier or more difficult for the weaker player to learn these fundamental points is moot The nature of these tutorial steps may certainly be misunderstood and contested by Western players new to the game Handicaps are also unpopular with Chinese players who have more of a tradition of equality at the board rather than deference to a teacher There are some book treatments of lowhandicap go by strong professionals Kobayashi Koichi and Kajiwara Takeo in particular and examples of propro games to follow With the traditional handicap placements the only consistent strategy Black can follow depends on the use of influence This is particularly true in the early stages of the middlegame fighting 7 While Black often assumes that consolidating territory from the opening stages should be enough to win that is not the case when the handicap stones are placed on the star points where they are more effective in obtaining influence than territory If Black does not understand and utilize the value of starpoint handicap stones for attack White will gradually build a more advantageous position and steadily close the gap Notes and references edit See page at Senseis Library for a fuller discussion Psychologically speaking Black the pupil probably sees blunders as more important in a loss but White the teacher is more aware of getting into the game by means of Blacks inefficiencies Historically in China Black and White were constrained to play on diagonallyopposite star points for their first two moves in even games In Japan from some point in the sixteenth century perhaps the board was empty in even games The consequence was a deeper study of the joseki that in the Chinese system were used only in threestone handicaps Those joseki dominated opening theory in Japan until the shinfuseki period of the 1930s In contemporary go the 44 point openings are fundamental Handicap placement convention and effect actually depends on different rule sets such as Japanese or Chinese rules and not on different countries Not all countries have their own rule sets Some servers offer a choice between different rule sets Comparison of some Go rules See for example the book Kages Secret Chronicles In it more explicit reference is made than is typical to the need to fight hard rather than play slackly in order to use the handicap stones properly This lesson on influence is at the heart of the traditional system
