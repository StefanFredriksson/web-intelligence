intelligence of a machine that can understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and futures studies AGI can also be referred to as strong AI 1 2 3 full AI 4 or general intelligent action 5 Some academic sources reserve the term strong AI for machines that can experience consciousness 6 Some authorities emphasize a distinction between strong AI and applied AI 7 also called narrow AI 2 or weak AI 8 the use of software to study or accomplish specific problem solving or reasoning tasks Weak AI in contrast to strong AI does not attempt to perform the full range of human cognitive abilities As of 2017 over forty organizations were doing research on AGI 9 Contents 1

Cognitive science Various criteria for intelligence have been proposed most famously the Turing test but to date there is no definition that satisfies everyone 10 However there is wide agreement among artificial intelligence researchers that intelligence is required to do the following 11 reason use strategy solve puzzles and make judgments under uncertainty represent knowledge including commonsense knowledge plan learn communicate in natural language and integrate all these skills towards common goals Other important capabilities include the ability to sense eg see and the ability to act eg move and manipulate objects in the world where intelligent behaviour is to be observed 12 This would include an ability to detect and respond to hazard 13 Many interdisciplinary approaches to intelligence eg cognitive science computational intelligence and decision making tend to emphasise the need to consider additional traits such as imagination taken as the ability to form mental images and concepts that were not programmed in 14 and autonomy 15 Computer based systems that exhibit many of these capabilities do exist eg see computational creativity automated reasoning decision support system robot evolutionary computation intelligent agent but not yet at human levels Tests for confirming humanlevel AGI 16 17 edit The Turing Test Turing A machine and a human both converse sight unseen with a second human who must evaluate which of the two is the machine which passes the test if it can fool the evaluator a significant fraction of the time Note Turing does not prescribe what should qualify as intelligence only that knowing that it is a machine should disqualify it The Coffee Test Wozniak A machine is required to enter an average American home and figure out how to make coffee find the coffee machine find the coffee add water find a mug and brew the coffee by pushing the proper buttons The Robot College Student Test Goertzel A machine enrolls in a university taking and passing the same classes that humans would and obtaining a degree The Employment Test Nilsson A machine works an economically important job performing at least as well as humans in the same job IQtests AGI edit Chinese researchers Feng Liu Yong Shi and Ying Liu conducted intelligence tests in the summer of 2017 with publicly available and freely accessible weak AI such as Google AI or Apples Siri and others At the maximum these AI reached a value of about 47 which corresponds approximately to a sixyearold child in first grade An adult comes to about 100 on average In 2014 similar tests were carried out in which the AI reached a maximum value of 27 18 19 Problems requiring AGI to solve edit Main article AIcomplete The most difficult problems for computers are informally known as AIcomplete or AIhard implying that solving them is equivalent to the general aptitude of human intelligence or strong AI beyond the capabilities of a purposespecific algorithm 20 AIcomplete problems are hypothesised to include general computer vision natural language understanding and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem 21 AIcomplete problems cannot be solved with current computer technology alone and also require human computation This property could be useful for example to test for the presence of humans as CAPTCHAs aim to do and for computer security to repel bruteforce attacks 22 23 AGI research edit Classical AI edit Main article History of artificial intelligence Modern AI research began in the mid 1950s 24 The first generation of AI researchers was convinced that artificial general intelligence was possible and that it would exist in just a few decades As AI pioneer Herbert A Simon wrote in 1965 machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do 25 Their predictions were the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C Clarke s character HAL 9000 who embodied what AI researchers believed they could create by the year 2001 AI pioneer Marvin Minsky was a consultant 26 on the project of making HAL 9000 as realistic as possible according to the consensus predictions of the time Crevier quotes him as having said on the subject in 1967 Within a generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved 27 although Minsky states that he was misquoted citation needed However in the early 1970s it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project Funding agencies became skeptical of AGI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful applied AI 28 As the 1980s began Japans Fifth Generation Computer Project revived interest in AGI setting out a tenyear timeline that included AGI goals like carry on a casual conversation 29 In response to this and the success of expert systems both industry and government pumped money back into the field 30 However confidence in AI spectacularly collapsed in the late 1980s and the goals of the Fifth Generation Computer Project were never fulfilled 31 For the second time in 20 years AI researchers who had predicted the imminent achievement of AGI had been shown to be fundamentally mistaken By the 1990s AI researchers had gained a reputation for making vain promises They became reluctant to make predictions at all 32 and to avoid any mention of human level artificial intelligence for fear of being labeled wildeyed dreamers 33 Narrow AI research edit Main article Artificial intelligence In the 1990s and early 21st century mainstream AI has achieved far greater commercial success and academic respectability by focusing on specific subproblems where they can produce verifiable results and commercial applications such as artificial neural networks computer vision or data mining 34 These applied AI systems are now used extensively throughout the technology industry and research in this vein is very heavily funded in both academia and industry Currently the development on this field is considered an emerging trend and a mature stage is expected to happen in more than 10 years 35 Most mainstream AI researchers hope that strong AI can be developed by combining the programs that solve various subproblems using an integrated agent architecture cognitive architecture or subsumption architecture Hans Moravec wrote in 1988 I am confident that this bottomup route to artificial intelligence will one day meet the traditional topdown route more than half way ready to provide the real world competence and the commonsense knowledge that has been so frustratingly elusive in reasoning programs Fully intelligent machines will result when the metaphorical golden spike is driven uniting the two efforts 36 However even this fundamental philosophy has been disputed for example Stevan Harnad of Princeton concluded his 1990 paper on the Symbol Grounding Hypothesis by stating The expectation has often been voiced that topdown symbolic approaches to modeling cognition will somehow meet bottomup sensory approaches somewhere in between If the grounding considerations in this paper are valid then this expectation is hopelessly modular and there is really only one viable route from sense to symbols from the ground up A freefloating symbolic level like the software level of a computer will never be reached by this route or vice versa nor is it clear why we should even try to reach such a level since it looks as if getting there would just amount to uprooting our symbols from their intrinsic meanings thereby merely reducing ourselves to the functional equivalent of a programmable computer 37 Modern artificial general intelligence research edit Artificial general intelligence 38 AGI describes research that aims to create machines capable of general intelligent action The term was used as early as 1997 by Mark Gubrud 39 in a discussion of the implications of fully automated military production and operations The term was reintroduced and popularized by Shane Legg and Ben Goertzel around 2002 40 The research objective is much older for example Doug Lenat s Cyc project that began in 1984 and Allen Newell s Soar project are regarded as within the scope of AGI AGI research activity in 2006 was described by Pei Wang and Ben Goertzel 41 as producing publications and preliminary results The first summer school in AGI was organized in Xiamen China in 2009 by the Xiamen universitys Artificial Brain Laboratory and OpenCog The first university course was given in 2010 and 2011 at Plovdiv University Bulgaria by Todor Arnaudov MIT presented a course in AGI in 2018 organized by Lex Fridman and featuring a number of guest lecturers However as yet most AI researchers have devoted little attention to AGI with some claiming that intelligence is too complex to be completely replicated in the near term However a small number of computer scientists are active in AGI research and many of this group are contributing to a series of AGI conferences The research is extremely diverse and often pioneering in nature In the introduction to his book 38 Goertzel says that estimates of the time needed before a truly flexible AGI is built vary from 10 years to over a century but the consensus in the AGI research community seems to be that the timeline discussed by Ray Kurzweil in The Singularity is Near 42 ie between 2015 and 2045 is plausible 43 However most mainstream AI researchers doubt that progress will be this rapid citation needed Organizations explicitly pursuing AGI include the Swiss AI lab IDSIA citation needed Nnaisense 44 Vicarious Maluuba 9 the OpenCog Foundation Adaptive AI LIDA and Numenta and the associated Redwood Neuroscience Institute 45 In addition organizations such as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute 46 and OpenAI 47 have been founded to influence the development path of AGI Finally projects such as the Human Brain Project 48 have the goal of building a functioning simulation of the human brain A 2017 survey of AGI categorized fortyfive known active RD projects that explicitly or implicitly through published research research AGI with the largest three being DeepMind the Human Brain Project and OpenAI based on article 9 In 2019 video game programmer and aerospace engineer John Carmack announced plans to research AGI DeepMind with their success in Human Player Simulation for eg AlphaGo made use of new concepts Reinforcement learning to improve already trained networks with new data or Unsupervised learning eg by Generative adversarial network to get improved networks by competition Processing power needed to simulate a brain edit Whole brain emulation edit Main article Mind uploading A popular discussed approach to achieving general intelligent action is whole brain emulation A lowlevel brain model is built by scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device The computer runs a simulation model so faithful to the original that it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain or for all practical purposes indistinguishably 49 Whole brain emulation is discussed in computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics in the context of brain simulation for medical research purposes It is discussed in artificial intelligence research 43 as an approach to strong AI Neuroimaging technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly and futurist Ray Kurzweil in the book The Singularity Is Near 42 predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power Early estimates edit Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels from Ray Kurzweil and Anders Sandberg and Nick Bostrom along with the fastest supercomputer from TOP500 mapped by year Note the logarithmic scale and exponential trendline which assumes the computational capacity doubles every 11 years Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation while the Sandberg Bostrom report is less certain about where consciousness arises 50 For lowlevel brain simulation an extremely powerful computer would be required The human brain has a huge number of synapses Each of the 10 11 one hundred billion neurons has on average 7000 synaptic connections synapses to other neurons It has been estimated that the brain of a threeyearold child has about 10 15 synapses 1 quadrillion This number declines with age stabilizing by adulthood Estimates vary for an adult ranging from 10 14 to 510 14 synapses 100 to 500 trillion 51 An estimate of the brains processing power based on a simple switch model for neuron activity is around 10 14 100 trillion synaptic updates per second SUPS 52 In 1997 Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10 16 computations per second cps 53 For comparison if a computation was equivalent to one floating point operation a measure used to rate current supercomputers then 10 16 computations would be equivalent to 10 petaFLOPS achieved in 2011 He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025 if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued Modelling the neurons in more detail edit The artificial neuron model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current artificial neural network implementations is simple compared with biological neurons A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological neurons presently understood only in the broadest of outlines The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological chemical and physical details of neural behaviour especially on a molecular scale would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweils estimate In addition the estimates do not account for glial cells which are at least as numerous as neurons and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 101 and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes 54 Current research edit There are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models implemented on conventional computing architectures The Artificial Intelligence System project implemented nonreal time simulations of a brain with 10 11 neurons in 2005 It took 50 days on a cluster of 27 processors to simulate 1 second of a model 55 The Blue Brain project used one of the fastest supercomputer architectures in the world IBM s Blue Gene platform to create a real time simulation of a single rat neocortical column consisting of approximately 10000 neurons and 10 8 synapses in 2006 56 A longer term goal is to build a detailed functional simulation of the physiological processes in the human brain It is not impossible to build a human brain and we can do it in 10 years Henry Markram director of the Blue Brain Project said in 2009 at the TED conference in Oxford 57 There have also been controversial claims to have simulated a cat brain Neurosilicon interfaces have been proposed as an alternative implementation strategy that may scale better 58 Hans Moravec addressed the above arguments brains are more complicated neurons have to be modeled in more detail in his 1997 paper When will computer hardware match the human brain 59 He measured the ability of existing software to simulate the functionality of neural tissue specifically the retina His results do not depend on the number of glial cells nor on what kinds of processing neurons perform where The actual complexity of modeling biological neurons has been explored in OpenWorm project that was aimed on complete simulation of a worm that has only 302 neurons in its neural network among about 1000 cells in total The animals neural network has been well documented before the start of the project However although the task seemed simple at the beginning the models based on a generic neural network didnt work Currently the efforts are focused on precise emulation of biological neurons partly on the molecular level but the result cant be called a total success yet Even if the number of issues to be solved in a humanbrainscale model is not proportional to the number of neurons the amount of work along this path is obvious Criticisms of simulationbased approaches edit A fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from embodied cognition where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence Many researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning 60 If this view is correct any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons ie a robotic body Goertzel 43 proposes virtual embodiment like in Second Life but it is not yet known whether this would be sufficient Desktop computers using microprocessors capable of more than 10 9 cps Kurzweils nonstandard unit computations per second see above have been available since 2005 According to the brain power estimates used by Kurzweil and Moravec this computer should be capable of supporting a simulation of a bee brain but despite some interest 61 no such simulation exists citation needed There are at least three reasons for this The neuron model seems to be oversimplified see next section There is insufficient understanding of higher cognitive processes 62 to establish accurately what the brains neural activity observed using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging correlates with Even if our understanding of cognition advances sufficiently early simulation programs are likely to be very inefficient and will therefore need considerably more hardware The brain of an organism while critical may not be an appropriate boundary for a cognitive model To simulate a bee brain it may be necessary to simulate the body and the environment The Extended Mind thesis formalizes the philosophical concept and research into cephalopods has demonstrated clear examples of a decentralized system 63 In addition the scale of the human brain is not currently wellconstrained One estimate puts the human brain at about 100 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses 64 65 Another estimate is 86 billion neurons of which 163 billion are in the cerebral cortex and 69 billion in the cerebellum 66 Glial cell synapses are currently unquantified but are known to be extremely numerous Artificial consciousness research edit Main article Artificial consciousness Although the role of consciousness in strong AIAGI is debatable many AGI researchers 67 regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital In an early effort Igor Aleksander 68 argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand language Relationship to strong AI edit See also Philosophy of artificial intelligence Turing test and Chinese room In 1980 philosopher John Searle coined the term strong AI as part of his Chinese room argument 69 He wanted to distinguish between two different hypotheses about artificial intelligence 70 An artificial intelligence system can think and have a mind The word mind has a specific meaning for philosophers as used in the mind body problem or the philosophy of mind An artificial intelligence system can only act like it thinks and has a mind The first one is called the strong AI hypothesis and the second is the weak AI hypothesis because the first one makes the stronger statement it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test Searle referred to the strong AI hypothesis as strong AI This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks 71 The weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible According to Russell and Norvig Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted and dont care about the strong AI hypothesis 72 In contrast to Searle Kurzweil uses the term strong AI to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind 42 regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it actually has a mind or not Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research edit See also History of artificial intelligence The problems Since the launch of AI research in 1956 the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level 73 A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power 73 In addition the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research 73 While most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future there are some individuals like Hubert Dreyfus and Roger Penrose who deny the possibility of achieving strong AI 73 John McCarthy was one of various computer scientists who believe humanlevel AI will be accomplished but a date cannot accurately be predicted 74 Conceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research 73 AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI As William Clocksin wrote in 2003 the framework starts from Weizenbaums observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts 73 Furthermore AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do Moravecs paradox example needed 73 A problem described by David Gelernter is that some people assume thinking and reasoning are equivalent 75 However the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers 75 The problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of humanlevel AI 43 Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century 43 Other possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers from emulating the function of the human brain into a computer hardware 76 Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI but without taking those issues seriously can people then overlook solutions to problematic questions 43 Clocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment 73 When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence a main interest was human reasoning 77 Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task 77 The practice of abstraction which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts 77 The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving 77 Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators 78 A possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance 76 The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers There have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether machines should be created with emotions There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own 73 Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences 75 David Gelernter writes No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion 75 This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future 79 Consciousness edit There are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in science fiction and the ethics of artificial intelligence consciousness To have subjective experience and thought 80 selfawareness To be aware of oneself as a separate individual especially to be aware of ones own thoughts sentience The ability to feel perceptions or emotions subjectively sapience The capacity for wisdom These traits have a moral dimension because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights analogous to the rights of nonhuman animals Also Bill Joy among others argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity 81 It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are necessary for strong AI The role of consciousness is not clear and currently there is no agreed test for its presence If a machine is built with a device that simulates the neural correlates of consciousness would it automatically have selfawareness It is also possible that some of these properties such as sentience naturally emerge from a fully intelligent machine or that it becomes natural to ascribe these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent For example intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience rather than the other way around In science fiction AGI is associated with traits such as consciousness sentience sapience and selfawareness observed in living beings However according to philosopher John Searle it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness Strong AI as defined above by Ray Kurzweil should not be confused with Searles strong AI hypothesis The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a mind and consciousness AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays with or without a mind Controversies and dangers edit Feasibility edit This section needs expansion You can help by adding to it February 2016 Opinions vary both on whether and when artificial general intelligence will arrive At one extreme AI pioneer Herbert A Simon wrote in 1965 machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do However this prediction failed to come true Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen believed that such intelligence is unlikely in the 21st century because it would require unforeseeable and fundamentally unpredictable breakthroughs and a scientifically deep understanding of cognition 82 Writing in The Guardian roboticist Alan Winfield claimed the gulf between modern computing and humanlevel artificial intelligence is as wide as the gulf between current space flight and practical fasterthanlight spaceflight 83 AI experts views on the feasibility of AGI wax and wane and may have seen a resurgence in the 2010s Four polls conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggested that the median guess among experts for when theyd be 50 confident AGI would arrive was 2040 to 2050 depending on the poll with the mean being 2081 It is also interesting to note 165 of the experts answered with never when asked the same question but with a 90 confidence instead 84 85 Further current AGI progress considerations can be found below Tests for confirming humanlevel AGI and IQtests AGI Potential threat to human existence edit Main article Existential risk from artificial general intelligence See also Technological singularity The creation of artificial general intelligence may have repercussions so great and so complex that it may not be possible to forecast what will come afterwards Thus the event in the hypothetical future of achieving strong AI is called the technological singularity because theoretically one cannot see past it But this has not stopped philosophers and researchers from guessing what the smart computers or robots of the future may do including forming a utopia by being our friends or overwhelming us in an AI takeover The latter potentiality is particularly disturbing as it poses an existential risk for mankind Selfreplicating machines edit Photo of robot Pepper Smart computers or robots would be able to design and produce improved versions of themselves 86 A growing population of intelligent robots could conceivably outcompete inferior humans in job markets in business in science in politics pursuing robot rights and technologically sociologically by acting as one and militarily Even nowadays many jobs have already been taken by pseudointelligent machines powered by a Weak AI For example robots for homes health care hotels and restaurants have automated many parts of our lives virtual bots turn customer service into selfservice big data AI applications are used to replace portfolio managers and social robots such as Pepper are used to replace human greeters for customer service purpose 87 Emergent superintelligence edit If research into strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software it would be able to reprogram and improve itself a feature called recursive selfimprovement It would then be even better at improving itself and would probably continue doing so in a rapidly increasing cycle leading to an intelligence explosion and the emergence of superintelligence Such an intelligence would not have the limitations of human intellect and might be able to invent or discover almost anything Hyperintelligent software might not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of mankind and might be extremely difficult to stop 88 This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization humans and planet Earth One proposal to deal with this is to make sure that the first generally intelligent AI is a friendly AI that would then endeavor to ensure that subsequently developed AIs were also nice to us But friendly AI is harder to create than plain AGI and therefore it is likely in a race between the two that nonfriendly AI would be developed first Also there is no guarantee that friendly AI would remain friendly or that its progeny would also all be good 89 See also edit Automated machine

that consciousness is difficult to define A popular definition due to Thomas Nagel is that it feels like something to be conscious If we are not conscious then it doesnt feel like anything Nagel uses the example of a bat we can sensibly ask what does it feel like to be a bat However we are unlikely to ask what does it feel like to be a toaster Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious ie has consciousness but a toaster does not See Nagel 1974 Joy Bill April 2000 Why the future doesnt need us Wired Allen Paul The Singularity Isnt Near MIT Technology Review Retrieved 17 September 2014
