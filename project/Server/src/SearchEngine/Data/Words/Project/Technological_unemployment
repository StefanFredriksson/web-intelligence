Technological unemployment Unemployment primarily caused by technological change In the 21st century robots are beginning to perform roles not just in manufacturing but in the service sector eg in healthcare Technological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change It is a key type of structural unemployment Technological change typically includes the introduction of laboursaving mechanicalmuscle machines or more efficient mechanicalmind processes automation Just as horses employed as prime movers were gradually made obsolete by the automobile humans jobs have also been affected throughout modern history Historical examples include artisan weavers reduced to poverty after the introduction of mechanized looms During World War II Alan Turing s Bombe machine compressed and decoded thousands of manyears worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by selfservice tills That technological change can cause shortterm job losses is widely accepted The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists Optimists agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a longterm negative impact on jobs whereas pessimists contend that at least in some circumstances new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment The phrase technological unemployment was popularised by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s who said it was a only a temporary phase of maladjustment 1 Yet the issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least Aristotle s time Prior to the 18th century both the elite and common people would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment at least in cases where the issue arose Due to generally low unemployment in much of premodern history the topic was rarely a prominent concern In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the classical economists During the second half of the 19th century it became increasingly apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society including the working class Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished The term Luddite fallacy was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment The view that technology is unlikely to lead to long term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists In the early 1800s these included Ricardo himself There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s Especially in Europe there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century In the second decade of the 21st century a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may be increasing worldwide Oxford Professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne for example have estimated that 47 percent of US jobs are at risk of automation 2 However their findings have frequently been misinterpreted and on the PBS NewsHours they again made clear that their findings do not necessarily imply future technological unemployment 3 While many economists and commentators still argue such fears are unfounded as was widely accepted for most of the previous two centuries concern over technological unemployment is growing once again 4 5 6 A report in Wired in 2017 quotes knowledgeable people such as economist Gene Sperling and management professor Andrew McAfee on the idea that handling existing and impending job loss to automation is a significant issue 7 Regarding a recent claim by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that automation is not going to have any kind of big effect on the economy for the next 50 or 100 years says McAfee I dont talk to anyone in the field who believes that 7 Recent technological innovations have the potential to render humans obsolete with the professional whitecollar lowskilled creative fields and other mental jobs 8 9 The World Bank s World Development Report 2019 argues that while automation displaces workers technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance 10 Contents 1 Issues within the debates 11 Long term effects on

generalpurpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever Lawrence Summers 11 All participants in the technological employment debates agree that temporary job losses can result from technological innovation Similarly there is no dispute that innovation sometimes has positive effects on workers Disagreement focuses on whether it is possible for innovation to have a lasting negative impact on overall employment Levels of persistent unemployment can be quantified empirically but the causes are subject to debate Optimists accept short term unemployment may be caused by innovation yet claim that after a while compensation effects will always create at least as many jobs as were originally destroyed While this optimistic view has been continually challenged it was dominant among mainstream economists for most of the 19th and 20th centuries 12 13 For example labor economists Jacob Mincer and Stephan Danninger develop an empirical study using microdata from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and find that although in the short run technological progress seems to have unclear effects on aggregate unemployment it reduces unemployment in the long run When they include a 5year lag however the evidence supporting a shortrun employment effect of technology seems to disappear as well suggesting that technological unemployment appears to be a myth 14 The concept of structural unemployment a lasting level of joblessness that does not disappear even at the high point of the business cycle became popular in the 1960s For pessimists technological unemployment is one of the factors driving the wider phenomena of structural unemployment Since the 1980s even optimistic economists have increasingly accepted that structural unemployment has indeed risen in advanced economies but they have tended to blame this on globalisation and offshoring rather than technological change Others claim a chief cause of the lasting increase in unemployment has been the reluctance of governments to pursue expansionary policies since the displacement of Keynesianism that occurred in the 1970s and early 80s 12 15 16 In the 21st century and especially since 2013 pessimists have been arguing with increasing frequency that lasting worldwide technological unemployment is a growing threat 13 17 18 19 Compensation effects edit John Kay inventor of the Fly Shuttle AD 1753 by Ford Madox Brown depicting the inventor John Kay kissing his wife goodbye as men carry him away from his home to escape a mob angry about his laboursaving mechanical loom Compensation effects were not widely understood at this time Compensation effects are labourfriendly consequences of innovation which compensate workers for job losses initially caused by new technology In the 1820s several compensation effects were described by Say in response to Ricardos statement that long term technological unemployment could occur Soon after a whole system of effects was developed by Ramsey McCulloch The system was labelled compensation theory by Marx who proceeded to attack the ideas arguing that none of the effects were guaranteed to operate Disagreement over the effectiveness of compensation effects has remained a central part of academic debates on technological unemployment ever since 16 20 Compensation effects include By new machines The labour needed to build the new equipment that applied innovation requires By new investments Enabled by the cost savings and therefore increased profits from the new technology By changes in wages In cases where unemployment does occur this can cause a lowering of wages thus allowing more workers to be reemployed at the now lower cost On the other hand sometimes workers will enjoy wage increases as their profitability rises This leads to increased income and therefore increased spending which in turn encourages job creation By lower prices Which then lead to more demand and therefore more employment Lower prices can also help offset wage cuts as cheaper goods will increase workers buying power By new products Where innovation directly creates new jobs The by new machines effect is now rarely discussed by economists it is often accepted that Marx successfully refuted it 16 Even pessimists often concede that product innovation associated with the by new products effect can sometimes have a positive effect on employment An important distinction can be drawn between process and product innovations note 1 Evidence from Latin America seems to suggest that product innovation significantly contributes to the employment growth at the firm level more so than process innovation 21 The extent to which the other effects are successful in compensating the workforce for job losses has been extensively debated throughout the history of modern economics the issue is still not resolved 16 22 One such effect that potentially complements the compensation effect is job multiplier According to research developed by Enrico Moretti with each additional skilled job created in high tech industries in a given city more than two jobs are created in the nontradable sector His findings suggest that technological growth and the resulting jobcreation in hightech industries might have a more significant spillover effect than we have anticipated 23 Evidence from Europe also supports such a job multiplier effect showing local hightech jobs could create five additional lowtech jobs 24 Many economists now pessimistic about technological unemployment accept that compensation effects did largely operate as the optimists claimed through most of the 19th and 20th century Yet they hold that the advent of computerisation means that compensation effects are now less effective An early example of this argument was made by Wassily Leontief in 1983 He conceded that after some disruption the advance of mechanization during the Industrial Revolution actually increased the demand for labour as well as increasing pay due to effects that flow from increased productivity While early machines lowered the demand for muscle power they were unintelligent and needed large armies of human operators to remain productive Yet since the introduction of computers into the workplace there is now less need not just for muscle power but also for human brain power Hence even as productivity continues to rise the lower demand for human labour may mean less pay and employment 16 18 25 However this argument is not fully supported by more recent empirical studies One research done by Erik Brynjolfsson and Lorin M Hitt in 2003 presents direct evidence that suggests a positive shortterm effect of computerization on firmlevel measured productivity and output growth In addition they find the longterm productivity contribution of computerization and technological changes might even be greater The Luddite fallacy edit If the Luddite fallacy were true we would all be out of work because productivity has been increasing for two centuries Alex Tabarrok 26 The term Luddite fallacy is sometimes used to express the view that those concerned about long term technological unemployment are committing a fallacy as they fail to account for compensation effects People who use the term typically expect that technological progress will have no long term impact on employment levels and eventually will raise wages for all workers because progress helps to increase the overall wealth of society The term is based on the early 19th century example of the Luddites During the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century the dominant view among economists has been that belief in long term technological unemployment was indeed a fallacy More recently there has been increased support for the view that the benefits of automation are not equally distributed 13 27 28 There are two underlying premises for why longterm difficulty could develop The one that has traditionally been deployed is that ascribed to the Luddites whether or not it is a truly accurate summary of their thinking which is that there is a finite amount of work available and if machines do that work there can be no other work left for humans to do Economists call this the lump of labour fallacy arguing that in reality no such limitation exists However the other premise is that it is possible for longterm difficulty to arise that has nothing to do with any lump of labour In this view the amount of work that can exist is infinite but 1 machines can do most of the easy work 2 the definition of what is easy expands as information technology progresses and 3 the work that lies beyond easy the work that requires more skill talent knowledge and insightful connections between pieces of knowledge may require greater cognitive faculties than most humans are able to supply as point 2 continually advances This latter view is the one supported by many modern advocates of the possibility of longterm systemic technological unemployment Skill levels and technological unemployment edit A common view among those discussing the effect of innovation on the labour market has been that it mainly hurts those with low skills while often benefiting skilled workers According to scholars such as Lawrence F Katz this may have been true for much of the twentieth century yet in the 19th century innovations in the workplace largely displaced costly skilled artisans and generally benefited the low skilled While 21st century innovation has been replacing some unskilled work other low skilled occupations remain resistant to automation while white collar work requiring intermediate skills is increasingly being performed by autonomous computer programs 29 30 31 Some recent studies however such as a 2015 paper by Georg Graetz and Guy Michaels found that at least in the area they studied the impact of industrial robots innovation is boosting pay for highly skilled workers while having a more negative impact on those with low to medium skills 32 A 2015 report by Carl Benedikt Frey Michael Osborne and Citi Research agreed that innovation had been disruptive mostly to middleskilled jobs yet predicted that in the next ten years the impact of automation would fall most heavily on those with low skills 33 Geoff Colvin at Forbes argued that predictions on the kind of work a computer will never be able to do have proven inaccurate A better approach to anticipate the skills on which humans will provide value would be to find out activities where we will insist that humans remain accountable for important decisions such as with judges CEOs bus drivers and government leaders or where human nature can only be satisfied by deep interpersonal connections even if those tasks could be automated 34 In contrast others see even skilled human laborers being obsolete Oxford academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne have predicted computerization could make nearly half of jobs redundant 35 of the 702 professions assessed they found a strong correlation between education and income with ability to be automated with office jobs and service work being some of the more at risk 36 In 2012 cofounder of Sun Microsystems Vinod Khosla predicted that 80 of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software 37 Empirical findings edit There has been a lot of empirical research that attempts to quantify the impact of technological unemployment mostly done at the microeconomic level Most existing firmlevel research has found a laborfriendly nature of technological innovations For example German economists Stefan Lachenmaier and Horst Rottmann find that both product and process innovation have a positive effect on employment They also find that process innovation has a more significant job creation effect than product innovation 38 This result is supported by evidence in the United States as well which shows that manufacturing firm innovations have a positive effect on the total number of jobs not just limited to firmspecific behavior 39 At the industry level however researchers have found mixed results with regard to the employment effect of technological changes A 2017 study on manufacturing and service sectors in 11 European countries suggests that positive employment effects of technological innovations only exist in the medium and hightech sectors There also seems to be a negative correlation between employment and capital formation which suggests that technological progress could potentially be laborsaving given that process innovation is often incorporated in investment 40 Limited macroeconomic analysis has been done to study the relationship between technological shocks and unemployment The small amount of existing research however suggests mixed results Italian economist Marco Vivarelli finds that the laborsaving effect of process innovation seems to have affected the Italian economy more negatively than the United States On the other hand the job creating effect of product innovation could only be observed in the United States not Italy 41 Another study in 2013 finds a more transitory rather than permanent unemployment effect of technological change 42 Measures of technological innovation edit There have been four main approaches that attempt to capture and document technological innovation quantitatively The first one proposed by Jordi Gali in 1999 and further developed by Neville Francis and Valerie A Ramey in 2005 is to use longrun restrictions in a Vector Autoregression VAR to identify technological shocks assuming that only technology affects longrun productivity 43 44 The second approach is from Susanto Basu John Fernald and Miles Kimball 45 They create a measure of aggregate technology change with augmented Solow residuals controlling for aggregate nontechnological effects such as nonconstant returns and imperfect competition The third method initially developed by John Shea in 1999 takes a more direct approach and employs observable indicators such as Research and Development RD spending and number of patent applications 46 This measure of technological innovation is very widely used in empirical research since it does not rely on the assumption that only technology affects longrun productivity and fairly accurately captures the output variation based on input variation However there are limitations with direct measures such as RD For example since RD only measures the input in innovation the output is unlikely to be perfectly correlated with the input In addition RD fails to capture the indeterminate lag between developing a new product or service and bringing it to market 47 The fourth approach constructed by Michelle Alexopoulos looks at the number of new titles published in the fields of technology and computer science to reflect technological progress which turns out to be consistent with RD expenditure data 48 Compared with RD this indicator captures the lag between changes in technology History edit Pre16th century edit Roman Emperor Vespasian who refused a lowcost method of transport of heavy goods that would put laborers out of work The fear of unemployment due to some sort of technological change has always seen as a threat of sorts Even Plato feared that reading would substitute true knowledge with mere data 49 According to author Gregory Woirol the phenomenon of technological unemployment is likely to have existed since at least the invention of the wheel 50 Ancient societies had various methods for relieving the poverty of those unable to support themselves with their own labour Ancient China and ancient Egypt may have had various centrally run relief programmes in response to technological unemployment dating back to at least the second millennium BC 51 Ancient Hebrews and adherents of the ancient Vedic religion had decentralised responses where aiding the poor was encouraged by their faiths 51 In ancient Greece large numbers of free labourers could find themselves unemployed due to both the effects of ancient labour saving technology and to competition from slaves machines of flesh and blood 52 Sometimes these unemployed workers would starve to death or were forced into slavery themselves although in other cases they were supported by handouts Pericles responded to perceived technological unemployment by launching public works programmes to provide paid work to the jobless Conservatives criticized Pericles programmes for wasting public money but were defeated 53 Perhaps the earliest example of a scholar discussing the phenomenon of technological unemployment occurs with Aristotle who speculated in Book One of Politics that if machines could become sufficiently advanced there would be no more need for human labour 54 Similar to the Greeks ancient Romans responded to the problem of technological unemployment by relieving poverty with handouts Several hundred thousand families were sometimes supported like this at once 51 Less often jobs were directly created with public works programmes such as those launched by the Gracchi Various emperors even went as far as to refuse or ban labour saving innovations 55 56 In one instance the introduction of a laborsaving invention was blocked when Emperor Vespasian refused to allow a new method of lowcost transportation of heavy goods saying You must allow my poor hauliers to earn their bread 57 Labour shortages began to develop in the Roman empire towards the end of the second century AD and from this point mass unemployment in Europe appears to have largely receded for over a millennium 58 The medieval and early renaissance period saw the widespread adoption of newly invented technologies as well as older ones which had been conceived yet barely used in the Classical era 59 Mass unemployment began to reappear in Europe in the 15th century partly as a result of population growth and partly due to changes in the availability of land for subsistence farming caused by early enclosures 60 As a result of the threat of unemployment there was less tolerance for disruptive new technologies European authorities would often side with groups representing subsections of the working population such as Guilds banning new technologies and sometimes even executing those who tried to promote or trade in them 61 16th to 18th century edit Elizabeth I who refused to patent a knitting machine invented by William Lee saying Consider thou what the invention could do to my poor subjects It would assuredly bring them to ruin by depriving them of employment thus making them beggars In Great Britain the ruling elite began to take a less restrictive approach to innovation somewhat earlier than in much of continental Europe which has been cited as a possible reason for Britains early lead in driving the Industrial Revolution 62 Yet concern over the impact of innovation on employment remained strong through the 16th and early 17th century A famous example of new technology being refused occurred when the inventor William Lee invited Queen Elizabeth I to view a labour saving knitting machine The Queen declined to issue a patent on the grounds that the technology might cause unemployment among textile workers After moving to France and also failing to achieve success in promoting his invention Lee returned to England but was again refused by Elizabeths successor James I for the same reason 18 Especially after the Glorious Revolution authorities became less sympathetic to workers concerns about losing their jobs due to innovation An increasingly influential strand of Mercantilist thought held that introducing labour saving technology would actually reduce unemployment as it would allow British firms to increase their market share against foreign competition From the early 18th century workers could no longer rely on support from the authorities against the perceived threat of technological unemployment They would sometimes take direct action such as machine breaking in attempts to protect themselves from disruptive innovation Schumpeter notes that as the 18th century progressed thinkers would raise the alarm about technological unemployment with increasing frequency with von Justi being a prominent example 63 Yet Schumpeter also notes that the prevailing view among the elite solidified on the position that technological unemployment would not be a long term problem 18 60 19th century edit It was only in the 19th century that debates over technological unemployment became intense especially in Great Britain where many economic thinkers of the time were concentrated Building on the work of Dean Tucker and Adam Smith political economists began to create what would become the modern discipline of economics note 2 While rejecting much of mercantilism members of the new discipline largely agreed that technological unemployment would not be an enduring problem In the first few decades of the 19th century several prominent political economists did however argue against the optimistic view claiming that innovation could cause longterm unemployment These included Sismondi 64 Malthus J S Mill and from 1821 Ricardo himself 65 As arguably the most respected political economist of his age Ricardos view was challenging to others in the discipline The first major economist to respond was JeanBaptiste Say who argued that no one would introduce machinery if they were going to reduce the amount of product note 3 and that as Says Law states that supply creates its own demand any displaced workers would automatically find work elsewhere once the market had had time to adjust 66 Ramsey McCulloch expanded and formalised Says optimistic views on technological unemployment and was supported by others such as Charles Babbage Nassau Senior and many other lesser known political economists Towards the middle of the 19th century Karl Marx joined the debates Building on the work of Ricardo and Mill Marx went much further presenting a deeply pessimistic view of technological unemployment his views attracted many followers and founded an enduring school of thought but mainstream economics was not dramatically changed By the 1870s at least in Great Britain technological unemployment faded both as a popular concern and as an issue for academic debate It had become increasingly apparent that innovation was increasing prosperity for all sections of British society including the working class As the classical school of thought gave way to neoclassical economics mainstream thinking was tightened to take into account and refute the pessimistic arguments of Mill and Ricardo 67 20th century edit Critics of the view that innovation causes lasting unemployment argue that technology is used by workers and does not replace them on a large scale For the first two decades of the 20th century mass unemployment was not the major problem it had been in the first half of the 19th While the Marxist school and a few other thinkers still challenged the optimistic view technological unemployment was not a significant concern for mainstream economic thinking until the mid to late 1920s In the 1920s mass unemployment reemerged as a pressing issue within Europe At this time the US was generally more prosperous but even there urban unemployment had begun to increase from 1927 Rural American workers had been suffering job losses from the start of the 1920s many had been displaced by improved agricultural technology such as the tractor The centre of gravity for economic debates had by this time moved from Great Britain to the United States and it was here that the 20th centurys two great periods of debate over technological unemployment largely occurred 68 The peak periods for the two debates were in the 1930s and the 1960s According to economic historian Gregory R Woirol the two episodes share several similarities 69 In both cases academic debates were preceded by an outbreak of popular concern sparked by recent rises in unemployment In both cases the debates were not conclusively settled but faded away as unemployment was reduced by an outbreak of war World War II for the debate of the 1930s and the Vietnam war for the 1960s episodes In both cases the debates were conducted within the prevailing paradigm at the time with little reference to earlier thought In the 1930s optimists based their arguments largely on neoclassical beliefs in the selfcorrecting power of markets to automatically reduce any shortterm unemployment via compensation effects In the 1960s faith in compensation effects was less strong but the mainstream Keynesian economists of the time largely believed government intervention would be able to counter any persistent technological unemployment that was not cleared by market forces Another similarity was the publication of a major Federal study towards the end of each episode which broadly found that longterm technological unemployment was not occurring though the studies did agree innovation was a major factor in the short term displacement of workers and advised government action to provide assistance note 4 69 As the golden age of capitalism came to a close in the 1970s unemployment once again rose and this time generally remained relatively high for the rest of the century across most advanced economies Several economists once again argued that this may be due to innovation with perhaps the most prominent being Paul Samuelson 70 A number of popular works warning of technological unemployment were also published These included James S Albus s 1976 book titled Peoples Capitalism The Economics of the Robot Revolution 71 72 David F Noble with works published in 1984 73 and 1993 74 Jeremy Rifkin and his 1995 book The End of Work 75 and the 1996 book The Global Trap 76 In general the closing decades of the 20th century saw much more concern expressed over technological unemployment in Europe compared with the US 77 For the most part other than during the periods of intense debate in the 1930s and 60s the consensus in the 20th century among both professional economists and the general public remained that technology does not cause longterm joblessness 78 21st century edit Artificial Intelligence AI edit There is debate about the effects AI will have on the job market Many civilians think that AI will eventually lead to technological employment However Frank et al states that there are three main barriers that prevent researchers from making predictions of the effects AI will have on the future job marker First there is limited data on what makes each job separate from each other especially in middleclass jobs In some cases the skills needed for a job is unclear This makes in difficult because specifics on tasks is essential to choosing what jobs are AIcompatible If researchers are unable to see what jobs will be impacted then they can do little except generalize what will happen Second there is limited modeling of resilience Since AI is a new technology there are no past records to consult for trends Therefore it is difficult to predict how the economy and labor market will react Third many researchers look at the country when predicting these changes However since the country is so big there are inevitably places that are more susceptible to technological changes than others Mainly cities can easily insert jobs for machines but towns in farmland states will find it harder Because of this vast difference in various places researchers must consider differences 49 In addition the jobs that will most likely be completely replaced by AI are middleclass jobs such as factory jobs Often the practical solution is to find another job but usually workers do not have the qualifications for highlevel jobs and must drop to lowlevel jobs However Krakovsky 2018 states that AI will most likely take the route of complementing people rather than replicating people Meaning that the goal of AI is to improve the life of workers not become them 79 Opinions edit There is a prevailing opinion that we are in an era of technological unemployment that technology is increasingly making skilled workers obsolete Prof Mark MacCarthy 2014 80 The general consensus that innovation does not cause longterm unemployment held strong for the first decade of the 21st century although it continued to be challenged by a number of academic works 16 22 and by popular works such as Marshall Brain s Robotic Nation 81 and Martin Ford s The Lights in the Tunnel Automation Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future 82 Since the publication of their 2011 book Race Against The Machine MIT professors Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson have been prominent among those raising concern about technological unemployment The two professors remain relatively optimistic however stating the key to winning the race is not to compete against machines but to compete with machines 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 Concern about technological unemployment grew in 2013 due in part to a number of studies predicting substantially increased technological unemployment in forthcoming decades and empirical evidence that in certain sectors employment is falling worldwide despite rising output thus discounting globalization and offshoring as the only causes of increasing unemployment 17 18 90 In 2013 professor Nick Bloom of Stanford University stated there had recently been a major change of heart concerning technological unemployment among his fellow economists 91 In 2014 the Financial Times reported that the impact of innovation on jobs has been a dominant theme in recent economic discussion 92 According to the academic and former politician Michael Ignatieff writing in 2014 questions concerning the effects of technological change have been haunting democratic politics everywhere 93 Concerns have included evidence showing worldwide falls in employment across sectors such as manufacturing falls in pay for low and medium skilled workers stretching back several decades even as productivity continues to rise the increase in often precarious platform mediated employment and the occurrence of jobless recoveries after recent recessions The 21st century has seen a variety of skilled tasks partially taken over by machines including translation legal research and even low level journalism Care work entertainment and other tasks requiring empathy previously thought safe from automation have also begun to be performed by robots 17 18 94 95 96 97 Former US Treasury Secretary and Harvard economics professor Lawrence Summers stated in 2014 that he no longer believed automation would always create new jobs and that This isnt some hypothetical future possibility This is something thats emerging before us right now Summers noted that already more labor sectors were losing jobs than creating new ones note 5 11 98 99 100 While himself doubtful about technological unemployment professor Mark MacCarthy stated in the fall of 2014 that it is now the prevailing opinion that the era of technological unemployment has arrived 80 At the 2014 Davos meeting Thomas Friedman reported that the link between technology and unemployment seemed to have been the dominant theme of that years discussions A survey at Davos 2014 found that 80 of 147 respondents agreed that technology was driving jobless growth 101 At the 2015 Davos Gillian Tett found that almost all delegates attending a discussion on inequality and technology expected an increase in inequality over the next five years and gives the reason for this as the technological displacement of jobs 102 2015 saw Martin Ford win the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award for his Rise of the Robots Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future and saw the first world summit on technological unemployment held in New York In late 2015 further warnings of potential worsening for technological unemployment came from Andy Haldane the Bank of England s chief economist and from Ignazio Visco the governor of the Bank of Italy 103 104 In an October 2016 interview US President Barack Obama said that due to the growth of artificial intelligence society would be debating unconditional free money for everyone within 10 to 20 years 105 In 2019 computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert Stuart J Russell stated that in the long run nearly all current jobs will go away so we need fairly radical policy changes to prepare for a very different future economy In a book he authored Russell claims that One rapidly emerging picture is that of an economy where far fewer people work because work is unnecessary However he predicted that employment in healthcare home care and construction would increase 106 Other economists however have argued that longterm technological unemployment is unlikely In 2014 Pew Research canvassed 1896 technology professionals and economists and found a split of opinion 48 of respondents believed that new technologies would displace more jobs than they would create by the year 2025 while 52 maintained that they would not 107 Economics professor Bruce Chapman from Australian National University has advised that studies such as Frey and Osbornes tend to overstate the probability of future job losses as they dont account for new employment likely to be created due to technology in what are currently unknown areas 108 General public surveys have often found an expectation that automation would impact jobs widely but not the jobs held by those particular people surveyed 109 Studies edit A number of studies have predicted that automation will take a large proportion of jobs in the future but estimates of the level of unemployment this will cause vary Research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of the Oxford Martin School showed that employees engaged in tasks following welldefined procedures that can easily be performed by sophisticated algorithms are at risk of displacement The study published in 2013 shows that automation can affect both skilled and unskilled work and both high and lowpaying occupations however lowpaid physical occupations are most at risk It estimated that 47 of US jobs were at high risk of automation 18 In 2014 the economic think tank Bruegel released a study based on the Frey and Osborne approach claiming that across the European Union s 28 member states 54 of jobs were at risk of automation The countries where jobs were least vulnerable to automation were Sweden with 4669 of jobs vulnerable the UK at 4717 the Netherlands at 4950 and France and Denmark both at 4954 The countries where jobs were found to be most vulnerable were Romania at 6193 Portugal at 5894 Croatia at 579 and Bulgaria at 5656 110 111 A 2015 report by the Taub Center found that 41 of jobs in Israel were at risk of being automated within the next two decades 112 In January 2016 a joint study by the Oxford Martin School and Citibank based on previous studies on automation and data from the World Bank found that the risk of automation in developing countries was much higher than in developed countries It found that 77 of jobs in China 69 of jobs in India 85 of jobs in Ethiopia and 55 of jobs in Uzbekistan were at risk of automation 113 The World Bank similarly employed the methodology of Frey and Osborne A 2016 study by the International Labour Organization found 74 of salaried electrical electronics industry positions in Thailand 75 of salaried electrical electronics industry positions in Vietnam 63 of salaried electrical electronics industry positions in Indonesia and 81 of salaried electrical electronics industry positions in the Philippines were at high risk of automation 114 A 2016 United Nations report stated that 75 of jobs in the developing world were at risk of automation and predicted that more jobs might be lost when corporations stop outsourcing to developing countries after automation in industrialized countries makes it less lucrative to outsource to countries with lower labor costs 115 The Council of Economic Advisers a US government agency tasked with providing economic research for the White House in the 2016 Economic Report of the President used the data from the Frey and Osborne study to estimate that 83 of jobs with an hourly wage below 20 31 of jobs with an hourly wage between 20 and 40 and 4 of jobs with an hourly wage above 40 were at risk of automation 116 A 2016 study by Ryerson University found that 42 of jobs in Canada were at risk of automation dividing them into two categories high risk jobs and low risk jobs High risk jobs were mainly lowerincome jobs that required lower education levels than average Low risk jobs were on average more skilled positions The report found a 70 chance that high risk jobs and a 30 chance that low risk jobs would be affected by automation in the next 1020 years 117 A 2017 study by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that up to 38 of jobs in the US 35 of jobs in Germany 30 of jobs in the UK and 21 of jobs in Japan were at high risk of being automated by the early 2030s 118 A 2017 study by Ball State University found about half of American jobs were at risk of automation many of them lowincome jobs 119 A September 2017 report by McKinsey Company found that as of 2015 478 billion out of 749 billion working hours per year dedicated to manufacturing or 27 trillion out of 51 trillion in labor were already automatable In lowskill areas 82 of labor in apparel goods 80 of agriculture processing 76 of food manufacturing and 60 of beverage manufacturing were subject to automation In midskill areas 72 of basic materials production and 70 of furniture manufacturing was automatable In highskill areas 52 of aerospace and defense labor and 50 of advanced electronics labor could be automated 120 In October 2017 a survey of information technology decision makers in the US and UK found that a majority believed that most business processes could be automated by 2022 On average they said that 59of business processes were subject to automation 121 A November 2017 report by the McKinsey Global Institute that analyzed around 800 occupations in 46 countries estimated that between 400 million and 800 million jobs could be lost due to robotic automation by 2030 It estimated that jobs were more at risk in developed countries than developing countries due to a greater availability of capital to invest in automation 122 Job losses and downward mobility blamed on automation has been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist and protectionist politics in the US UK and France among other countries 123 124 125 126 127 However not all recent empirical studies have found evidence to support the idea that automation will cause widespread unemployment A study released in 2015 examining the impact of industrial robots in 17 countries between 1993 and 2007 found no overall reduction in employment was caused by the robots and that there was a slight increase in overall wages 32 According to a study published in McKinsey Quarterly 128 in 2015 the impact of computerization in most cases is not replacement of employees but automation of portions of the tasks they perform 129 A 2016 OECD study found that among the 21 OECD countries surveyed on average only 9 of jobs were in foreseeable danger of automation but this varied greatly among countries for example in South Korea the figure of atrisk jobs was 6 while in Austria it was 12 130 In contrast to other studies the OECD study does not primarily base its assessment on the tasks that a job entails but also includes demographic variables including sex education and age It is not clear however why a job should be more or less automatise just because it is performed by a woman In 2017 Forrester estimated that automation would result in a net loss of about 7 of jobs in the US by 2027 replacing 17 of jobs while creating new jobs equivalent to 10 of the workforce 131 Another study argued that the risk of US jobs to automation had been overestimated due to factors such as the heterogeneity of tasks within occupations and the adaptability of jobs being neglected The study found that once this was taken into account the number of occupations at risk to automation in the US drops ceteris paribus from 38 to 9 132 A 2017 study on the effect of automation on Germany found no evidence that automation caused total job losses but that they do effect the jobs people are employed in losses in the industrial sector due to automation were offset by gains in the service sector Manufacturing workers were also not at risk from automation and were in fact more likely to remain employed though not necessarily doing the same tasks However automation did result in a decrease in labours income share as it raised productivity but not wages 133 A 2018 Brookings Institution study that analyzed 28 industries in 18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2018 found that automation was responsible for holding down wages Although it concluded that automation did not reduce the overall number of jobs available and even increased them it found that from the 1970s to the 2010s it had reduced the share of human labor in the value added to the work and thus had helped to slow wage growth 134 In April 2018 Adair Turner former Chairman of the Financial Services Authority and head of the Institute for New Economic Thinking stated that it would already be possible to automate 50 of jobs with current technology and that it will be possible to automate all jobs by 2060 135 Policy edit In 2017 South Korea became the most automated country on earth with one robot for every 19 employed humans This caused the government to consider changing the tax laws to hinder future automation increases 136 Solutions edit Preventing net job losses edit Banningrefusing innovation edit What I object to is the craze for machinery not machinery as such The craze is for what they call laboursaving machinery Men go on saving labour till thousands are without work and thrown on the open streets to die of starvation Gandhi 1924 137 Historically innovations were sometimes banned due to concerns about their impact on employment Since the development of modern economics however this option has generally not even been considered as a solution at least not for the advanced economies Even commentators who are pessimistic about longterm technological unemployment invariably consider innovation to be an overall benefit to society with JS Mill being perhaps the only prominent western political economist to have suggested prohibiting the use of technology as a possible solution to unemployment 20 Gandhian economics called for a delay in the uptake of labour saving machines until unemployment was alleviated however this advice was largely rejected by Nehru who was to become prime minister once India achieved its independence The policy of slowing the introduction of innovation so as to avoid technological unemployment was however implemented in the 20th century within China under Mao s administration 138 139 140 Shorter working hours edit In 1870 the average American worker clocked up about 75 hours per week Just prior to World War II working hours had fallen to about 42 per week and the fall was similar in other advanced economies According to Wassily Leontief this was a voluntary increase in technological unemployment The reduction in working hours helped share out available work and was favoured by workers who were happy to reduce hours to gain extra leisure as innovation was at the time generally helping to increase their rates of pay 25 Further reductions in working hours have been proposed as a possible solution to unemployment by economists including John R Commons Lord Keynes and Luigi Pasinetti Yet once working hours have reached about 40 hours per week workers have been less enthusiastic about further reductions both to prevent loss of income and as many value engaging in work for its own sake Generally 20thcentury economists had argued against further reductions as a solution to unemployment saying it reflects a Lump of labour fallacy 141 In 2014 Googles cofounder Larry Page suggested a fourday workweek so as technology continues to displace jobs more people can find employment 98 142 143 Public works edit Programmes of public works have traditionally been used as way for governments to directly boost employment though this has often been opposed by some but not all conservatives JeanBaptiste Say although generally associated with free market economics advised that public works could be a solution to technological unemployment 144 Some commentators such as professor Mathew Forstater have advised that public works and guaranteed jobs in the public sector may be the ideal solution to technological unemployment as unlike welfare or guaranteed income schemes they provide people with the social recognition and meaningful engagement that comes with work 145 146 For less developed economies public works may be an easier to administrate solution compared to universal welfare programmes 25 As of 2015 calls for public works in the advanced economies have been less frequent even from progressives due to concerns about sovereign debt citation needed A partial exception is for spending on infrastructure which has been recommended as a solution to technological unemployment even by economists previously associated with a neoliberal agenda such as Larry Summers 147 Education edit Improved availability to quality education including skills training for adults and other active labour market policies is a solution that in principle at least is not opposed by any side of the political spectrum and welcomed even by those who are optimistic about longterm technological employment Improved education paid for by government tends to be especially popular with industry Proponents of this brand of policy assert higher level more specialized learning is a way to capitalize from the growing technology industry Leading technology research university MIT published an open letter to policymakers advocating for the reinvention of education namely a shift away from rote learning and towards STEM disciplines 148 Similar statements released by the US Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology PACST have also been used to support this STEM emphasis on enrollment choice in higher learning 149 Education reform is also a part of the UK governments Industrial Strategy a plan announcing the nations intent to invest millions into a technical education system 150 The proposal includes the establishment of a retraining program for workers who wish to adapt their skillsets These suggestions combat the concerns over automation through policy choices aiming to meet the emerging needs of society via updated information Of the professionals within the academic community who applaud such moves often noted is a gap between economic security and formal education 151 a disparity exacerbated by the rising demand for specialized skillsand educations potential to reduce it However several academics have also argued that improved education alone will not be sufficient to solve technological unemployment pointing to recent declines in the demand for many intermediate skills and suggesting that not everyone is capable in becoming proficient in the most advanced skills 29 30 31 Kim Taipale has said that The era of bell curve distributions that supported a bulging social middle class is over Education per se is not going to make up the difference 152 while an oped piece from 2011 Paul Krugman an economics professor and columnist for the New York Times argued that better education would be an insufficient solution to technological unemployment as it actually reduces the demand for highly educated workers 153 Living with technological unemployment edit Welfare payments edit The use of various forms of subsidies has often been accepted as a solution to technological unemployment even by conservatives and by those who are optimistic about the long term effect on jobs Welfare programmes have historically tended to be more durable once established compared with other solutions to unemployment such as directly creating jobs with public works Despite being the first person to create a formal system describing compensation effects Ramsey McCulloch and most other classical economists advocated government aid for those suffering from technological unemployment as they understood that market adjustment to new technology was not instantaneous and that those displaced by laboursaving technology would not always be able to immediately obtain alternative employment through their own efforts 20 Basic income edit Main articles Basic income and Guaranteed minimum income Several commentators have argued that traditional forms of welfare payment may be inadequate as a response to the future challenges posed by technological unemployment and have suggested a basic income as an alternative 154 People advocating some form of basic income as a solution to technological unemployment include Martin Ford 155 Erik Brynjolfsson 92 Robert Reich Andrew Yang Elon Musk Zoltan Istvan and Guy Standing Reich has gone as far as to say the introduction of a basic income perhaps implemented as a negative income tax is almost inevitable 156 while Standing has said he considers that a basic income is becoming politically essential 157 Since late 2015 new basic income pilots have been announced in Finland the Netherlands and Canada Further recent advocacy for basic income has arisen from a number of technology entrepreneurs the most prominent being Sam Altman president of Y Combinator 158 Skepticism about basic income includes both right and left elements and proposals for different forms of it have come from all segments of the spectrum For example while the bestknown proposed forms with taxation and distribution are usually thought of as leftleaning ideas that rightleaning people try to defend against other forms have been proposed even by libertarians such as von Hayek and Friedman Republican president Nixon s Family Assistance Plan FAP of 1969 which had much in common with basic income passed in the House but was defeated in the Senate 159 One objection to basic income is that it could be a disincentive to work but evidence from older pilots in India Africa and Canada indicates that this does not happen and that a basic income encourages lowlevel entrepreneurship and more productive collaborative work Another objection is that funding it sustainably is a huge challenge While new revenueraising ideas have been proposed such as Martin Fords wage recapture tax how to fund a generous basic income remains a debated question and skeptics have dismissed it as utopian Even from a progressive viewpoint there are concerns that a basic income set too low may not help the economically vulnerable especially if financed largely from cuts to other forms of welfare 157 160 161 162 To better address both the funding concerns and concerns about government control one alternative model is that the cost and control would be distributed across the private sector instead of the public sector Companies across the economy would be required to employ humans but the job descriptions would be left to private innovation and individuals would have to compete to be hired and retained This would be a forprofit sector analog of basic income that is a marketbased form of basic income It differs from a job guarantee in that the government is not the employer rather companies are and there is no aspect of having employees who cannot be fired a problem that interferes with economic dynamism The economic salvation in this model is not that every individual is guaranteed a job but rather just that enough jobs exist that massive unemployment is avoided and employment is no longer solely the privilege of only the very smartest or highly trained 20 of the population Another option for a marketbased form of basic income has been proposed by the Center for Economic and Social Justice CESJ as part of a Just Third Way a Third Way with greater justice through widely distributed power and liberty Called the Capital Homestead Act 163 it is reminiscent of James S Albus s Peoples Capitalism 71 72 in that money creation and securities ownership are widely and directly distributed to individuals rather than flowing through or being concentrated in centralized or elite mechanisms Broadening the ownership of technological assets edit Several solutions have been proposed which do not fall easily into the traditional leftright political spectrum This includes broadening the ownership of robots and other productive capital assets Enlarging the ownership of technologies has been advocated by people including James S Albus 71 164 John Lanchester 165 Richard B Freeman 161 and Noah Smith 166 Jaron Lanier has proposed a somewhat similar solution a mechanism where ordinary people receive nano payments for the big data they generate by their regular surfing and other aspects of their online presence 167 Structural changes towards a postscarcity economy edit Main article Postscarcity economy The Zeitgeist Movement TZM The Venus Project TVP as well as various individuals and organizations propose structural changes towards a form of a postscarcity economy in which people are freed from their automatable monotonous jobs instead of losing their jobs In the system proposed by TZM all jobs are either automated abolished for bringing no true value for society such as ordinary advertising rationalized by more efficient sustainable and open processes and collaboration or carried out based on altruism and social relevance see also Whuffie opposed to compulsion or monetary gain 168 169 170 171 172 The movement also speculates that the free time made available to people will permit a renaissance of creativity invention community and social capital as well as reducing stress 168 Other approaches edit The threat of technological unemployment has occasionally been used by free market economists as a justification for supply side reforms to make it easier for employers to hire and fire workers Conversely it has also been used as a reason to justify an increase in employee protection 15 173 Economists including Larry Summers have advised a package of measures may be needed He advised vigorous cooperative efforts to address the myriad devices such as tax havens bank secrecy money laundering and regulatory arbitrage which enable the holders of great wealth to avoid paying taxes and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring great social contributions in return Summers suggested more vigorous enforcement of antimonopoly laws reductions in excessive protection for intellectual property greater encouragement of profitsharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements improvements in corporate governance strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity easing of landuse restrictions that may cause estates to keep rising in value better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development such as energy production and transportation 11 98 99 174 Michael Spence has advised that responding to the future impact of technology will require a detailed understanding of the global forces and flows technology has set in motion Adapting to them will require shifts in mindsets policies investments especially in human capital and quite possibly models of employment and distribution note 6 175 See also edit Autonomous car Disruptive innovation Emerging technologies Futures studies Humans Need Not Apply Industrial society Player Piano Robot tax Technological revolution Technological transitions Technophobia The Future of Work and Death The Triple Revolution Working time Notes edit Labourdisplacing technologies can be classified under the headings of mechanization automation and process improvement The first two fundamentally involve transferring tasks from humans to machines The third often involves the elimination of tasks altogether The common theme of all three is that tasks are removed from the workforce decreasing employment In practice the categories often overlap a process improvement can include an automating or mechanizing achievement The line between mechanization and automation is also subjective as sometimes mechanization can involve sufficient control to be viewed as part of automation Smith did not directly address the problem of technological unemployment but the Dean had saying in 1757 that in the long term the introduction of machinery would allow more employment than would have been possible without them Typically the introduction of machinery would both increase output and lower cost per unit In the 1930s this study was Unemployment and technological change Report no G70 1940 by Corrington Calhoun Gill of the National Research Project on Reemployment Opportunities and Recent changes in Industrial Techniques Some earlier Federal reports took a pessimistic view of technological unemployment eg Memorandum on Technological Unemployment 1933 by Ewan Clague Bureau of Labor Statistics Some authorities eg Udo Sautter in Chpt 5 of Three Cheers for the Unemployed Government and Unemployment Before the New Deal Cambridge University Press 1991 say that in the early 1930s there was near consensus among US experts that technological unemployment was a major problem Others though like Bruce Bartlett in Is Industrial Innovation Destroying Jobs Cato Journal 1984 argue that most economists remained optimistic even during the 1930s In the 1960s episode the major Federal study that bookmarked the end of the period of intense debate was Technology and the American economy 1966 by the National Commission on Technology Automation and Economic Progress established by president Lyndon Jonhson in 1964 Other recent statements by Summers include warnings on the devastating consequences for those who perform routine tasks arising from robots 3D printing artificial intelligence and similar technologies In his view already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing And the trends are all in the wrong direction particularly for the less skilled as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace whitecollar as well as bluecollar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead Summers has also said that There are many reasons to think the software revolution will be even more profound than the agricultural revolution This time around change will come faster and affect a much larger share of the economy There are more sectors losing jobs than creating jobs And the generalpurpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever If current trends continue it could well be that a generation from now a quarter of middleaged men will be out of work at any given moment Spence also wrote that Now comes a powerful wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks This process of labor substitution and disintermediation has been underway for some time in service sectors think of ATMs online banking enterprise resource planning customer relationship management mobile payment systems and much more This revolution is spreading to the production of goods where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor In his view the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start in the design of hardware eg sensors and more important in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks Once this is achieved the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low and declines as scale rises and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing the incentives to invest in digital technologies are compelling Spence believes that unlike prior digital technologies which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies is cost reduction via the replacement of labor For example as the cost of 3D printing technology declines it is easy to imagine that production may become extremely local and customized Moreover production may occur in response to actual demand not anticipated or forecast demand Meanwhile the impact of robotics is not confined to production Though selfdriving cars and drones are the most attentiongetting examples the impact on logistics is no less transformative Computers and robotic cranes that schedule and move containers around and load ships now control the Port of Singapore one of the most efficient in the world Spence believes that labor no matter how inexpensive will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion with laborintensive processoriented manufacturing becoming less effective and that relocalization will appear globally In his view production will not disappear but it will be less laborintensive and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth
