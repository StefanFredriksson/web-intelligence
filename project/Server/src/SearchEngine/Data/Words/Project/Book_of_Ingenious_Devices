Book of Ingenious Devices Drawing of Self trimming lamp in Ahmad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir s treatise on mechanical devices The manuscript was written in Arabic The Book of Ingenious Devices Arabic كتاب الحيل Kitab alHiyal Persian كتاب ترفندها Ketab tarfandha literally The Book of Tricks was a large illustrated work on mechanical devices including automata published in 850 by the three brothers of Persian 1 descent known as the Banu Musa Ahmad Muhammad and Hasan bin Musa ibn Shakir working at the House of Wisdom Bayt alHikma in Baghdad Iraq under the Abbasid Caliphate 2 The book described about one hundred devices and how to use them 3 Contents 1 Overview 2 Mechanisms and components 21 Automatic controls 22 Automatic crank 23 Valves 24 Other mechanisms 3 Machines and devices 31 Automatic fountains 32 Mechanical musical machines 33 Practical tools 34 Water dispensers 35 Other devices 4 See also 5 Notes 6 References and further reading 7 External links Overview edit The book was commissioned by the Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad also made by AlJazari Abu Jafar alMamun ibn Harun 786833 who instructed the Banu Musa to acquire all of the Hellenistic texts that had been preserved by monasteries specify and by scholars who during the decline and fall of Roman civilization 4 clarification needed The Banū Mūsā brothers invented a number of automata automatic machines and mechanical devices and they described a hundred such devices in their Book of Ingenious Devices 3 Some of the devices described in the Book of Ingenious Devices were inspired by the works of Hero of Alexandria 5 and Philo of Byzantium as well as ancient Persian Chinese and Indian engineering 6 Many of the other devices described in the book however were original inventions by the Banu Musa brothers 7 While they took Greek works as a starting point the Banu Musa went well beyond anything achieved by Hero or Philo Their preoccupation with automatic controls distinguishes them from their Greek predecessors including the Banu Musas use of selfoperating valves timing devices delay systems and other concepts of great ingenuity 8 Many of their innovations involved subtle combinations of pneumatics and aerostatics 8 The closest modern parallel to their work lies in control engineering and pneumatic instrumentation 9 In turn the Banu Musas work was later cited as an influence on the work of AlJazari who produced a similarly titled book in 1206 10 Given that the Book of Ingenious Devices was widely circulated across the Muslim world some of its ideas may have also reached Europe through Islamic Spain such as the use of automatic controls in later European machines or the use of conical valves in the work of Leonardo da Vinci 9 Mechanisms and components edit Automatic controls edit The Banu Musa brothers described a number of early automatic controls 11 Twostep level controls for fluids an early form of discontinuous variable structure controls was developed by the Banu Musa brothers 12 They also described an early feedback controller 13 pageneeded Donald Routledge Hill wrote the following on the automatic controls underlying the mechanical trick devices described in the book

different effects For example a single outlet pipe in a vessel might pour out first wine then water and finally a mixture of the two Although it cannot be claimed that the results are important the means by which they were obtained are of great significance for the history of engineering The Banu Musa were masters in the exploitation of small variations in aerostatic and hydrostatic pressures and in using conical valves as inline components in flow systems the first known use of conical valves as automatic controllers 14 The Banu Musa also developed an early failsafe system for use in their trick devices as described by Hill In several of these vessels one can withdraw small quantities of liquid repeatedly but if one withdraws a large quantity no further extractions are possible In modern terms one would call the method used to achieve this result a failsafe system 14 Automatic crank edit The nonmanual crank appears in several of the hydraulic devices described by the Banū Mūsā brothers in their Book of Ingenious Devices 15 These automatically operated cranks appear in several devices two of which contain an action which approximates to that of a crankshaft anticipating AlJazari s invention by several centuries and its first appearance in Europe by over five centuries However the automatic crank described by the Banu Musa would not have allowed a full rotation but only a small modification was required to convert it to a crankshaft 16 Valves edit A mechanism developed by the Banu Musa of particular importance for future developments was the conical valve which was used in a variety of different applications 8 This includes using conical valves as inline components in flow systems which was the first known use of conical valves as automatic controllers 14 Some of the other valves they described include Plug valve 13 14 Float valve 13 Tap 17 Other mechanisms edit The doubleconcentric siphon and the funnel with bent end for pouring in different liquids neither of which appear in any earlier Greek works were also original inventions by the Banu Musa brothers 6 Some of the other mechanisms they described include a float chamber 11 and an early differential pressure sensor 18 Machines and devices edit Automatic fountains edit The book describes the construction of various automatic fountains an aspect that was largely neglected in earlier Greek treatises on technology 6 In one of these fountains the water issues from the fountainhead in the shape of a shield or like a lilyofthevalley ie the shapes are discharged alternatelyeither a sheet of water concave downwards or a spray Another fountain discharges a shield or a single jet while a variation of this features doubleaction alternation ie has two fountainheads with one discharging a single jet and the other a shield and the two alternating repeatedly Another variation features one main fountainhead and two or more subsidiary ones such that when the main one ejects a single jet the subsidiaries eject shields with the two alternating 3 The Banu Musa brothers also described the earliest known windpowered fountain 19 which is described as operated by wind or water it discharges a single jet or a lilyofthevalley A variation of this fountain incorporates a worm and pinion gear while another variation features doubleaction alternation The book also describes a fountain with variable discharge 3 The book also describes fountains that change shapes at intervals 14 Mechanical musical machines edit The Banu Musa invented an early mechanical musical instrument in this case a hydropowered organ which played interchangeable cylinders automatically According to Charles B Fowler this cylinder with raised pins on the surface remained the basic device to produce and reproduce music mechanically until the second half of the nineteenth century 20 The Banu Musa also invented an automatic flute player which may have been the first programmable machine 21 The flute sounds were produced through hot steam and the user could adjust the device to various patterns so that they could get various sounds from it 22 Practical tools edit The mechanical grab 6 specifically the clamshell grab 14 is an original invention by the Banu Musa brothers that does not appear in any earlier Greek works 6 The grab they described was used to extract objects from underwater 3 and recover objects from the beds of streams 14 The Banu Musa also invented an early gas mask 14 for protecting workers in polluted wells 23 They also described bellows that could remove foul air from wells 3 They explained that these instruments allow a worker to descend into any well he wishes for a while and he will not fear it nor will it harm him if God wills may he be exalted 24 Water dispensers edit The book describes a dispenser for hot and cold water where the two outlets alternate one discharging cold water and the other hot then vice versa repeatedly It also describes a vessel with a basin by its side where when cold water is poured into the top of the vessel it discharges from the mouth of a figure into the basin when hot water or another liquid is poured into the basin the same quantity of cold water is discharged from the mouth of the figure 3 The book also describes a boiler with a tap to access hot water The water is heated through cold water being poured into a pipe which leads to a tank at the bottom of the boiler where the water is heated with fire A person can then access hot water from the boiler through a tap 17 Other devices edit Some of the other devices the Banu Musa described in their book include Mechanical trick devices 14 Hurricane lamp 14 Selftrimming lamp 14 by Ahmad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir Selffeeding lamp 14 See also edit Banū Mūsā
