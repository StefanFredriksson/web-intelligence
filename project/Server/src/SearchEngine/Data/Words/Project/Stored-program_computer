Storedprogram computer See also Universal Turing machine Storedprogram computer A storedprogram computer is a computer that stores program instructions in electronic memory 1 This contrasts with machines where the program instructions are stored on plugboards or similar mechanisms Often the definition is extended with the requirement that the treatment of programs and data in memory be interchangeable or uniform 2 3 4 Contents 1 Description 2 History 21 The first storedprogram computer 3 See also 4 References Description edit A computer with a von Neumann architecture stores program data and instruction data in the same memory a computer with a Harvard architecture has separate memories for storing program and data 5 6 Both are storedprogram designs Storedprogram computer is sometimes used as a synonym for von Neumann architecture 7 8 however Professor Jack Copeland considers that it is historically inappropriate to refer to electronic storedprogram digital computers as von Neumann machines 9 Hennessy and Patterson write that the early Harvard machines were regarded as reactionary by the advocates of storedprogram computers 10 History edit The storedprogram computer idea can be traced back to the 1936 theoretical concept of a universal Turing machine 11 Von Neumann was aware of this paper and he impressed it on his collaborators as well 12 Many early computers such as the AtanasoffBerry computer were not reprogrammable They executed a single hardwired program As there were no program instructions no program storage was necessary Other computers though programmable stored their programs on punched tape which was physically fed into the machine as needed In 1936 Konrad Zuse anticipated in two patent applications that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data 13 14 The University of Manchester s Baby 15 is generally recognized as worlds first electronic computer that ran a stored programan event that occurred on 21 June 1948 16 17 However the Baby was not regarded as a fullfledged computer but more a proof of concept predecessor to the Manchester Mark 1 computer which was first put to research work in April 1949 On 6 May 1949 the EDSAC in Cambridge ran its first program making it another electronic digital storedprogram computer 18 It is sometimes claimed that the IBM SSEC operational in January 1948 was the first storedprogram computer 19 this claim is controversial not least because of the hierarchical memory system of the SSEC and because some aspects of its operations like access to relays or tape drives were determined by plugging 20 The first storedprogram computer to be built in continental Europe was the MESM completed in the Soviet Union in 1951 21 The first storedprogram computer edit Several computers could be considered the first storedprogram computer depending on the criteria 22 IBM SSEC became operational in January 1948 but was electromechanical 23 In April 1948 modifications were completed to ENIAC initially completed in 1945 to function as a storedprogram computer with the program in its function tables by setting dials on its function tables which could store 3600 decimal digits for instructions 24 25 ARC2 a relay machine developed by Andrew Booth and Kathleen Booth at Birkbeck University of London officially came online on May 12 1948 26 It featured the first rotating drum storage device 27 28 Manchester Baby a developmental fully electronic computer that successfully ran a stored program on June 21 1948 It was subsequently developed into the Manchester Mark 1 which ran its first program in early April 1949 Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator EDSAC which ran its first programs on May 6 1949 and became a fullscale operational computer EDVAC conceived in June 1945 in First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC but not delivered until August 1949 BINAC delivered to a customer on August 22 1949 It worked at the factory but there is disagreement about whether or not it worked satisfactorily after being delivered If it had been finished at the projected time it would have been the first storedprogram computer in the world It was the first storedprogram computer in the US 29 ETL Mark III which began development in 1954 30 and was completed in 1956 was the first storedprogram transistor computer It was created by Japans Electrotechnical Laboratory 31 32 33 See also edit Stored program control References edit Allison Joanne 1997 Storedprogram Computers archived from the original on 27 September 2011 retrieved 24 August 2011
