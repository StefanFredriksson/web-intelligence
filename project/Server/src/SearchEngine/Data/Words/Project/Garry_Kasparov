30 and breaking the record held by Mikhail Tal for over 20 years 31 Kasparovs win as Black in the 16th game has been recognized as one of the alltime masterpieces in chess history As part of the arrangements following the aborted 1984 match Karpov had been granted in the event of his defeat a right to rematch Another match took place in 1986 hosted jointly in London and Leningrad with each city hosting 12 games At one point in the match Kasparov opened a threepoint lead and looked well on his way to a decisive match victory But Karpov fought back by winning three consecutive games to

Seville as Karpov had qualified through the Candidates Matches to again become the official challenger This match was very close with neither player holding more than a onepoint lead at any time during the contest Kasparov was down one full point at the time of the final game and needed a win to draw the match and retain his title A long tense game ensued in which Karpov blundered away a pawn just before the first time control and Kasparov eventually won a long ending Kasparov retained his title as the match was drawn by a score of 1212 All this meant that Kasparov had played Karpov four times in the period 198487 a statistic unprecedented in chess Matches organized by FIDE had taken place every three years since 1948 and only Botvinnik had a right to a rematch before Karpov A fifth

players and give them more say in FIDEs activities Kasparov assumed a leadership role GMAs major achievement was in organizing a series of six World Cup tournaments for the worlds top players A somewhat uneasy relationship developed with FIDE and a sort of truce was brokered by Bessel Kok a Dutch businessman This standoff lasted until 1993 by which time a new challenger had qualified through the Candidates cycle for Kasparovs next World Championship defense Nigel Short a British grandmaster who had defeated Anatoly Karpov in a qualifying match and then Jan Timman in the finals held in early 1993 After a confusing and compressed bidding process produced lower financial estimates than expected 32 the world champion and his challenger decided to play outside FIDEs jurisdiction under another organization created by Kasparov called the Professional Chess Association PCA At this point a great fracture occurred in the lineage of the FIDE World Championship In an interview in 2007 Kasparov called the break with FIDE the worst mistake of his career as it hurt the game in the long run 33 Kasparov and Short were ejected from FIDE and played their wellsponsored match in London in 1993 Kasparov won convincingly by a score of 127 The match considerably raised the profile of chess in the UK with an unprecedented level of coverage on Channel 4 Meanwhile FIDE organized a World Championship match between Jan Timman the defeated Candidates finalist and former World Champion Karpov a defeated Candidates semifinalist which Karpov won Kasparov and Sting in 2000 FIDE removed

Shirov and Vladimir Kramnik played a candidates match to decide the challenger which Shirov won in a surprising upset But when Rentero admitted that the funds required and promised had never materialized the WCA collapsed This left Kasparov stranded and yet another organization stepped in BrainGamescom headed by Raymond Keene No match against Shirov was arranged and talks with Anand

leave again given Putins ongoing crackdown against dissenters So for the time being he said I refrain from returning to Russia He explained shortly thereafter in an article for The Daily Beast that this had not been intended as a declaration of leaving my home country permanently or otherwise but merely an expression of the dark reality of the situation in Russia today where nearly half the members of the oppositions Coordinating Council are under criminal investigation on concocted charges He noted that the Moscow prosecutors office was opening an investigation that would limit my ability to travel making it impossible for him to fulfill professional speaking engagements and hindering his work for the nonprofit Kasparov Chess Foundation which has centers in New York City Brussels and Johannesburg to promote chess in education 103 Kasparov further wrote in his June 2013 Daily Beast article that the mass protests in Moscow 18 months earlier against fraudulent Russian elections had been a proud moment for me He recalled that after joining the opposition movement in March 2005 he had been criticized for seeking to unite every antiPutin element in the country to march together regardless of ideology Therefore the sight of hundreds of flags representing every group from liberals to nationalists all marching together for Russia Without Putin was the fulfillment of a dream Yet most Russians he lamented had continued to slumber even as Putin had taken off the flimsy mask of democracy to reveal himself in full as the wouldbe KGB dictator he has always been 104 Kasparov responded with several sardonic Twitter postings to a September 2013 The New York Times oped by Putin I hope Putin has taken adequate protections he tweeted Now that he is a Russian journalist his life may be in grave danger Also Now we can expect NY Times opeds by Mugabe on fair elections Castro on free speech Kim Jongun on prison reform The Axis of Hypocrisy 105 In a 12 May 2013 oped for The Wall Street Journal Kasparov questioned reports that the Russian security agency the FSB had fully cooperated with the FBI in the matter of the Boston bombers He noted that the elder bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev had reportedly met in Russia with two known jihadists who were killed in Dagestan by the Russian military just days before Tamerlan left Russia for the US Kasparov argued If no intelligence was sent from Moscow to Washington about this meeting all this talk of FSB cooperation cannot be taken seriously He further observed This would not be the first time Russian security forces seemed strangely impotent in the face of an impending terror attack pointing out that in both the 2002 Moscow theater siege and the 2004 Beslan school attack there were FSB informants in both terror groupsyet the attacks went ahead unimpeded Given this history he wrote it is impossible to overlook that the Boston bombing took place just days after the US Magnitsky List was published creating the first serious external threat to the Putin power structure by penalizing Russian officials complicit in humanrights crimes In sum Putins dubious record on counterterrorism and its continued support of terror sponsors Iran and Syria mean only one thing common ground zero 106 Kasparov wrote in July 2013 about the trial in Kirov of fellow opposition leader Alexei Navalny who had been convicted on concocted embezzlement charges only to see the prosecutor surprisingly ask for his release the next day pending appeal The judicial process and the democratic process in Russia wrote Kasparov are both elaborate mockeries created to distract the citizenry at home and to help Western leaders avoid confronting the awkward fact that Russia has returned to a police state Still Kasparov felt that whatever had caused the Kirov prosecutors aboutface my optimism tells me it was a positive sign After more than 13 years of predictable repression under Putin anything different is good 107 Kasparov maintains a summer home in the Croatian city of Makarska In early February 2014 Kasparov applied for citizenship by naturalisation in Croatia adding that he was finding it increasingly difficult to live in Russia According to an article in The Guardian Kasparov is widely perceived as having been a vocal supporter of Croatian independence during the early 1990s On 28 February 2014 his application for naturalisation was approved and he is now a Croatian passport holder 108 Views edit Kasparov wrote in Time on 18 September 2013 that he considered the chess metaphors thrown around during the worlds response to the civil war in Syria to be trite and rejected what he called all the nonsense about Putin is playing chess and Obama is playing checkers or tictactoe or whatever Putin argued Kasparov did not have to outplay or outthink anyone He and Bashar Assad won by forfeit when President Obama Prime Minister Cameron and the rest of the socalled leaders of the free world walked away from the table There is he lamented a new game at the negotiating table where Putin and Assad set the rules and will run the show under the protection of the UN 109 Kasparov said in September 2013 that Russia was now a dictatorship 110 In the same month he told an interviewer that Obama going to Russia now is dead wrong morally and politically because Putins regime is behind Assad 111 Kasparov spoke out several times about Putins antigay laws and the proposed Sochi Olympics boycott He explained in August 2013 that he had opposed Russias bid from the outset since hosting the Olympics would allow Vladimir Putins cronies to embezzle hundreds of millions of dollars and lend prestige to Putins authoritarian regime Kasparov added that Putins antigay law was only the most recent encroachment on the freedom of speech and association of Russias citizens which the international community had largely ignored Instead of supporting a games boycott which would unfairly punish athletes Kasparov called for athletes and others to transform Putins selfcongratulatory pet project into a spotlight that exposes his authoritarian rule for the entire world to see 112 In September Kasparov expanded on his remarks saying that forcing athletes to play a political role against their will is not fair and that politicians should not hide behind athletes Instead of boycotting Sochi he suggested politicians should refuse to attend the games and the public should put pressure on the sponsors and the media CocaCola for example could put a rainbow flag on each CocaCola can and NBC could do interviews with Russian gay activists or with Russian political activists Kasparov also emphasized that although he was still a Russian citizen he had good reason to be concerned about my ability to leave Russia if I returned to Moscow 113 Kasparov has spoken out against the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and has stated that control of Crimea should be returned to Ukraine after the overthrow of Vladimir Putin without additional conditions 114 Kasparovs website was blocked by the Russian federative regulator Roskomnadzor at the behest of the public prosecutor allegedly due to Kasparovs opinions of the Crimean crisis Kasparovs block was made in unison with several other notable Russian sites that were accused of inciting public outrage Reportedly several of the blocked sites received an affidavit noting their violations However Kasparov stated that his site had received no such notice of violations after its block 115 In 2015 a whole note on Kasparov was removed from a Russian language encyclopedia of greatest Soviet players after an intervention from senior leadership 116 In October 2015 Kasparov published a book titled Winter Is Coming Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped In the book Kasparov likens Putin to Hitler and explains the need for the west to oppose Putin sooner rather than appeasing him and postponing the eventual confrontation According to his publisher Kasparov wants this book out fast in a way that has potential to influence the discussion during the primary season 117 118 In the 2016 United States presidential election Kasparov described Republican frontrunner Donald Trump as a celebrity showman with racist leanings and authoritarian tendencies 119 and criticised Trump for calling for closer ties with Vladimir Putin 120 and responded to Trumps running mate Mike Pence calling Putin a strong leader that Putin is a strong leader in the same way arsenic is a strong drink 121 He also criticised the economic policies of Democratic primary candidate Bernie Sanders but showed respect for Sanders as a charismatic speaker and a passionate believer in his cause 122 In 2017 he condemned the violence unleashed by the Spanish police against the independence referendum in Catalonia on October 1 He criticized the Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy and accused him of betraying the European promise of peace 123 Also after the Catalan regional election held the same year on December 21 he called on the European Union to intervene in the conflict to find a negotiated solution He wrote on Twitter Despite unprecedented pressure from Madrid Catalonian separatists won a majority Europe must speak and help find a peaceful path toward resolution and avoid more violence 124 125 Human Rights Foundation edit Kasparov was named Chairman of the Human Rights Foundation in 2011 succeeding the recently deceased author activist and former Czech president Václav Havel 126 On 31 January 2012 Kasparov hosted a meeting of opposition leaders planning a mass march on 4 February 2012 the third major opposition rally held since the disputed State Duma elections of December 2011 Among other opposition leaders attending were Alexey Navalny and Yevgenia Chirikova 127 Playing style edit Kasparovs style of play has been compared by many to Alekhines 128 129 Kasparov has described his style as being influenced chiefly by Alekhine Tal and Fischer 130 Kramnik has opined that Kasparovs capacity for study is second to none and said There is nothing in chess he has been unable to deal with 131 Magnus Carlsen whom Kasparov coached from 2009 to 2010 said of Kasparov Ive never seen someone with such a feel for dynamics in complex positions 132 Kasparov was known for his extensive opening preparation and aggressive play in the opening 133 134 Olympiads and other major team events edit Kasparov at Valletta in 1980 Kasparov played in a total of eight Chess Olympiads He represented the Soviet Union four times and Russia four times following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 In his 1980 Olympiad debut he became at age 17 the youngest player to represent the Soviet Union or Russia at that level a record which was broken by Vladimir Kramnik in 1992 In 82 games he has scored 50329 for 787 and won a total of 19 medals including team gold medals all eight times he competed For the 1994 Moscow Olympiad he had a significant organizational role in helping to put together the event on short notice after Thessaloniki canceled its offer to host a few weeks before the

910 802 team gold Records and achievements edit Chess ratings achievements edit Kasparov holds the record for the longest time as the No 1 rated player in the world from 1986 to 2005 Vladimir Kramnik shared the No 1 ranking with him once in the January 1996 FIDE rating list 137 He was also briefly ejected from the list following his split from FIDE in 1993 but during that time he headed the rating list of the rival PCA At the time of his retirement he was still ranked No 1 in the world with a rating of 2812 His rating has fallen inactive since the January 2006 rating list 138 In January 1990 Kasparov achieved the then highest FIDE rating ever passing 2800 and breaking Bobby Fischers old record of 2785 By the July 1999 and January 2000 FIDE rating lists Kasparov had reached a 2851 Elo rating at that time the highest rating ever achieved 139 He held that record for the highest rating ever achieved until Magnus Carlsen attained a new record high rating of 2861 in January 2013 Other records edit Kasparov holds the record for most consecutive professional tournament victories placing first or equal first in 15 individual tournaments from 1981 to 1990 citation needed The streak was

Investbank 1989 911 1st Linares 1990 811 1st Kasparov won the Chess Oscar a record eleven times Chess and computers edit In 1983 Acorn Computers acted as one of the sponsors for Kasparovs Candidates semifinal match against Viktor Korchnoi Kasparov was awarded a BBC Micro which he took back with him to Baku making it perhaps the first westernmade microcomputer to reach Baku at that time 140 In 1985 computer chess magazine editor Frederic Friedel invited Kasparov to his house and the two of them discussed how a chess database program would be useful for preparation Two years later Friedel founded Chessbase and gave a copy of the program to Kasparov who started using it in his preparation 141 In 1985 Kasparov played against thirtytwo different chess computers in Hamburg winning all games but with some difficulty 142 On October 22 1989 Kasparov defeated the chess computer Deep Thought in both games of a twogame match 143 In December 1992 Kasparov visited Frederic Friedel in his hotel room in Cologne and played 37 blitz games against Fritz 2 winning 24 drawing 4 and losing 9 144 Kasparov cooperated in producing video material for the computer game Kasparovs Gambit released by Electronic Arts in November 1993 In April 1994 Intel acted as a sponsor for the first Professional Chess Association Grand Prix event in Moscow played a time control of 25 minutes per game In May Chessbase s Fritz 3 running on an Intel Pentium PC defeated Kasparov in their first in the Intel Express blitz tournament in Munich but Kasparov managed to tie it for first and then win the playoff with 3 wins and 2 draws The next day Kasparov lost to Fritz 3 again in a game on ZDF TV 145 In August Kasparov was knocked out of the London Intel Grand Prix by Richard Langs ChessGenius 2 program in the first round In 1995 during Kasparovs world title match with Viswanathan Anand he unveiled an opening novelty that had been checked with a chess engine an approach that would become increasingly common in subsequent years 146 Kasparov played in a pair of sixgame chess matches with an IBM supercomputer called Deep Blue The first match was played in Philadelphia in 1996 and won by Kasparov The second was played in New York City in 1997 and won by Deep Blue The 1997 match was the first defeat of a reigning world chess champion by a computer under tournament conditions 147 In May 1997 an updated version of Deep Blue defeated Kasparov 32 in a highly publicized sixgame match The match was even after five games but Kasparov lost quickly in Game 6 This was the first time a computer had ever defeated a world champion in a match A documentary film was made about this famous match entitled Game Over Kasparov and the Machine Kasparov said that he was not well prepared to face Deep Blue in 1997 He said that based on his objective strengths his play was stronger than that of Deep Blue 147 Kasparov claimed that several factors weighed against him in this match In particular he was denied access to Deep Blues recent games in contrast to the computers team which could study hundreds of Kasparovs After the loss Kasparov said that he sometimes saw deep intelligence and creativity in the machines moves suggesting that during the second game human chess players in contravention of the rules intervened IBM denied that it cheated saying the only human intervention occurred between games The rules provided for the developers to modify the program between games an opportunity they said they used to shore up weaknesses in the computers play revealed during the course of the match Kasparov requested printouts of the machines log files but IBM refused although the company later published the logs on the Internet 148 Much later it was suggested that the behavior Kasparov noted may have resulted from a glitch in the computer program 149 Although Kasparov wanted another rematch IBM declined and ended their Deep Blue program Kasparovs loss to Deep Blue inspired the creation of the game Arimaa 150 Kasparov wore 3D glasses in his match against the program X3D Fritz In January 2003 he engaged in a sixgame classical time control match with a 1million prize fund which was billed as the FIDE Man vs Machine World Championship against Deep Junior 151 The engine evaluated three million positions per second 152 After one win each and three draws it was all up to the final game After reaching a decent position Kasparov offered a draw which was soon accepted by the Deep Junior team Asked why he offered the draw Kasparov said he feared making a blunder 153 Originally planned as an annual event the match was not repeated Deep Junior was the first machine to beat Kasparov with black and at a standard time control 154 In June 2003 Mindscape released the computer game Kasparov Chessmate with Kasparov himself listed as a codesigner 155 In November 2003 he engaged in a fourgame match against the computer program X3D Fritz using a virtual board 3D glasses and a speech recognition system After two draws and one win apiece the X3D ManMachine match ended in a draw Kasparov received 175000 for the result and took home the golden trophy Kasparov continued to criticize the blunder in the second game that cost him a crucial point He felt that he had outplayed the machine overall and played well I only made one mistake but unfortunately that one mistake lost the game

Great Predecessors series edit Main article My Great Predecessors In 2003 the first volume of his fivevolume work Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors was published This volume which deals with the world chess champions Wilhelm Steinitz Emanuel Lasker José Raúl Capablanca Alexander Alekhine and some of their strong contemporaries has received lavish praise from some reviewers including Nigel Short while attracting criticism from others for historical inaccuracies and analysis of games directly copied from unattributed sources Through suggestions on the books website most of these shortcomings were corrected in following editions and translations Despite this the first volume won the British Chess Federation s Book of the Year award in 2003 Volume two covering Max Euwe Mikhail Botvinnik Vasily Smyslov and Mikhail Tal appeared later in 2003 Volume three covering Tigran Petrosian and Boris Spassky appeared in early 2004 In December 2004 Kasparov released volume four which

Kasparov Kasparov is publishing three volumes of his games Winter Is Coming edit In October 2015 Kasparov published a book titled Winter Is Coming Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped The title is a reference to the HBO television series Game of Thrones In the book Kasparov writes about the need for an organization solely composed of democratic countries to replace the United Nations In an interview he called the United Nations a catwalk for dictators 65 Historical revision edit Kasparov believes that the conventional history of civilization is radically incorrect Specifically he believes that the history of ancient civilizations is based on misdatings of events and achievements that actually occurred in the medieval period 161 162 He has cited several aspects of ancient history that he says are likely to be anachronisms 163 Kasparov has written in support of New Chronology Fomenko although with some reservations 164 In 2001 Kasparov expressed a desire to devote his time to promoting the New Chronology after his chess career New Chronology is a great area for investing my intellect My analytical abilities are well placed to figure out what was right and what was wrong 165 When I stop playing chess it may well be that I concentrate on promoting these ideas I believe they can improve our lives 165 Later Kasparov renounced his support of Fomenko theories but reaffirmed his belief that mainstream historical knowledge is highly inconsistent 166 167 Other postretirement writing edit In 2007 he wrote How Life Imitates Chess an examination of the parallels between decisionmaking in chess and in the business world In 2008 Kasparov published a sympathetic obituary for Bobby Fischer writing I am often asked if I ever met or played Bobby Fischer The answer is no I never had that opportunity But even though he saw me as a member of the evil chess establishment that he felt had robbed and cheated him I am sorry I never had a chance to thank him personally for what he did for our sport 168 He is the chief advisor for the book publisher Everyman Chess Kasparov works closely with Mig Greengard and his comments can often be found on Greengards blog apparently no longer active Kasparov collaborated with Max Levchin and Peter Thiel on The Blueprint a book calling for a revival of world innovation planned to release in March 2013 from W W Norton Company The book was never released as the authors disagreed on its contents 169 Kasparov argued that Chess has become the Drosophila fruit fly of reasoning in an editorial comment on Googles AlphaZero chessplaying system I was pleased to see that AlphaZero had a dynamic open style like my own he wrote in late 2018 170 Bibliography edit Kasparov Teaches Chess 198485
