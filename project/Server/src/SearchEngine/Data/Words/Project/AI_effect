AI effect The AI effect occurs when onlookers discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not real intelligence 1 Author Pamela McCorduck writes Its part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do somethingplay good checkers solve simple but relatively informal problemsthere was a chorus of critics to say thats not thinking 2 AIS researcher Rodney Brooks complains Every time we figure out a piece of it it stops being magical we say Oh thats just a computation 3 Contents 1 The

effect is As soon as AI successfully solves a problem the problem is no longer a part of AI Pamela McCorduck calls it an odd paradox that practical AI successes computational programs that actually achieved intelligent behavior were soon assimilated into whatever application domain they were found to be useful in and became silent partners alongside other problemsolving approaches which left AI researchers to deal only with the failures the tough nuts that couldnt yet be cracked 4 When IBM s chess playing computer Deep Blue succeeded in defeating Garry Kasparov in 1997 people complained that it had only used brute force methods and it wasnt real intelligence 5 Fred Reed writes A problem that proponents of AI regularly face is this When we know how a machine does something intelligent it ceases to be regarded as intelligent If I beat the worlds chess champion Id be regarded as highly bright 6 Douglas Hofstadter expresses the AI effect concisely by quoting Tesler s Theorem AI is whatever hasnt been done yet 7 When problems have not yet been formalised they can still be characterised by a model of computation that includes human computation The computational burden of a problem is split between a computer and a human one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by human This formalisation is referred to as humanassisted Turing machine 8 AI applications become mainstream edit Software and algorithms developed by AI researchers are now integrated into many applications throughout the world without really being called AI Michael Swaine reports AI advances are not trumpeted as artificial intelligence so much these days but are often seen as advances in some other field AI has become more important as it has become less conspicuous Patrick Winston says These days it is hard to find a big system that does not work in part because of ideas developed or matured in the AI world 9 According to Stottler Henke The great practical benefits of AI applications and even the existence of AI in many software products go largely unnoticed by many despite the already widespread use of AI techniques in software This is the AI effect Many marketing people dont use the term artificial intelligence even when their companys products rely on some AI techniques Why not 10 Marvin Minsky writes This paradox resulted from the fact that whenever an AI research project made a useful new discovery that product usually quickly spun off to form a new scientific or commercial specialty with its own distinctive name These changes in name led outsiders to ask Why do we see so little progress in the central field of artificial intelligence 11 Nick Bostrom observes that A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labelled AI anymore 12 Legacy of the AI winter edit Main article AI winter Many AI researchers find that they can procure more funding and sell more software if they avoid the tarnished name of artificial intelligence and instead pretend their work has nothing to do with intelligence at all This was especially true in the early 1990s during the second AI winter Patty Tascarella writes Some believe the word robotics actually carries a stigma that hurts a companys chances at funding 13 Saving a place for humanity at the top of the chain of being edit Michael Kearns suggests that people subconsciously are trying to preserve for themselves some special role in the universe 14 By discounting artificial intelligence people can continue to feel unique and special Kearns argues that the change in perception known as the AI effect can be traced to the mystery being removed from the system In being able to trace the cause of events implies that its a form of automation rather than intelligence A related effect has been noted in the history of animal cognition and in consciousness studies where every time a capacity formerly thought as uniquely human is discovered in animals eg the ability to make tools or passing the mirror test the overall importance of that capacity is deprecated citation needed Herbert A Simon when asked about the lack of AIs press coverage at the time said What made AI different was that the very idea of it arouses a real fear and hostility in some human breasts So you are getting very strong emotional reactions But thats okay Well live with that 15 See also edit ELIZA effect Functionalism philosophy of mind History of artificial intelligence Moravecs paradox
