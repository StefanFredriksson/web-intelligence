simplification of neurons in a brain Here each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another Artificial neural networks ANN or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains 1 Such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples generally without being programmed with taskspecific rules For example in image recognition they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as cat or no cat and using the results to identify cats in other images They do this without any prior knowledge of cats for example that they have fur tails whiskers and catlike faces Instead they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the examples that they process An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain Each connection like the synapses in a biological brain can transmit a signal to other neurons An artificial neuron that receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it In ANN implementations the signal at a connection is a real number and the output of each neuron is computed by some nonlinear function of the sum of its inputs The connections are called edges Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold Typically neurons are aggregated into layers Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs Signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would However over time attention moved to performing specific tasks leading to deviations from biology ANNs have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games medical diagnosis and even in activities that have traditionally been considered as reserved to humans like painting 2 mwparseroutput toclimit2 toclevel1 ulmwparseroutput toclimit3 toclevel2 ulmwparseroutput toclimit4 toclevel3 ulmwparseroutput

article History of artificial neural networks Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts 3 1943 opened the subject by creating a computational model for neural networks 4 In the late 1940s D O Hebb 5 created a learning hypothesis based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that became known as Hebbian learning Farley and Wesley A Clark 6 1954 first used computational machines then called calculators to simulate a Hebbian network Rosenblatt 7 1958 created the perceptron 8 The first functional networks with many layers were published by Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965 as the Group Method of Data Handling 9 10 11 The basics of continuous backpropagation 9 12 13 14 were derived in the context of control theory by Kelley 15 in 1960 and by Bryson in 1961 16 using principles of dynamic programming In 1970 Seppo Linnainmaa published the general method for automatic differentiation AD of discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions 17 18 In 1973 Dreyfus used backpropagation to adapt parameters of controllers in proportion to error gradients 19 Werbos s 1975 backpropagation algorithm enabled practical training of multilayer networks In 1982 he applied Linnainmaas AD method to neural networks in the way that became widely used 12 20 Thereafter research stagnated following Minsky and Papert 1969 21 who discovered that basic perceptrons were incapable of processing the exclusiveor circuit and that computers lacked sufficient power to process useful neural networks In 1992 maxpooling was introduced to help with least shift invariance and tolerance to deformation to aid in 3D object recognition 22 23 24 Schmidhuber adopted a multilevel hierarchy of networks 1992 pretrained one level at a time by unsupervised learning and finetuned by backpropagation 25 Geoffrey Hinton et al 2006 proposed learning a highlevel representation using successive layers of binary or realvalued latent variables with a restricted Boltzmann machine 26 to model each layer In 2012 Ng and Dean created a network that learned to recognize higherlevel concepts such as cats only from watching unlabeled images 27 Unsupervised pretraining and increased computing power from GPUs and distributed computing allowed the use of larger networks particularly in image and visual recognition problems which became known as deep learning citation needed Ciresan and colleagues 2010 28 showed that despite the vanishing gradient problem GPUs make backpropagation feasible for manylayered feedforward neural networks 29 Between 2009 and 2012 ANNs began winning prizes in ANN contests approaching human level performance on various tasks initially in pattern recognition and machine learning 30 31 For example the bidirectional and multidimensional long shortterm memory LSTM 32 33 34 35 of Graves et al won three competitions in connected handwriting recognition in 2009 without any prior knowledge about the three languages to be learned 34 33 Ciresan and colleagues built the first pattern recognizers to achieve humancompetitivesuperhuman performance 36 on benchmarks such as traffic sign recognition IJCNN 2012 Models edit This section may be confusing or unclear to readers Please help us clarify the section There might be a discussion about this on the talk page April 2017 Learn how and when to remove this template message Further information Mathematics of artificial neural networks Neuron and myelinated axon with signal flow from inputs at dendrites to outputs at axon terminals ANNs began as an attempt to exploit the architecture of the human brain to perform tasks that conventional algorithms had little success with They soon reoriented towards improving empirical results mostly abandoning attempts to remain true to their biological precursors Neurons are connected to each other in various patterns to allow the output of some neurons to become the input of others The network forms a directed weighted graph 37 An artificial neural network consists of a collection of simulated neurons Each neuron is a node which is connected to other nodes via links that correspond to biological axonsynapsedendrite connections Each link has a weight which determines the strength of one nodes influence on another 38 Components edit Neurons edit ANNs are composed of artificial neurons which retain the biological concept of neurons which receive input combine the input with their internal state activation and an optional threshold using an activation function and produce output using an output function The initial inputs are external data such as images and documents The ultimate outputs accomplish the task such as recognizing an object in an image The important characteristic of the activation function is that it provides a smooth transition as input values change ie a small change in input produces a small change in output 39 Connections and weights edit The network consists of connections each connection providing the output of one neuron as an input to another neuron Each connection is assigned a weight that represents its relative importance 37 A given neuron can have multiple input and output connections 40 Propagation function edit The propagation function computes the input to a neuron from the outputs of its predecessor neurons and their connections as a weighted sum 37 A bias term can be added to the result of the propagation 41 Organization edit The neurons are typically organized into multiple layers especially in deep learning Neurons of one layer connect only to neurons of the immediately preceding and immediately following layers The layer that receives external data is the input layer The layer that produces the ultimate result is the output layer In between them are zero or more hidden layers Single layer and unlayered networks are also used Between two layers multiple connection patterns are possible They can be fully connected with every neuron in one layer connecting to every neuron in the next layer They can be pooling where a group of neurons in one layer connect to a single neuron in the next layer thereby reducing the number of neurons in that layer 42 Neurons with only such connections form a directed acyclic graph and are known as feedforward networks 43 Alternatively networks that allow connections between neurons in the same or previous layers are known as recurrent networks 44 Hyperparameter edit Main article Hyperparameter machine learning A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins The values of parameters are derived via learning Examples of hyperparameters include learning rate the number of hidden layers and batch size 45 The values of some hyperparameters can be dependent on those of other hyperparameters For example the size of some layers can depend on the overall number of layers Learning edit This section includes a list of references related reading or external links but its sources remain unclear because it

Estimation theory and Machine learning Learning is the adaptation of the network to better handle a task by considering sample observations Learning involves adjusting the weights and optional thresholds of the network to improve the accuracy of the result This is done by minimizing the observed errors Learning is complete when examining additional observations does not usefully reduce the error rate Even after learning the error rate typically does not reach 0 If after learning the error rates too high the network typically must be redesigned Practically this is done by defining a cost function that is evaluated periodically during learning As long as its output continues to decline learning continues The cost is frequently defined as a statistic whose value can only be approximated The outputs are actually numbers so when the error is low the difference between the output almost certainly a cat and the correct answer cat is small Learning attempts to reduce the total of the differences across the observations 37 Most learning models can be viewed as a straightforward application of optimization theory and statistical estimation Learning rate edit The learning rate defines the size of the corrective steps that the model takes to adjust for errors in each observation A high learning rate shortens the training time but with lower ultimate accuracy while a lower learning rate takes longer but with the potential for greater accuracy Optimizations such as Quickprop are primarily aimed at speeding up error minimization while other improvements mainly try to increase reliability In order to avoid oscillation inside the network such as alternating connection weights and to improve the rate of convergence refinements use an adaptive learning rate that increases or decreases as appropriate 46 The concept of momentum allows the balance between the gradient and the previous change to be weighted such that the weight adjustment depends to some degree on the previous change A momentum close to 0 emphasizes the gradient while a value close to 1 emphasizes the last change Cost function edit While it is possible to define a cost function ad hoc frequently the choice is determined by the functions desirable properties such as convexity or because it arises from the model eg in a probabilistic model the models posterior probability can be used as an inverse cost Backpropagation edit Main article Backpropagation Backpropagation is a method to adjust the connection weights to compensate for each error found during learning The error amount is effectively divided among the connections Technically backprop calculates the gradient the derivative of the cost function associated with a given state with respect to the weights The weight updates can be done via stochastic gradient descent or other methods such as Extreme Learning Machines 47 Noprop networks 48 training without backtracking 49 weightless networks 50 51 and nonconnectionist neural networks Learning paradigms edit This section includes a list of references related reading or external links but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations Please help to improve this section by introducing more precise citations August 2019 Learn how and when to remove this template message The three major learning paradigms are supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning They each correspond to a particular learning task Supervised learning edit Supervised learning uses a set of paired inputs and desired outputs The learning task is to produce the desired output for each input In this case the cost function is related to eliminating incorrect deductions 52 A commonly used cost is the meansquared error which tries to minimize the average squared error between the networks output and the desired output Tasks suited for supervised learning are pattern recognition also known as classification and regression also known as function approximation Supervised learning is also applicable to sequential data eg for hand writing speech and gesture recognition This can be thought of as learning with a teacher in the form of a function that provides continuous feedback on the quality of solutions obtained thus far Unsupervised learning edit In unsupervised learning input data is given along with the cost function some function of the data x displaystyle textstyle x and the networks output The cost function is dependent on the task the model domain and any a priori assumptions the implicit properties of the model its parameters and the observed variables As a trivial example consider the model f x a displaystyle textstyle fxa where a displaystyle textstyle a is a constant and the cost C E x f x 2 displaystyle textstyle CExfx2 Minimizing this cost produces a value of a displaystyle textstyle a that is equal to the mean of the data The cost function can be much more complicated Its form depends on the application for example in compression it could be related to the mutual information between x displaystyle textstyle x and f x displaystyle textstyle fx whereas in statistical modeling it could be related to the posterior probability of the model given the data note that in both of those examples those quantities would be maximized rather than minimized Tasks that fall within the paradigm of unsupervised learning are in general estimation problems the applications include clustering the estimation of statistical distributions compression and filtering Reinforcement learning edit Main article Reinforcement learning See also Stochastic control In applications such as playing video games an actor takes a string of actions receiving a generally unpredictable response from the environment after each one The goal is to win the game ie generate the most positive lowest cost responses In reinforcement learning the aim is to weight the network devise a policy to perform actions that minimize longterm expected cumulative cost at each point in time the agent performs an action and the environment generates an observation and an instantaneous cost according to some usually unknown rules The rules and the longterm cost usually only can be estimated At any juncture the agent decides whether to explore new actions to uncover their costs or to exploit prior learning to proceed more quickly Formally the environment is modeled as a Markov decision process MDP with states s 1 s n S displaystyle textstyle s1snin S and actions a 1 a m A displaystyle textstyle a1amin A Because the state transitions are not known probability distributions are used instead the instantaneous cost distribution P c t s t displaystyle textstyle Pctst the observation distribution P x t s t displaystyle textstyle Pxtst and the transition distribution P s t 1 s t a t displaystyle textstyle Pst1stat while a policy is defined as the conditional distribution over actions given the observations Taken together the two define a Markov chain MC The aim is to discover the lowestcost MC ANNs serve as the learning component in such applications 53 54 Dynamic programming coupled with ANNs giving neurodynamic programming 55 has been applied to problems such as those involved in vehicle routing 56 video games natural resource management 57 58 and medicine 59 because of ANNs ability to mitigate losses of accuracy even when reducing the discretization grid density for numerically approximating the solution of control problems Tasks that fall within the paradigm of reinforcement learning are control problems games and other sequential decision making tasks Self learning edit Self learning in neural networks was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of selflearning named Crossbar Adaptive Array CAA 60 It is a system with only one input situation s and only one output action or behavior a It has neither external advice input nor external reinforcement input from the environment The CAA computes in a crossbar fashion both decisions about actions and emotions feelings about encountered situations The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion 61 Given memory matrix W was the crossbar self learning algorithm in each iteration performs the following computation In situation s perform action a Receive consequence situation s Compute emotion of being in consequence situation vs Update crossbar memory was was vs The backpropagated value secondary reinforcement is the emotion toward the consequence situation The CAA exists in two environments one is behavioral environment where it behaves and the other is genetic environment where from it initially and only once receives initial emotions about to be encountered situations in the behavioral environment Having received the genome vector species vector from the genetic environment the CAA will learn a goalseeking behavior in the behavioral environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations 62 Other edit In a Bayesian framework a distribution over the set of allowed models is chosen to minimize the cost Evolutionary

remain unclear because it lacks inline citations Please help to improve this section by introducing more precise citations August 2019 Learn how and when to remove this template message Two modes of learning are available stochastic and batch In stochastic learning each input creates a weight adjustment In batch learning weights are adjusted based on a batch of inputs accumulating errors over the batch Stochastic learning introduces noise into the process using the local gradient calculated from one data point this reduces the chance of the network getting stuck in local minima However batch learning typically yields a faster more stable descent to a local minimum since each update is performed in the direction of the batchs average error A common compromise is to use minibatches small batches with samples in each batch selected stochastically from the entire data set Types edit Main article Types of artificial neural networks ANNs have evolved into a broad family of techniques that have advanced the state of the art across multiple domains The simplest types have one or more static components including number of units number of layers unit weights and topology Dynamic types allow one or more of these to evolve via learning The latter are much more complicated but can shorten learning periods and produce better results Some types allowrequire learning to be supervised by the operator while others operate independently Some types operate purely in hardware while others are purely software and run on general purpose computers Some of the main breakthroughs include

that compare well with handdesigned systems The basic search algorithm is to propose a candidate model evaluate it against a dataset and use the results as feedback to teach the NAS network 79 Available systems include AutoML and AutoKeras 80 Design issues include deciding the number type and connectedness of network layers as well as the size of each and the connection type full pooling Hyperparameters must also be defined as part of the design they are not learned governing matters such as how many neurons are in each layer learning rate step stride depth receptive field and padding

analysis of infrastructures subject to natural disasters 93 94 and to predict foundation settlements 95 ANNs have also been used for building blackbox models in geoscience hydrology 96 97 ocean modelling and coastal engineering 98 99 and geomorphology 100 ANNs have been employed in cybersecurity with the objective to discriminate between legitimate activities and malicious ones For example machine learning has been used for classifying Android malware 101 for identifying domains belonging to threat actors and for detecting URLs posing a security risk 102 Research is underway on ANN

systems 105 106 107 108 In brain research ANNs have studied shortterm behavior of individual neurons 109 the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems Studies considered longand shortterm plasticity of neural systems and their relation to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level Theoretical properties edit Computational power edit The multilayer perceptron is a universal function approximator as proven by the universal approximation theorem However the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required the network topology the weights and the learning parameters A specific recurrent architecture with rational valued weights as opposed to full precision real number valued weights has the power of a universal Turing machine 110 using a finite number of neurons and standard linear connections Further the use of irrational values for weights results in a machine with superTuring power 111 Capacity edit A models capacity property roughly corresponds to its ability to model any given function It is related to the amount of information that can be stored in the network and to the notion of complexity citation needed Convergence edit Models may not consistently converge on a single solution firstly because local minima may exist depending on the cost function and the model Secondly the optimization method used might not guarantee to converge when it begins far from any local minimum Thirdly for sufficiently large data or parameters some methods become impractical Convergence behavior of certain types of ANN architectures are more understood than others Such as when the width of network approaches to infinity the ANN resembles linear model thus such ANN follows the convergence behavior of linear model also 112 Another example is when parameters are small it is observed that ANN often fits target functions from low to high frequencies 113 114 115 116 Such phenomenon is in opposite to the behavior of some well studied iterative numerical schemes such as Jacobi method Generalization

introducing more precise citations August 2019 Learn how and when to remove this template message Applications whose goal is to create a system that generalizes well to unseen examples face the possibility of overtraining This arises in convoluted or overspecified systems when the network capacity significantly exceeds the needed free parameters Two approaches address overtraining The first is to use crossvalidation and similar techniques to check for the presence of overtraining and to select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error The second is to use some form of regularization This concept emerges in a probabilistic Bayesian framework where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models but also in statistical learning theory where the goal is to minimize over two quantities the empirical risk and the structural risk which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to overfitting Confidence analysis of a neural network Supervised neural networks that use a mean squared error MSE cost function can use formal statistical methods to determine the confidence of the trained model The MSE on a validation set can be used as an estimate for variance This value can then be used to calculate the confidence interval of network output assuming a normal distribution A confidence analysis made this way is statistically valid as long as the output probability distribution stays the same and the network is not modified By assigning a softmax activation function a generalization of the logistic function on the output layer of the neural network or a softmax component in a componentbased network for categorical target variables the outputs can be interpreted as posterior probabilities This is useful in classification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications The softmax activation function is y i e x i j 1 c e x j displaystyle yifrac exisum j1cexj Criticism edit Training edit A common criticism of neural networks particularly in robotics is that they require too much training for realworld operation citation needed Potential solutions include randomly shuffling training examples by using a numerical optimization algorithm that does not take too large steps when changing the network connections following an example grouping examples in socalled minibatches andor introducing a recursive least squares algorithm for CMAC 67 Theory edit A fundamental objection is that ANNs do not sufficiently reflect neuronal function Backpropagation is a critical step although no such mechanism exists in biological neural networks 117 How information is coded by real neurons is not known Sensor neurons fire action potentials more frequently with sensor activation and muscle cells pull more strongly when their associated motor neurons receive action potentials more frequently 118 Other than the case of relaying information from a sensor neuron to a motor neuron almost nothing of the principles of how information is handled by biological neural networks is known A central claim of ANNs is that they embody new and powerful general principles for processing information Unfortunately these principles are illdefined It is often claimed that they are emergent from the network itself This allows simple statistical association the basic function of artificial neural networks to be described as learning or recognition Alexander Dewdney commented that as a result artificial neural networks have a somethingfornothing quality one that imparts a peculiar aura of laziness and a distinct lack of curiosity about just how good these computing systems are No human hand or mind intervenes solutions are found as if by magic and no one it seems has learned anything 119 One response to Dewdney is that neural networks handle many complex and diverse tasks ranging from autonomously flying aircraft 120 to detecting credit card fraud to mastering the game of Go Technology writer Roger Bridgman commented mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote

could create a successful net without understanding how it worked the bunch of numbers that captures its behaviour would in all probability be an opaque unreadable tablevalueless as a scientific resource In spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology Dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them are just trying to be good engineers An unreadable table that a useful machine could read would still be well worth having 121 Biological brains use both shallow and deep circuits as reported by brain anatomy 122 displaying a wide variety of invariance Weng 123 argued that the brain selfwires largely according to signal statistics and therefore a serial cascade cannot catch all major statistical dependencies Hardware edit Large and effective neural networks require considerable computing resources 124 While the brain has hardware tailored to the task of processing signals through a graph of neurons simulating even a simplified neuron on von Neumann architecture may consume vast amounts of memory and storage Furthermore the designer often needs to transmit signals through many of these connections and their associated neurons which require enormous CPU power and time Schmidhuber noted that the resurgence of neural networks in the twentyfirst century is largely attributable to advances in hardware from 1991 to 2015 computing power especially as delivered by GPGPUs on GPUs has increased around a millionfold making the standard backpropagation algorithm feasible for training networks that are several layers deeper than before 125 The use of accelerators such as FPGAs and GPUs can reduce training times from months to days 126 124 Neuromorphic engineering addresses the hardware difficulty directly by constructing nonvonNeumann chips to directly implement neural networks in circuitry Another type of chip optimized for neural network processing is called a Tensor Processing Unit or TPU 127 Practical counterexamples edit Analyzing what has been learned by an ANN is much easier than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network Furthermore researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful For example local vs nonlocal learning and shallow vs deep
