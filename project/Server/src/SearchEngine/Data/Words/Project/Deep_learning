of Abstraction in Deep Learning 10 Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that 11 pp199200 uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from the raw input For example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces Overview edit Most modern deep learning models are based on artificial neural networks specifically Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layerwise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines 12 In deep learning each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation In an image recognition application the raw input may be a matrix of pixels the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges the third layer may encode a nose and eyes and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face Importantly a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own Of course this does not completely eliminate the need for handtuning for example varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction 1 13 The word deep in deep learning refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed More precisely deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path CAP depth The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output For a feedforward neural network the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one as the output layer is also parameterized For recurrent neural networks in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once the CAP depth is potentially unlimited 2 No universally agreed upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than 2 CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function 14 Beyond that more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network Deep models CAP 2 are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence extra layers help in learning the features effectively Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layerbylayer method 15 Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance 1 For supervised learning tasks deep learning methods eliminate feature engineering by translating the data into compact intermediate representations akin to principal components and derive layered structures that remove redundancy in representation Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks This is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than the labeled data Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are neural history compressors 16 and deep belief networks 1 17 Interpretations edit Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem 18 19 20 21 22 23 or probabilistic inference 11 12 1 2 17 24 25 The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions 18 19 20 21 22 In 1989 the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions 19 and was generalised to feedforward multilayer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik 20 Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for nonbounded activation functions such as the rectified linear unit 26 The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow Lu et al 23 proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function If the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension then deep neural network is not a universal approximator The probabilistic interpretation 24 derives from the field of machine learning It features inference 11 12 1 2 17 24 as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing related to fitting and generalization respectively More specifically the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function 24 The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks 27 The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop 28 History edit The term Deep Learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986 29 16 and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000 in the context of Boolean threshold neurons 30 31 The first general working learning algorithm for supervised deep feedforward multilayer perceptrons was published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965 32 A 1971 paper described already a deep network with 8 layers trained by the group method of data handling algorithm 33 Other deep learning working architectures specifically those built for computer vision began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980 34 In 1989 Yann LeCun et al applied the standard backpropagation algorithm which had been around as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation since 1970 35 36 37 38 to a deep neural network with the purpose of recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail While the algorithm worked training required 3 days 39 By 1991 such systems were used for recognizing isolated 2D handwritten digits while recognizing 3D objects was done by matching 2D images with a handcrafted 3D object model Weng et al suggested that a human brain does not use a monolithic 3D object model and in 1992 they published Cresceptron 40 41 42 a method for performing 3D object recognition in cluttered scenes Because it directly used natural images Cresceptron started the beginning of generalpurpose visual learning for natural 3D worlds Cresceptron is a cascade of layers similar to Neocognitron But while Neocognitron required a human programmer to handmerge features Cresceptron learned an open number of features in each layer without supervision where each feature is represented by a convolution kernel Cresceptron segmented each learned object from a cluttered scene through backanalysis through the network Max pooling now often adopted by deep neural networks eg ImageNet tests was first used in Cresceptron to reduce the position resolution by a factor of 2x2 to 1 through the cascade for better generalization In 1994 André de Carvalho together with Mike Fairhurst and David Bisset published experimental results of a multilayer boolean neural network also known as a weightless neural network composed of a 3layers selforganising feature extraction neural network module SOFT followed by a multilayer classification neural network module GSN which were independently trained Each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer 43 In 1995 Brendan Frey demonstrated that it was possible to train over two days a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wakesleep algorithm codeveloped with Peter Dayan and Hinton 44 Many factors contribute to the slow speed including the vanishing gradient problem analyzed in 1991 by Sepp Hochreiter 45 46 Simpler models that use taskspecific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines SVMs were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s because of artificial neural network s ANN computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks Both shallow and deep learning eg recurrent nets of ANNs have been explored for many years 47 48 49 These methods never outperformed nonuniform internalhandcrafting Gaussian mixture model Hidden Markov model GMMHMM technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively 50 Key difficulties have been analyzed including gradient diminishing 45 and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models 51 52 Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s Funded by the US governments NSA and DARPA SRI studied deep neural networks in speech and speaker recognition The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology Speaker Recognition evaluation 53 The SRI deep neural network was then deployed in the Nuance Verifier representing the first major industrial application of deep learning 54 The principle of elevating raw features over handcrafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the raw spectrogram or linear filterbank features in the late 1990s 54 showing its superiority over the MelCepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms The raw features of speech waveforms later produced excellent largerscale results 55 Many aspects of speech recognition were taken over by a deep learning method called long shortterm memory LSTM a recurrent neural network published by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997 56 LSTM RNNs avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn Very Deep Learning tasks 2 that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before which is important for speech In 2003 LSTM started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks 57 Later it was combined with connectionist temporal classification CTC 58 in stacks of LSTM RNNs 59 In 2015 Googles speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49 through CTCtrained LSTM which they made available through Google Voice Search 60 In 2006 publications by Geoff Hinton Ruslan Salakhutdinov Osindero and Teh 61 62 63 showed how a manylayered feedforward neural network could be effectively pretrained one layer at a time treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine then finetuning it using supervised backpropagation 64 The papers referred to learning for deep belief nets Deep learning is part of stateoftheart systems in various disciplines particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition ASR Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT ASR and MNIST image classification as well as a range of largevocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved 65 66 67 Convolutional neural networks CNNs were superseded for ASR by CTC 58 for LSTM 56 60 68 69 70 71 72 but are more successful in computer vision The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s when CNNs already processed an estimated 10 to 20 of all the checks written in the US according to Yann LeCun 73 Industrial applications of deep learning to largescale speech recognition started around 2010 The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition 74 was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech and the possibility that given more capable hardware and largescale data sets that deep neural nets DNN might become practical It was believed that pretraining DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets DBN would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets 75 However it was discovered that replacing pretraining with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large contextdependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than thenstateoftheart Gaussian mixture model GMMHidden Markov Model HMM and also than moreadvanced generative modelbased systems 65 76 The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different 77 74 offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient runtime speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems 11 78 79 Analysis around 20092010 contrasted the GMM and other generative speech models vs DNN models stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition 77 74 eventually leading to pervasive and dominant use in that industry That analysis was done with comparable performance less than 15 in error rate between discriminative DNNs and generative models 65 77 75 80 In 2010 researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on contextdependent HMM states constructed by decision trees 81 82 83 78 Advances in hardware have enabled renewed interest in deep learning In 2009 Nvidia was involved in what was called the big bang of deep learning as deeplearning neural networks were trained with Nvidia graphics processing units GPUs 84 That year Google Brain used Nvidia GPUs to create capable DNNs While there Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deeplearning systems by about 100 times 85 In particular GPUs are wellsuited for the matrixvector computations involved in machine learning 86 87 88 GPUs speed up training algorithms by orders of magnitude reducing running times from weeks to days 89 90 Further specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations can be used for efficient processing of deep learning models 91 Deep learning revolution edit How deep learning is a subset of machine learning and how machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence AI In 2012 a team led by George E Dahl won the Merck Molecular Activity Challenge using multitask deep neural networks to predict the biomolecular target of one drug 92 93 In 2014 Hochreiters group used deep learning to detect offtarget and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients household products and drugs and won the Tox21 Data Challenge of NIH FDA and NCATS 94 95 96 Significant additional impacts in image or object recognition were felt from 2011 to 2012 Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades and GPU implementations of NNs for years including CNNs fast implementations of CNNs with maxpooling on GPUs in the style of Ciresan and colleagues were needed to progress on computer vision 86 88 39 97 2 In 2011 this approach achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest Also in 2011 it won the ICDAR Chinese handwriting contest and in May 2012 it won the ISBI image segmentation contest 98 Until 2011 CNNs did not play a major role at computer vision conferences but in June 2012 a paper by Ciresan et al at the leading conference CVPR 4 showed how maxpooling CNNs on GPU can dramatically improve many vision benchmark records In October 2012 a similar system by Krizhevsky et al 5 won the largescale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods In November 2012 Ciresan et als system also won the ICPR contest on analysis of large medical images for cancer detection and in the following year also the MICCAI Grand Challenge on the same topic 99 In 2013 and 2014 the error rate on the ImageNet task using deep learning was further reduced following a similar trend in largescale speech recognition The Wolfram Image Identification project publicized these improvements 100 Image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions captions for images often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs 101 102 103 104 Some researchers assess that the October 2012 ImageNet victory anchored the start of a deep learning revolution that has transformed the AI industry 105 In March 2019 Yoshua Bengio Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the Turing Award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing Neural networks edit Artificial neural networks edit Main article Artificial neural network Artificial neural networks ANNs or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains Such systems learn progressively improve their ability to do tasks by considering examples generally without taskspecific programming For example in image recognition they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as cat or no cat and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rulebased programming An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain Each connection synapse between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron The receiving postsynaptic neuron can process the signals and then signal downstream neurons connected to it Neurons may have state generally represented by real numbers typically between 0 and 1 Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream Typically neurons are organized in layers Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs Signals travel from the first input to the last output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would Over time attention focused on matching specific mental abilities leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis As of 2017 neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans eg recognizing faces playing Go 106 Deep neural networks edit This section may be too technical for most readers to understand Please help improve it to make it understandable to nonexperts without removing the technical details July 2016 Learn how and when to remove this template message A deep neural network DNN is an artificial neural network ANN with multiple layers between the input and output layers 12 2 The DNN finds the correct mathematical manipulation to turn the input into the output whether it be a linear relationship or a nonlinear relationship The network moves through the layers calculating the probability of each output For example a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display above a certain threshold etc and return the proposed label Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer and complex DNN have many layers hence the name deep networks DNNs can model complex nonlinear relationships DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives 107 The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network 12 Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches Each architecture has found success in specific domains It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back At first the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values or weights to connections between them The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1 If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern an algorithm would adjust the weights 108 That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data Recurrent neural networks RNNs in which data can flow in any direction are used for applications such as language modeling 109 110 111 112 113 Long shortterm memory is particularly effective for this use 56 114 Convolutional deep neural networks CNNs are used in computer vision 115 CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition ASR 72 Challenges edit As with ANNs many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs Two common issues are overfitting and computation time DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenkos unit pruning 33 or weight decay ℓ 2 displaystyle ell 2 regularization or sparsity ℓ 1 displaystyle ell 1 regularization can be applied during training to combat overfitting 116 Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training This helps to exclude rare dependencies 117 Finally data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting 118 DNNs must consider many training parameters such as the size number of layers and number of units per layer the learning rate and initial weights Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources Various tricks such as batching computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples 119 speed up computation Large processing capabilities of manycore architectures such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi have produced significant speedups in training because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations 120 121 Alternatively engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms CMAC cerebellar model articulation controller is one such kind of neural network It doesnt require learning rates or randomized initial weights for CMAC The training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved 122 123 Applications edit Automatic speech recognition edit Main article Speech recognition Largescale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning LSTM RNNs can learn Very Deep Learning tasks 2 that involve multisecond intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms LSTM with forget gates 114 is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks 57 The initial success in speech recognition was based on smallscale recognition tasks based on TIMIT The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English where each speaker reads 10 sentences 124 Its small size lets many configurations be tried More importantly the TIMIT task concerns phonesequence recognition which unlike wordsequence recognition allows weak phone bigram language models This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed The

voice search and a range of Nuance speech products etc are based on deep learning 11 129 130 131 Image recognition edit Main article Computer vision A common evaluation set for image classification is the MNIST database data set MNIST is composed of handwritten digits and includes 60000 training examples and 10000 test examples As with TIMIT its small size lets users test multiple configurations A comprehensive list of results on this set is available 132 Deep learningbased image recognition has become superhuman producing more accurate results than human contestants This first occurred in 2011 133 Deep learningtrained vehicles now interpret 360 camera views 134 Another example is Facial Dysmorphology Novel Analysis FDNA used to analyze cases of human malformation connected to a large database of genetic syndromes Visual art processing edit Closely related to the progress that has been made in image recognition is the increasing application of deep learning techniques to various visual art tasks DNNs have proven themselves capable for example of a identifying the style period of a given painting b Neural Style Transfer capturing the style of a given artwork and applying it in a visually pleasing manner to an arbitrary photograph or video and c generating striking imagery based on random visual input fields 135 136 Natural language processing edit Main article Natural language processing Neural networks have been used for implementing language models since the early 2000s 109 137 LSTM helped to improve machine translation and language modeling 110 111 112 Other key techniques in this field are negative sampling 138 and word embedding Word embedding such as word2vec can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset the position is represented as a point in a vector space Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar A compositional vector grammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar PCFG implemented by an RNN 139 Recursive autoencoders built atop word embeddings can assess sentence similarity and detect paraphrasing 139 Deep neural architectures provide the best results for constituency parsing 140 sentiment analysis 141 information retrieval 142 143 spoken language understanding 144 machine translation 110 145 contextual entity linking 145 writing style recognition 146 Text classification and others 147 Recent developments generalize word embedding to sentence embedding Google Translate GT uses a large endtoend long shortterm memory network 148 149 150 151 152 153 Google Neural Machine Translation GNMT uses an examplebased machine translation method in which the system learns from millions of examples 149 It translates whole sentences at a time rather than pieces Google Translate supports over one hundred languages 149 The network encodes the semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrasetophrase translations 149 154 GT uses English as an intermediate between most language pairs 154 Drug discovery and toxicology edit For more information see Drug discovery and Toxicology A large percentage of candidate drugs fail to win regulatory approval These failures are caused by insufficient efficacy ontarget effect undesired interactions offtarget effects or unanticipated toxic effects 155 156 Research has explored use of deep learning to predict the biomolecular targets 92 93 offtargets and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients household products and drugs 94 95 96 AtomNet is a deep learning system for structurebased rational drug design 157 AtomNet was used to predict novel candidate biomolecules for disease targets such as the Ebola virus 158 and multiple sclerosis 159 160 In 2019 generative neural networks were used to produce molecules that were validated experimentally all the way into mice 161 162 Customer relationship management edit Main article Customer relationship management Deep reinforcement learning has been used to approximate the value of possible direct marketing actions defined in terms of RFM variables The estimated value function was shown to have a natural interpretation as customer lifetime value 163 Recommendation systems edit Main article Recommender system Recommendation systems have used deep learning to extract meaningful features for a latent factor model for contentbased music and journal recommendations 164 165 Multiview deep learning has been applied for learning user preferences from multiple domains 166 The model uses a hybrid collaborative and contentbased approach and enhances recommendations in multiple tasks Bioinformatics edit Main article Bioinformatics An autoencoder ANN was used in bioinformatics to predict gene ontology annotations and genefunction relationships 167 In medical informatics deep learning was used to predict sleep quality based on data from wearables 168 and predictions of health complications from electronic health record data 169 Deep learning has also showed efficacy in healthcare 170 Medical Image Analysis edit Deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical application such as cancer cell classification lesion detection organ segmentation and image enhancement 171 172 Mobile advertising edit Finding the appropriate mobile audience for mobile advertising is always challenging since many data points must be considered and assimilated before a target segment can be created and used in ad serving by any ad server 173 Deep learning has been used to interpret large manydimensioned advertising datasets Many data points are collected during the requestserveclick internet advertising cycle This information can form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection Image restoration edit Deep learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems such as denoising superresolution inpainting and film colorization 174 These applications include learning methods such as Shrinkage Fields for Effective Image Restoration 175 which trains on an image dataset and Deep Image Prior which trains on the image that needs restoration Financial fraud detection edit Deep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection and antimoney laundering Deep antimoney laundering detection system can spot and recognize relationships and similarities between data and further down the road learn to detect anomalies or classify and predict specific events The solution leverages both supervised learning techniques such as the classification of suspicious transactions and unsupervised learning eg anomaly detection 176 Military edit The United States Department of Defense applied deep learning to train robots in new tasks through observation 177 Relation to human cognitive and brain development edit Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development specifically neocortical development proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s 178 179 180 181 These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models making them predecessors of deep learning systems These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain eg a wave of nerve growth factor support the selforganization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models Like the neocortex neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer or the operating environment and then passes its output and possibly the original input to other layers This process yields a selforganizing stack of transducers welltuned to their operating environment A 1995 description stated the infants brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of socalled trophicfactors different regions of the brain become connected sequentially with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature 182 A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective On the one hand several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism 183 184 Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks may be closer to biological reality 185 186 In this respect generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about samplingbased processing in the cerebral cortex 187 Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established several analogies have been reported For example the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons 188 189 and neural populations 190 Similarly the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system 191 both at the singleunit 192 and at the population 193 levels Commercial activity edit Facebook s AI lab performs tasks such as automatically tagging uploaded pictures with the names of the people in them 194 Googles DeepMind Technologies developed a system capable of learning how to play Atari video games using only pixels as data input In 2015 they demonstrated their AlphaGo system which learned the game of Go well enough to beat a professional Go player 195 196 197 Google Translate uses an LSTM to translate between more than 100 languages In 2015 Blippar demonstrated a mobile augmented reality application that uses deep learning to recognize objects in real time 198 In 2017 Covariantai was launched which focuses on integrating deep learning into factories 199 As of 2008 200 researchers at The University of Texas at Austin UT developed a machine learning framework called Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement or TAMER which proposed new methods for robots or computer programs to learn how to perform tasks by interacting with a human instructor 177 First developed as TAMER a new algorithm called Deep TAMER was later introduced in 2018 during a collaboration between US Army Research Laboratory ARL and UT researchers Deep TAMER used deep learning to provide a robot the ability to learn new tasks through observation 177 Using Deep TAMER a robot learned a task with a human trainer watching video streams or observing a human perform a task inperson The robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from the trainer who provided feedback such as good job and bad job 201 Criticism and comment edit Deep learning has attracted both criticism and comment in some cases from outside the field of computer science Theory edit See also Explainable AI A main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods 202 Learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using wellunderstood gradient descent However the theory surrounding other algorithms such as contrastive divergence is less clear citation needed eg Does it converge If so how fast What is it approximating Deep learning methods are often looked at as a black box with most confirmations done empirically rather than theoretically 203 Others point out that deep learning should be looked at as a step towards realizing strong AI not as an allencompassing solution Despite the power of deep learning methods they still lack much of the functionality needed for realizing this goal entirely Research psychologist Gary Marcus noted Realistically deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines Such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge such as information about what objects are what they are for and how they are typically used The most powerful AI systems like Watson use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques ranging from the statistical technique of Bayesian inference to deductive reasoning 204 As an alternative to this emphasis on the limits of deep learning one author speculated that it might be possible to train a machine vision stack to perform the sophisticated task of discriminating between old master and amateur figure drawings and hypothesized that such a sensitivity might represent the rudiments of a nontrivial machine empathy 205 This same author proposed that this would be in line with anthropology which identifies a concern with aesthetics as a key element of behavioral modernity 206 In further reference to the idea that artistic sensitivity might inhere within relatively low levels of the cognitive hierarchy a published series of graphic representations of the internal states of deep 2030 layers neural networks attempting to discern within essentially random data the images on which they were trained 207 demonstrate a visual appeal the original research notice received well over 1000 comments and was the subject of what was for a time the most frequently accessed article on The Guardian s 208 web site Errors edit Some deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors 209 such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images as belonging to a familiar category of ordinary images 210 and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images 211 Goertzel hypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous multicomponent artificial general intelligence AGI architectures 209 These issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internally form states homologous to imagegrammar 212 decompositions of observed entities and events 209 Learning a grammar visual or linguistic from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basic goal of both human language acquisition 213 and artificial intelligence AI 214 Cyber threat edit As deep learning moves from the lab into the world research and experience shows that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception 215 By identifying patterns that these systems use to function attackers can modify inputs to ANNs in such a way that the ANN finds a match that human observers would not recognize For example an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ANN finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target Such a manipulation is termed an adversarial attack 216 In 2016 researchers used one ANN to doctor images in trial and error fashion identify anothers focal points and thereby generate images that deceived it The modified images looked no different to human eyes Another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system 217 One defense is reverse image search in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such as TinEye that can then find other instances of it A refinement is to search using only parts of the image to identify images from which that piece may have been taken 218 Another group showed that certain psychedelic spectacles could fool a facial recognition system into thinking ordinary people were celebrities potentially allowing one person to impersonate another In 2017 researchers added stickers to stop signs and caused an ANN to misclassify them 217 ANNs can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry ANNs have been trained to defeat ANNbased antimalware software by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by a genetic algorithm until it tricked the antimalware while retaining its ability to damage the target 217 Another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the Google Now voice command system open a particular web address that would download malware 217 In data poisoning false data is continually smuggled into a machine learning systems training set to prevent it from achieving mastery 217 Reliance on human microwork edit Most Deep Learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated andor annotated by humans It has been argued in media philosophy that not only lowpayed clickwork eg on Amazon Mechanical Turk is regularly deployed for this purpose but also implicit forms of human microwork that are often not recognized as such 219 The philosopher Rainer Mühlhoff distinguishes five types of machinic capture of human microwork to generate training data 1 gamification the embedding of annotation or computation tasks in the flow of a game 2 trapping and tracking eg CAPTCHAs for image recognition or clicktracking on Google search results pages 3 exploitation of social motivations eg tagging faces on Facebook to obtain labeled facial images 4 information mining eg by leveraging quantifiedself devices such as activity trackers and 5 clickwork 219 Mühlhoff argues that in most commercial enduser applications of Deep Learning such as Facebooks face recognition system the need for training data does not stop once an ANN is trained Rather there is a continued demand for humangenerated verification datato constantly calibrate and update the ANN For this purpose Facebook introduced the feature that once a user is automatically recognized in an image they receive a notification They can choose whether of not they like to be publicly labeled on the image or tell Facebook that it is not them in the picture 220 This user interface is a mechanism to generate a constant stream of verification data 219 to further train the network in realtime As Mühlhoff argues involvement of human users to generate training and verification data is so typical for most commercial enduser applications of Deep Learning that such systems may be referred to as humanaided artificial intelligence 219 See also edit Applications of artificial intelligence Comparison of deep learning software Compressed sensing Echo state network List of
