Applications Projects Programming languages Glossary Glossary v t e In artificial intelligence an evolutionary algorithm EA is a subset of evolutionary computation 1 a generic populationbased metaheuristic optimization algorithm An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution such as reproduction mutation recombination and selection Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions see also loss function Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes In most real applications of EAs computational complexity is a prohibiting factor 2 In fact this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty However seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems citation needed therefore there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity Contents 1 Implementation 2 Types 3 Comparison to biological processes 4 Related techniques 5 Other populationbased metaheuristic methods 6 Examples 7 Gallery 8 References 9 Bibliography Implementation edit Step One Generate the initial population of individuals randomly First generation Step Two Evaluate the fitness of each individual in that population time limit sufficient fitness achieved etc Step Three Repeat the following regenerational steps until termination Select the bestfit individuals for reproduction Parents Breed new individuals through crossover and mutation operations to give birth to offspring Evaluate the individual fitness of new individuals Replace leastfit population with new individuals Types edit Similar techniques differ in genetic representation and other implementation details and the nature of the particular applied problem Genetic algorithm This is the most popular type of EA One seeks the solution of a problem in the form of strings of numbers traditionally binary although the best representations are usually those that reflect something about the problem being solved 2 by applying operators such as recombination and mutation sometimes one sometimes both This type of EA is often used in optimization problems Genetic programming Here the solutions are in the form of computer programs and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem Evolutionary programming Similar to genetic programming but the structure of the program is fixed and its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve Gene expression programming Like genetic programming GEP also evolves computer programs but it explores a genotypephenotype system where computer programs of different sizes are encoded in linear chromosomes of fixed length Evolution strategy Works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions and typically uses selfadaptive mutation rates Differential evolution Based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for numerical optimization problems Neuroevolution Similar to genetic programming but the genomes represent artificial neural networks by describing structure and connection weights The genome encoding can be direct or indirect Learning classifier system Here the solution is a set of classifiers rules or conditions A MichiganLCS evolves at the level of individual classifiers whereas a PittsburghLCS uses populations of classifiersets Initially classifiers were only binary but now include real neural net or Sexpression types Fitness is typically determined with either a strength or accuracy based reinforcement learning or supervised learning approach Comparison to biological processes edit A possible limitation according to whom of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear genotypephenotype distinction In nature the fertilized egg cell undergoes a complex process known as embryogenesis to become a mature phenotype This indirect encoding is believed to make the genetic search more robust ie reduce the probability of fatal mutations and also may improve the evolvability of the organism 3 4 Such indirect aka generative or developmental encodings also enable evolution to exploit the regularity in the environment 5 Recent work in the field of artificial embryogeny or artificial developmental systems seeks to address these concerns And gene expression programming successfully explores a genotypephenotype system where the genotype consists of linear multigenic chromosomes of fixed length and the phenotype consists of multiple expression trees or computer programs of different sizes and shapes 6 improper synthesis Related techniques edit Swarm algorithms clarification needed include Ant colony optimization Based on the ideas of ant foraging by pheromone communication to form paths Primarily suited for combinatorial optimization and graph problems The runnerroot algorithm RRA is inspired by the function of runners and roots of plants in nature 7 Artificial bee colony algorithm Based on the honey bee foraging behaviour Primarily proposed for numerical optimization and extended to solve combinatorial constrained and multiobjective optimization problems Bees algorithm is based on the foraging behaviour of honey bees It has been applied in many applications such as routing and scheduling Cuckoo search is inspired by the brooding parasitism of the cuckoo species It also uses Lévy flights and thus it suits for global optimization problems Electimize optimization Based on the behavior of electron flow through electric circuit branches with the least electric resistance 8 Particle swarm optimization Based on the ideas of animal flocking behaviour Also primarily suited for numerical optimization problems Other populationbased metaheuristic methods edit Hunting Search A method inspired by the group hunting of some animals such as wolves that organize their position to surround the prey each of them relative to the position of the others and especially that of their leader It is a continuous optimization method 9 adapted as a combinatorial optimization method 10 Adaptive dimensional search Unlike natureinspired metaheuristic techniques an adaptive dimensional search algorithm does not implement any metaphor as an underlying principle Rather it uses a simple performanceoriented method based on the update of the search dimensionality ratio SDR parameter at each iteration 11 Firefly algorithm is inspired by the behavior of fireflies attracting each other by flashing light This is especially useful for multimodal optimization Harmony search Based on the ideas of musicians behavior in searching for better harmonies This algorithm is suitable for combinatorial optimization as well as parameter optimization Gaussian adaptation Based on information theory Used for maximization of manufacturing yield mean fitness or average information See for instance Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory Memetic algorithm A hybrid method inspired by Richard Dawkins s notion of a meme it commonly takes the form of a populationbased algorithm coupled with individual learning procedures capable of performing local refinements Emphasizes the exploitation of problemspecific knowledge and tries to orchestrate local and global search in a synergistic way Emperor Penguins Colony A method inspired by the behavior of emperor penguins in their colony The emperor penguins in the colony seek to create the appropriate heat and regulate their body temperature and this heat is completely coordinated and controlled by the movement of the penguins 12 Examples edit The computer simulations Tierra and
