classification of images The error rate of AI by year Red line the error rate of a trained human on a particular task Artificial intelligence applications have been used in a wide range of fields including medical diagnosis stock trading robot control law scientific discovery and toys However many AI applications are not perceived as AI A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled AI anymore 1 2 Many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry 3 In the late 1990s and early 21st century AI technology became widely used as elements of larger systems 3 4 but the field is rarely credited for these successes Kaplan and Haenlein structure artificial intelligence along three evolutionary stages 1 artificial narrow intelligence applying AI only to specific tasks 2 artificial general intelligence applying AI to several areas and able to autonomously solve problems they were never even designed for and 3 artificial super intelligence applying AI to any area capable of scientific creativity social skills and general wisdom 2 To allow comparison with human performance artificial intelligence can be evaluated on constrained and welldefined problems Such tests have been termed subject matter expert Turing tests Also smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an everincreasing number of positive results Contents 1 Current performance 11 Optimal 12 Superhuman 13 Highhuman 14

feature of human beings for its basis 13 Yet there are many other useful abilities that can be described as showing some form of intelligence This gives better insight into the comparative success of artificial intelligence in different areas In what has been called the Feigenbaum test the inventor of expert systems argued for subject specific expert tests 14 A paper by Jim Gray of Microsoft in 2003 suggested extending the Turing test to speech understanding speaking and recognizing objects and behavior 15 AI like electricity or the steam engine is a general purpose technology There is no consensus on how to characterize which tasks AI tends to excel at 16 Some versions of Moravecs paradox observe that humans are more likely to outperform machines in areas such as physical dexterity that have been the direct target of natural selection 17 While projects such as AlphaZero have succeeded in generating their own knowledge from scratch many other machine learning projects require large training datasets 18 19 Researcher Andrew Ng has suggested as a highly imperfect rule of thumb that almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI 20 Games provide a highprofile benchmark for assessing rates of progress many games have a large professional player base and a wellestablished competitive rating system AlphaGo brought the era of classical boardgame benchmarks to a close Games of imperfect knowledge provide new challenges to AI in the area of game theory the most prominent milestone in this area was brought to a close by Libratus poker victory in 2017 21 22 Esports continue to provide additional benchmarks Facebook AI Deepmind and others have engaged with the popular StarCraft franchise of videogames 23 24 Broad classes of outcome for an AI test may be given as optimal it is not possible to perform better note some of these entries were solved by humans superhuman

Within a generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved 68 Four polls conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggested that the median estimate among experts for when AGI would arrive was 2040 to 2050 depending on the poll 69 70 The Grace poll around 2016 found results varied depending on how the question was framed Respondents asked to estimate when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers gave an aggregated median answer of 45 years and a 10 chance of it occurring within 9 years Other respondents asked to estimate when all occupations are fully automatable That is when for any occupation machines could be built to carry out the task better and more cheaply than human workers estimated a median of 122 years and a 10 probability of 20 years The median response for when AI researcher could be fully automated was around 90 years No link was found between seniority and optimism but Asian researchers were much
