Separation of content and presentation Concept in technology design An example of CSS Code which makes up the visual and styling components of a web page Separation of content and presentation or separation of content and style is the separation of concerns design principle as applied to the authoring and presentation of content Under this principle visual and design aspects presentation and style are separated from the core material and structure content of a document 1 2 3 A typical analogy used to explain this principle is the distinction between the human skeleton as the structural component and human flesh as the visual component which makes up the bodys appearance Common applications of this principle are seen in Web design HTML vs CSS 4 5 and document typesetting LaTeX s document body vs its preamble Contents 1 Use in Web design 2 Use in document typesetting 3 See also 4 References Use in Web design edit This principle is not a rigid guideline but serves more as best practice for keeping appearance and structure separate In many cases the design and development aspects of a project are performed by different people so keeping both aspects separated ensures both initial production accountability and later maintenance simplification as in the dont repeat yourself DRY principle Use in document typesetting edit LaTeX is a document markup language that focuses primarily on the content and structure of a document When a document is prepared using the LaTeX system the source code of the document can be divided into two parts the document body and the preamble and the style sheets The document body can be likened to the body of a HTML document where one specifies the content and the structure of the document whereas the preamble and the style sheets can be likened to the CSS portion of a HTML document where the formatting document specifications and other visual attributes are specified Under this methodology academic writings and publications can be structured styled and typeset with minimal effort by its creators In fact it also prevents the endusers who are usually not trained as designers themselves from alternating between tweaking the formatting and working on the document itself 3 Similar to the case with HTML and CSS the separation between content and style also allows a document to be quickly reformatted for different purposes or a style to be repurposed across multiple documents as well 6 See also edit CSS Form follows function HTML LaTeX Markdown Modelviewcontroller software architectural pattern Structure follows strategy References edit Separation The Web Designers Dilemma A List Apart Retrieved 24 May 2017 mwparseroutput citecitationfontstyleinheritmwparseroutput citation qquotesmwparseroutput citation cs1lockfree abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb665Lockgreensvg9pxLockgreensvgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput citation cs1locklimited amwparseroutput citation cs1lockregistration abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbdd6Lockgrayalt2svg9pxLockgrayalt2svgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput citation cs1locksubscription abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbaaaLockredalt2svg9pxLockredalt2svgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput cs1subscriptionmwparseroutput cs1registrationcolor555mwparseroutput cs1subscription spanmwparseroutput cs1registration spanborderbottom1px dottedcursorhelpmwparseroutput cs1wsicon abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb44cWikisourcelogosvg12pxWikisourcelogosvgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput codecs1codecolorinheritbackgroundinheritborderinheritpaddinginheritmwparseroutput cs1hiddenerrordisplaynonefontsize100mwparseroutput cs1visibleerrorfontsize100mwparseroutput cs1maintdisplaynonecolor33aa33marginleft03emmwparseroutput cs1subscriptionmwparseroutput cs1registrationmwparseroutput cs1formatfontsize95mwparseroutput cs1kernleftmwparseroutput cs1kernwlleftpaddingleft02emmwparseroutput cs1kernrightmwparseroutput cs1kernwlrightpaddingright02em Ferrel PJ Meyer RF Millet SJ Shewchuk JP Smith WW March 6 2001 Method for delivering separate design and content in a multimedia publishing system USPTO Patent 6199082 a b The Definitive NonTechnical Introduction to LaTeX Professional Typesetting and Scientific Publishing Math Vault 20150905 Retrieved 20190718 Separating Content and Appearance Simon Fraser University Retrieved 24 May 2017 Clark Dave 2007 Content Management and the Separation of Presentation and Content Technical Communication Quarterly 17 1 3560 doi 10108010572250701588624 ISSN 10572252 Separation of Presentation and Content LispCast 20140418 Retrieved 20190718
