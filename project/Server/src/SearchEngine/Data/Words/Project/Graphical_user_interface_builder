Graphical user interface builder A graphical user interface builder or GUI builder also known as GUI designer is a software development tool that simplifies the creation of GUIs by allowing the designer to arrange graphical control elements often called widgets using a draganddrop WYSIWYG editor Without a GUI builder a GUI must be built by manually specifying each widgets parameters in sourcecode with no visual feedback until the program is run User interfaces are commonly programmed using an eventdriven architecture so GUI builders also simplify creating eventdriven code This supporting code connects widgets with the outgoing and incoming events that trigger the functions providing the application logic Some graphical user interface builders such as eg Glade Interface Designer automatically generate all the source code for a graphical control element Others like Interface Builder generate serialized object instances that are then loaded by the application Contents 1 List of GUI builders 11 C Language Based 12 C Based 13 C Based 14 ObjectiveC Swift Based 15 JavaBased 16 HTMLJavascript Based 17 Object Pascal Based 18 Tk Framework Based 19 Visual Basic Based 110 Misc 2 List of development environments 21 IDEs with GUI builders 3 See also List of GUI builders edit C Language Based edit GTK Glade Interface Designer XForms toolkit Intrinsics Motif C Based edit UWP Windows Presentation Foundation WinForms Microsoft Visual Studio XAML Editor XAML based GUI layout Microsoft Expression Blend SharpDevelop XarmarinForms NET Core Xamarin Studio C Based edit UWP Windows Presentation Foundation WinForms Microsoft Visual Studio XAML Editor XAML based GUI layout Microsoft Expression Blend CBuilder VCL Visual Component Library Gtkmm Gui Builder IDE Qt Creator Qt FLTK wxWidgets wxGlade wxFormBuilder wxCrafter plugin for CodeLite Projucer ObjectiveC Swift Based edit Cocoa OpenStep GNUstep Gorm JavaBased edit Android Studio XML based GUI layout NetBeans GUI design tool HTMLJavascript Based edit DreamWeaver from Adobe Web Application User Interface Builders Apache Cordova PhoneGap Object Pascal Based edit Delphi VCL Visual Component Library Lazarus Tk Framework Based edit Tk framework ActiveState Komodo No longer when has a GUI builder Visual Basic Based edit UWP Windows Presentation Foundation WinForms Microsoft Visual Studio XAML Editor XAML based GUI layout Microsoft Expression Blend Misc edit Adobe Animate App Inventor for Android AutoIt Axure RP Interface Builder Crank Storyboard Suite Embedded Wizard FLUID GEM Resource construction set Stetic LucidChart OpenWindows Scaleform Ultimate Wavemaker List of development environments edit IDEs with GUI builders edit 4D ActiveState Komodo No longer when has a GUI builder Android Studio AutoIt3 CBuilder Clarion CodeBlocks CodeLite dBase Embedded Wizard Delphi Eclipse Gambas IntelliJ IDEA JDeveloper KDevelop LabWindowsCVI LANSA Lazarus Liberty BASIC Microsoft Visual Studio MonoDevelop MSEideMSEgui MyEclipse NetBeans OutSystems PascalABCNET Purebasic Qt Creator SharpDevelop Softwell Maker Xcode Xojo See also edit Human interface guidelines Human interface device User interface markup language User interface modeling DesignOriented Programming Linux on the desktop v t e Widgets Command input Adjustment handle Button Context menu Dropdown list Hamburger button Menu Pie menu Data inputoutput Checkbox Color picker Combo box Cycle button Date picker Grid view Light switch List box List builder Radio button Scrollbar Search box Slider Spinner Text box Informational Balloon help Headup display in computing Headup display in video games Icon Infobar Label Loading screen Progress indicator Progress bar Splash screen Throbber Sidebar Status bar Toast Tooltip Containers Accordion Tree view ClientSide Decoration Disclosure widget Frame Fieldset Menu bar Panel Popover Ribbon Tab Toolbar Window Window decoration Workspace Navigational Address bar Breadcrumb Hyperlink Navigation bar Virtual desktop Special windows Alert dialog box Dialog box File dialog Inspector window Modal window Palette window Related concepts File viewer List of graphical user interface elements Layout manager Look and feel Mouseover Widget toolkit WIMP
