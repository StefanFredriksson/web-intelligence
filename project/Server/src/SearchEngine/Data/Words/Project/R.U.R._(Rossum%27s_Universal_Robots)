RUR For other uses see Rur disambiguation RUR A scene from the play showing three robots Written by Karel Čapek Date premiered 25 January 1921 Original language Czech Genre Science fiction RUR is a 1920 science fiction play by the Czech writer Karel Čapek RUR stands for Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti Rossums Universal Robots 1 The English phrase Rossums Universal Robots has been used as a subtitle 2 It premiered on 25 January 1921 and introduced the word robot to the English language and to science fiction as a whole 3 RUR quickly became influential after its publication 4 5 6 By 1923 it had been translated into thirty languages 4 7 The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called roboti robots from synthetic organic matter They are not exactly robots by the current definition of the term they are living creatures of artificial flesh and blood rather than machinery and are closer to the modern idea of androids or replicants They may be mistaken for humans and can think for themselves They seem happy to work for humans at first but a robot rebellion leads to the extinction of the human race Čapek later took a different approach to the same theme in War with the Newts in which nonhumans become a servant class in human society 8 RUR was successful in its time in Europe and North America 9 Contents 1 Characters 2 Plot 21 Act I 22 Act II 23 Act III 24 Epilogue 3

directed by Remo Bufano in New York 1939 Act I edit Helena the daughter of the president of a major industrial power arrives at the island factory of Rossums Universal Robots She meets Domin the General Manager of RUR who tells her the history of the company In 1920 a man named Rossum came to the island to study marine biology and in 1932 he accidentally discovered a chemical that behaved exactly like protoplasm except that it did not mind being knocked around Rossum attempted to make a dog and a man but failed His nephew came to see him and the two argued nonstop largely because Old Rossum only wanted to create animals to prove that not only was God unnecessary but that there was no God at all and Young Rossum only wanted to make himself rich Eventually Young Rossum locked his uncle in a laboratory to play with his monsters and mutants while Young Rossum built factories and cranked out Robots by the thousands By the time the play takes place around the year 2000 11 Robots are cheap and available all over the world They have become absolutely necessary because they allow products to be made at a fifth the previous cost Helena meets Fabry Dr Gall Alquist Busman and Hallemeier and reveals she is a representative of the League of Humanity a human rights organization that wishes to free the Robots The managers of the factory find this a ridiculous proposition since they see Robots as appliances Helena requests that the Robots be paid so that they can buy things they like but the Robots do not like anything Helena is eventually convinced that the League of Humanity is a waste of money but continues to argue on the fact that robots should still have a soul Later Domin confesses that he loves Helena and forces her into an engagement Act II edit Ten years later Helena and her nurse Nana are talking about current eventsparticularly the decline in human births Helena and Domin reminisce about the day they met and summarize the last ten years of world history which has been shaped by the new worldwide Robotbased economy Helena meets Dr Galls new Robot experiment Radius and Dr Gall describes his experimental Robotess Robot Helena Both are more advanced fully featured versions In secret Helena burns the formula required to create Robots The revolt of the Robots reaches Rossums island as the act ends Final scene of the ActIII Act III edit The characters sense that the very universality of the Robots presents a danger Reminiscent of the Tower of Babel the characters discuss whether creating national Robots who were unable to communicate beyond their language group would have been a good idea As Robot forces lay siege to the factory Helena reveals she has burned the formula necessary to make new robots The characters lament the end of humanity and defend their actions despite the fact that their imminent deaths are a direct result of those actions Busman is killed attempting to negotiate a peace with the Robots who then storm the factory and kill all the humans except for Alquist the companys chief engineer whom the Robots spare because they recognize that he works with his hands like the Robots 12 Epilogue edit Years have passed and almost all humans had been killed by the robot revolution except for Alquist He has been attempting to recreate the formula that Helena destroyed although as he is a mechanical engineer with insufficient knowledge of biological chemistry he has made little progress The robot government has attempted to search for surviving humans to help Alquist but they have not been able to find any Officials from the robot government approach Alquist and first order and then beg him to complete the formula even if it means he will have to kill and dissect other Robots to do so Alquist yields agreeing to kill and dissect which completes the circle of violence begun in Act Two Alquist is disgusted by it Robots Primus and Helena develop human feelings and fall in love Playing a hunch Alquist threatens to dissect Primus and then Helena each begs him to take him or herself and spare the other Alquist realizes that they are the new Adam and Eve and gives charge of the world to them Robots edit US WPA Federal Theatre Project poster for the production by the Marionette Theatre New York 1939 The Robots described in Čapeks play are not robots in the popularly understood sense of an automaton They are not mechanical devices but rather artificial biological organisms that may be mistaken for humans A comic scene at the beginning of the play shows Helena arguing with her future husband Harry Domin because she cannot believe his secretary is a robotess DOMIN Sulla let Miss Glory have a look at you HELENA stands and offers her hand Pleased to meet you It must be very hard for you out here cut off from the rest of the world SULLA I do not know the rest of the world Miss Glory Please sit down HELENA sits Where are you from SULLA From here the factory HELENA Oh you were born here SULLA Yes I was made here HELENA startled What DOMIN laughing Sulla isnt a person Miss Glory shes a robot HELENA Oh please forgive me In a limited sense they resemble more modern conceptions of manmade life forms such as the Replicants in Blade Runner the hosts in the Westworld TV series and the humanoid Cylons in the reimagined Battlestar Galactica but in Čapeks time there was no conception of modern genetic engineering DNA s role in heredity was not confirmed until 1952 There are descriptions of kneadingtroughs for robot skin great vats for liver and brains and a factory for producing bones Nerve fibers arteries and intestines are spun on factory bobbins while the Robots themselves are assembled like automobiles 13 Čapeks robots are living biological beings but they are still assembled as opposed to grown or born One critic has described Čapeks Robots as epitomizing the traumatic transformation of modern society by the First World War and the Fordist assembly line 13 Origin of the word edit The play introduced the word robot which displaced older words such as automaton or android in languages around the world In an article in Lidové noviny Karel Čapek named his brother Josef as the true inventor of the word 14 15 In Czech robota means forced labour of the kind that serfs had to perform on their masters lands and is derived from rab meaning slave 16 The name Rossum is an allusion to the Czech word rozum meaning reason wisdom intellect or common sense 8 It has been suggested that the allusion might be preserved by translating Rossum as Reason but only the MajerPorter version translates the word as Reason 17 Production history edit Cover of the first edition of the play designed by Josef Čapek Aventinum Prague 1920 The work was published in Prague by Aventinum in 1920 and premiered at the citys National Theatre on 25 January 1921 It was translated from Czech into English by Paul Selver and adapted for the English stage by Nigel Playfair in 1923 Selvers translation abridged the play and eliminated a character a robot named Damon 18 In April 1923 Basil Dean produced RUR for the Reandean Company at St Martins Theatre London 19 The American première was at the Garrick Theatre in New York City in October 1922 where it ran for 184 performances a production in which Spencer Tracy and Pat OBrien played robots in their Broadway debuts 20 It also played in Chicago and Los Angeles during 1923 21 In the late 1930s the play was staged in the US by the Federal Theatre Project s Marionette Theatre in New York In 1989 a new unabridged translation by Claudia NovackJones restored the elements of the play eliminated by Selver 18 22 Another unabridged translation was produced by Peter Majer and Cathy Porter for Methuen Drama in 1999 17 Critical reception edit Reviewing the New York production of RUR The Forum magazine described the play as thoughtprovoking and a highly original thriller 23 John Clute has lauded RUR as a play of exorbitant wit and almost demonic energy and lists the play as one of the classic titles of interwar science fiction 24 Luciano Floridi has described the play thus Philosophically rich and controversial RUR was unanimously acknowledged as a masterpiece from its first appearance and has become a classic of technologically dystopian literature 25 Jarka M Burien called RUR a theatrically effective prototypal scifi melodrama 9 On the other hand Isaac Asimov author of the Robot series of books and creator of the Three Laws of Robotics stated Capeks play is in my own opinion a terribly bad one but it is immortal for that one word It contributed the word robot not only to English but through English to all the languages in which science fiction is now written 3 In fact Asimovs Laws of Robotics are specifically and explicitly designed to prevent the kind of situation depicted in RUR since Asimovs Robots are created with a builtin total inhibition against harming human beings or disobeying them Adaptations edit On 11 February 1938 a thirtyfiveminute adaptation of a section of the play was broadcast on BBC Television the first piece of television sciencefiction ever to be broadcast 26 In 1941 BBC radio presented a radio play version 27 and in 1948 another television adaptation this time of the entire play running to ninety minutes was screened by the BBC In this
