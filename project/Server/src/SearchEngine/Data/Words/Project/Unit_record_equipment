Unit record equipment Starting at the end of the nineteenth century well before the advent of electronic computers data processing was performed using electromechanical machines called unit record equipment electric accounting machines EAM or tabulating machines 1 2 3 4 Unit record machines came to be as ubiquitous in industry and government in the first twothirds of the twentieth century as computers became in the last third They allowed large volume sophisticated dataprocessing tasks to be accomplished before electronic computers were invented and while they were still in their infancy This data processing was accomplished by processing punched cards through various unit record machines in a carefully choreographed progression 5 This progression or flow from machine to machine was often planned and documented with detailed flowcharts that used standardized symbols for documents and the various machine functions 6 All but the earliest machines had highspeed mechanical feeders to process cards at rates from around 100 to 2000 per minute sensing punched holes with mechanical electrical or later optical sensors The operation of many machines was directed by the use of a removable plugboard control panel or connection box 7 Initially all machines were manual or electromechanical The first use of an electronic component was in 1937 when a photocell was used in a Social Security billfeed machine 8 65 Electronic components were used on other machines beginning in the late 1940s IBM was the largest supplier of unit record equipment and this article largely reflects IBM

Hollerith invented the recording of data on a medium that could then be read by a machine Prior uses of machine readable media had been for lists of instructions not data to drive programmed machines such as Jacquard looms and mechanized musical instruments After some initial trials with paper tape he settled on punched cards 9 To process these punched cards sometimes referred to as Hollerith cards he invented the keypunch sorter and tabulator unit record machines 10 11 These inventions were the foundation of the data processing industry The tabulator used electromechanical relays to increment mechanical counters Holleriths method was used in the 1890 census The company he founded in 1896 the Tabulating Machine Company TMC was one of four companies that in 1911 were amalgamated in the forming of a fifth company the ComputingTabulatingRecording Company later renamed IBM Following the 1900 census a permanent Census bureau was formed The bureaus contract disputes with Hollerith led to the formation of the Census Machine Shop where James Powers and others developed new machines for part of the 1910 census processing 12 Powers left the Census Bureau in 1911 with rights to patents for the machines he developed and formed the Powers Accounting Machine Company 13 In 1927 Powers company was acquired by Remington Rand 14 In 1919 Fredrik Rosing Bull after examining Holleriths machines began developing unit record machines for his employer Bulls patents were sold in 1931 constituting the basis for Groupe Bull These companies and others manufactured and marketed a variety of generalpurpose unit record machines for creating sorting and tabulating punched cards even after the development of computers in the 1950s Punched card technology had quickly developed into a powerful tool for business dataprocessing Timeline edit Replica of Hollerith tabulating machine with sorting box circa 1890 The sorting box was an adjunct to and controlled by the tabulator The sorter an independent machine was a later development 15 1884 Herman Hollerith files a patent application titled Art of Compiling Statistics granted US Patent 395782 on January 8 1889 1886 First use

calculator with delayline memory programmed by a connection panel that was connected to a tabulator or card readerpunch The Gamma 3 had greater capacity greater speed and lower rentals than competitive products 39 461474 1952 Remington Rand 409 Calculator aka UNIVAC 60 UNIVC 120 introduced 1952 Underwood Corp acquires the American assets of PowersSamas 55 56 Hollerith machine in use at the London School of Economics in 1964 By the 1950s punched cards and unit record machines had become ubiquitous in academia industry and government The warning often printed on cards that were to be individually handled Do not fold spindle or mutilate coined by Charles A Philips became a motto for the post World War II era even though many people had no idea what spindle meant 57 With the development of computers punched cards found new uses as their principal input media Punched cards were used not only for data but for a new application computer programs see Computer programming in the punched card era Unit record machines therefore remained in computer installations in a supporting role for keypunching reproducing card decks and printing 1955 IBM produces 725 million punched cards per day 24 1957 The IBM 608 a transistor version of the 1948 IBM 604 First commercial alltransistor calculator 39 34 58 1958 The Series 50 basic accounting machines was announced 59 These were modified machines with reduced speed andor function offered for rental at reduced rates The name Series 50 relates to a similar marketing effort the Model 50 seen in the IBM 1940 product booklet 60 An alternate report identifies the modified machines as Type 5050 introduced in 1959 and notes that RemingtonRand introduced similar products 61 1959 BTM is merged with rival PowersSamas to form International Computers and Tabulators ICT 1959 The IBM 1401 internally known in IBM for a time as SPACE for Stored Program Accounting and Calculating Equipment and developed in part as a response to the Bull Gamma 3 outperforms three IBM 407s and a 604 while having a much lower rental 39 465494 That functionality combined with the availability of tape drives accelerated the decline in unit record equipment usage 62 1960 The IBM 609 Calculator an improved 608 with core memory This will be IBMs last punched card calculator 63 Many organizations were loath to alter systems that were working so production unit record installations remained in operation long after computers offered faster and more cost effective solutions Specialized uses of punched cards including toll collection microform aperture cards and punched card voting kept unit record equipment in use into the twentyfirst century Another reason was cost or availability of equipment for example in 1965 an IBM 1620 computer did not have a printer as standard equipment so it was normal in such installations to punch printed output onto cards using two cards per line if required and print these cards on an IBM 407 accounting machine and then throw the cards away 1968 International Computers and Tabulators ICT is merged with English Electric Computers forming International Computers Limited ICL 1969 The IBM System3 renting for less than 1000 a month the ancestor of IBMs midrange computer product line aka minicomputers was aimed at new customers and organizations that still used IBM 1400 series computers or unit record equipment It featured a new smaller punched card with a 96 column format Instead of the rectangular punches in the classic IBM card the new cards had tiny 1mm circular holes much like paper tape By July 1974 more than 25000 System3s had been installed 64 1971 The IBM 129 Card Data Recorder keypunch and auxiliary online card readerpunch is the last or among the last 80column card unit record product announcements other than card readers and card punches attached to computers 1975 Cardamation founded a US company that supplied punched card equipment and supplies until 2011 65 Endings edit 1976 The IBM 407 Accounting Machine was withdrawn from marketing 66 1978 IBMs Rochester plant made its last shipment of the IBM 082 084 085 087 514 and 548 machines 67 The System3 was succeeded by the System38 64 1980 The last reconditioning of an IBM 519 Document Originating Punch 68 1984 The IBM 029 Card Punch announced in 1964 was withdrawn from marketing 69 IBM closed its last punch card manufacturing plant 70 2010 A group from the Computer History Museum reported that an IBM 402 Accounting Machine and related punched card equipment was still in operation at a filter manufacturing company in Conroe Texas 71 The punched card system was still in use as of 2013 72 2011 The owner of Cardamation Robert G Swartz dies and the company perhaps the last supplier of punch card equipment ceases operation 73 74 2015 Punched cards for time clocks and some other applications were still available one supplier was the California Tab Card Company 75 As of 2018 the web site was no longer in service Punched cards edit Main article Punched card The basic unit of data storage was the punched card The IBM 80column card was introduced in 1928 The Remington Rand Card with 45 columns in each of two tiers thus 90 columns in 1930 76 PowersSamas punched cards include one with 130 columns 77 Columns on different punch cards vary from 5 to 12 punch positions The method used to store data on punched cards is vendor specific In general each column represents a single digit letter or special character Sequential card columns allocated for a specific use such as names addresses multidigit numbers etc are known as a field An employee number might occupy 5 columns hourly pay rate 3 columns hours worked in a given week 2 columns department number 3 columns project charge code 6 columns and so on Keypunching edit Main article Keypunch IBM 029 Card Punch Original data was usually punched into cards by workers often women known as keypunch operators Their work was often checked by a second operator using a verifier machine Sorting edit See also IBM 80 series Card Sorters and IBM 101 Electronic Statistical Sorting Machine IBM 082 Sorter An activity in many unit record shops was sorting card decks into the order necessary for the next processing step Sorters like the IBM 80 series Card Sorters sorted input cards into one of 13 pockets depending on the holes punched in a selected column and the sorters settings The 13th pocket was for blanks and rejects Sorting an input card deck into ascending sequence on a multiple column field such as an employee number was done by a radix sort bucket sort or a combination of the two methods Sorters were also used to separate decks of interspersed master and detail cards either by a significant hole punch or by the cards cornercut 78 More advanced functionality was available in the IBM 101 Electronic Statistical Machine which could Sort Count Accumulate totals Print summaries send calculated results counts and totals to an attached IBM 524 Duplicating Summary Punch 79 pp 56 Tabulating edit Main article Tabulating machine An IBM 407 Accounting Machine at US Armys Redstone Arsenal in 1961 Reports and summary data were generated by accounting or tabulating machines The original tabulators only counted the presence of a hole at a location on a card Simple logic like ands and ors could be done using relays Later tabulators such as those in IBMs 300 series directed by a control panel could do both addition and subtraction of selected fields to one or more counters and print each card on its own line At some signal say a following card with a different customer number totals could be printed for the just completed customer number Tabulators became complex the IBM 405 contained 55000 parts 2400 different and 75 miles of wire a Remington Rand machine circa 1941 contained 40000 parts 23 80 Calculating edit In 1931 IBM introduced the model 600 multiplying punch The ability to divide became commercially available after World War II The earliest of these calculating punches were electromechanical Later models employed vacuum tube logic Electronic modules developed for these units were used in early computers such as the IBM 650 The Bull Gamma 3 calculator could be attached to tabulating machines unlike the standalone IBM calculators 54 Further information IBM 602 Calculating Punch IBM 603

DocumentOriginating Machine Card punching operations included Gang punching producing a large number of identically punched cardsfor example for inventory tickets Reproducing reproducing a card deck in its entirety or just selected fields A payroll master card deck might be reproduced at the end of a pay period with the hours worked and net pay fields blank and ready for the next pay periods data Computer programmers who created their programs in the form of card decks reproduced them to make backups Summary punching punching new cards with details and totals from an attached tabulating machine Mark sense reading detecting electrographic lead pencil marks on ovals printed on the card and punching the corresponding data values into the card 81 Singularly or in combination these operations were provided in a variety of machines The IBM 519 DocumentOriginating Machine could perform all of the above operations The IBM 549 Ticket Converter read data from Kimball tags copying that data to punched cards Further information IBM 513 Reproducing Punch IBM 514 Reproducing Punch and IBM 519 DocumentOriginating Machine With the development of computers punched cards were also produced by computer output devices Collating edit IBM collators had two input hoppers and four output pockets These machines could merge or match card decks based on the control panels wiring as illustrated here The Remington Rand Interfiling Reproducing Punch Type 3101 was designed to merge two separate files into a single file It could also punch additional information into those cards and select desired cards 76 Collators performed operations comparable to a database join Interpreting edit See also IBM 550 Numerical Interpreter and IBM 557 Alphabetic Interpreter An interpreter would print characters equivalent to the values of columns on the card The columns to be printed could be selected and even reordered based on the machines control panel wiring Later models could print on one of several rows on the card Unlike keypunches which printed values directly above each column interpreters generally used a font that was a little wider than a column and could only print up to 60 characters per row 82 Typical models include the IBM 550 Numeric Interpreter the IBM 557 Alphabetic Interpreter and the Remington Rand Type 312 Alphabetic Interpreter 76 Transmission of punched card data edit See also IBM 1013 Card Transmission Terminal Electrical transmission of punched card data was invented in the early 1930s The device was called an Electrical Remote Control of Office Machines and was assigned to IBMInventors were Joseph C Bolt of Boston Curt I Johnson Worcester Mass assors to the Tabulating Machine Co Endicott NY The Distance Control Device received a US patent in

tabulators and many other types of unit record equipment was directed by a control panel 85 Operation of PowersSamasRemington Rand unit record equipment was directed by a connection box 86 Control panels had a rectangular array of holes called hubs which were organized into groups Wires with metal ferrules at each end were placed in the hubs to make connections The output from some card column positions might connected to a tabulating machines counter for example A shop would typically have separate control panels for each task a machine was used for Note Control panel wiring is sometimes referred to as programming however that term applies only to the control panels of calculators such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604 that specified a sequence of operations Paper handling equipment edit Main article Continuous stationery A decollator and a burster For many applications the volume of fanfold paper produced by tabulators required other machines not considered to be unit record machines to ease paper handling A decollator separated multipart fanfold paper into individual stacks of onepart fanfold and removed the carbon paper A burster separated onepart fanfold paper into individual sheets For some uses it was desirable to remove the tractorfeed holes on either side of the fanfold paper In these cases the forms edge strips were perforated and the burster removed them as well See

conceived the idea The idea was that the card catalog then in fairly general use by libraries could be adapted with advantage to certain commercial indexes Directly connected with these is one of the most important principles of all the unit record principal in business Hitherto the records of a business house had been kept each for one fixed purpose and their usefulness had been restricted by the inflexible limitations of a bound book The unit record principle made possible by the card system gave to these records a new accessibility and significance The Story of the Library Bureau Cowen
