References A edit Abstract data type ADT is a mathematical model for data types where a data type is defined by its behavior semantics from the point of view of a user of the data specifically in terms of possible values possible operations on data of this type and the behavior of these operations This contrasts with data structures which are concrete representations of data and are the point of view of an implementer not a user Abstract method is one with only a signature and no implementation body It is often used to specify that a subclass must provide an implementation of the method Abstract methods are used to specify interfaces in some computer languages 1 Abstraction In software engineering and computer science abstraction is the process of removing physical spatial or temporal details 2 or attributes in the study of objects or systems in order to more closely attend to other details of interest 3 it is also very similar in nature to the process of generalization the abstract concept objects which are created by keeping common features or attributes to various concrete objects or systems of study 3 the result of the process of abstraction Agent architecture in computer science is a blueprint for software agents and intelligent control systems depicting the arrangement of components The architectures implemented by intelligent agents are referred to as cognitive architectures 4 Agentbased model ABM is a class of computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole It combines elements of game theory complex systems emergence computational sociology multiagent systems and

calculation data processing and automated reasoning tasks Algorithm design refers to a method or mathematical process for problem solving and engineering algorithms The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of operation research such as dynamic programming and divideandconquer Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns 7 such as the template method pattern and decorator pattern Algorithmic efficiency is a property of an algorithm which relates to the number of computational resources used by the algorithm An algorithm must be analyzed to determine its resource usage and the efficiency of an algorithm can be measured based on usage of different resources Algorithmic efficiency can be thought of as analogous to

assertion is a statement that a predicate Booleanvalued function ie a truefalse expression is always true at that point in code execution It can help a programmer read the code help a compiler compile it or help the program detect its own defects For the latter some programs check assertions by actually evaluating the predicate as they run and if it is not in fact true an assertion failure the program considers itself to be broken and typically deliberately crashes or throws an assertion failure exception Associative array Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and automata as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them It is a theory in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics a subject of study in both mathematics and computer science The word automata the plural of automaton comes from the Greek word αὐτόματα which means selfacting Automated reasoning is an area of computer science and mathematical logic dedicated to understanding different aspects of reasoning The study of automated reasoning helps produce computer programs that allow computers to reason completely or nearly completely automatically Although automated

has one of two possible values usually denoted true and false intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra It is named after George Boole who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century The Boolean data type is primarily associated with conditional statements which allow different actions by changing control flow depending on whether a programmerspecified Boolean condition evaluates to true or false It is a special case of a more general logical data type see probabilistic logic logic need not always be Boolean Boolean expression is used expression in a programming language that produces a Boolean value when evaluated that is one of true or false A Boolean expression may be composed of a combination of the Boolean constants true or false Booleantyped variables Booleanvalued operators and Booleanvalued functions 33 Boolean algebra In mathematics and mathematical logic Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false usually denoted 1 and 0 respectively Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are numbers and the prime operations are addition and multiplication the main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction and denoted as the disjunction or denoted as and the negation not denoted as It is thus a formalism for describing logical relations in the same way that elementary algebra describes numeric relations Byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits representing a binary number Historically the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer 34 35 and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer

Declaration In computer programming a declaration is a language construct that specifies properties of an identifier it declares what a word identifier means 82 Declarations are most commonly used for functions variables constants and classes but can also be used for other entities such as enumerations and type definitions 82 Beyond the name the identifier itself and the kind of entity function variable etc declarations typically specify the data type for variables and constants or the type signature for functions types may also include dimensions such as for arrays A declaration is used to announce the existence of the entity to the compiler this is important in those strongly typed languages that require functions variables and constants and their types to be specified with a declaration before use and is used in forward declaration 83 The term declaration is frequently contrasted with the term definition 82 but meaning and usage varies significantly between languages Digital data in information theory and information systems is the discrete discontinuous representation of information or works Numbers and letters are commonly used representations Digital signal processing DSP is the use of digital processing such as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations The signals processed in

discrete sequence of events in time Each event occurs at a particular instant in time and marks a change of state in the system 84 Between consecutive events no change in the system is assumed to occur thus the simulation can directly jump in time from one event to the next Disk storage Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another 85 The components interact with one another

called an edge concentrator Encryption Event Is an action or occurrence recognized by software often originating asynchronously from the external environment that may be handled by the software Because an event is an entity which encapsulates the action and the contextual variables triggering the action we can use the acrostic mnemonic of an event as an E xecution V ariable E ncapsulating N amed T rigger to clarify the concept Eventdriven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions mouse clicks key presses sensor outputs or messages from other programs or threads Eventdriven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications eg JavaScript web applications that are

populationbased trial and error problem solvers with a metaheuristic or stochastic optimization character Executable executable code or an executable file or executable program sometimes simply referred to as an executable causes a computer to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions 88 as opposed to a data file that must be parsed by a program to be meaningful The exact interpretation depends upon the use while instructions is traditionally taken to mean machine code instructions for a physical CPU in some contexts a file containing bytecode or scripting language instructions may also be considered executable Exception handling is the process of responding to the occurrence during computation of exceptions anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special

specify this statement descendants of ALGOL use for while descendants of Fortran use do There are other possibilities for example COBOL which uses PERFORM VARYING Formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification development and verification of software and hardware systems 92 The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that as in other engineering disciplines performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design 93 Formal verification is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of intended algorithms underlying a system with respect to a certain formal specification or property using formal methods of mathematics 94 Functional

unit symbol for the gigabyte is GB Global variable In computer programming a global variable is a variable with global scope meaning that it is visible hence accessible throughout the program unless shadowed The set of all global variables is known as the global environment or global state In compiled languages global variables are generally static variables whose extent lifetime is the entire runtime of the program though in interpreted languages including commandline interpreters global variables are generally dynamically allocated when declared since they are not known ahead of time

tree that satisfies the heap property if P is a parent node of C then the key the value of P is either greater than or equal to in a max heap or less than or equal to in a min heap the key of C 98 The node at the top of the heap with no parents is called the root node Heapsort is a comparisonbased sorting algorithm Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort like that algorithm it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region The improvement consists of the use of a heap data structure rather than a lineartime search to find the maximum 99 Humancomputer interaction HCI researches the design and use of computer technology focused on the interfaces

Information space analysis is a deterministic method enhanced by machine intelligence for locating and assessing resources for teamcentric efforts Information visualization Inheritance In objectoriented programming inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object prototypebased inheritance or class classbased inheritance retaining similar implementation Also defined as deriving new classes sub classes from existing ones super class or base class and forming them into a hierarchy of classes Inputoutput or IO or informally io or IO is the communication between an information processing system such as a computer and the outside world possibly a human or another information processing system Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it The term can also be used as part of an action to perform IO is to perform an input or output operation Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array or list one item at a time Instruction cycle also known as the fetchdecodeexecute cycle or simply the fetchexecute cycle is the cycle which the central processing unit CPU follows from bootup until the computer has shut down in order to process instructions It is composed of three main stages the fetch stage the decode stage and the execute stage Integer is a datum of integral data type a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits bits The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers Computer hardware including virtual machines nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer Integrated development environment IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor build automation tools and a debugger Integration testing sometimes called integration and testing abbreviated IT is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group Integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements 100 It occurs after unit testing and before validation testing Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested groups them in larger aggregates applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing 101 Intellectual property IP is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect 102 103 There are many types of intellectual property and some countries recognize more than others 104 105 106 107 108 The most wellknown types are copyrights patents trademarks and trade secrets Intelligent agent Interface is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information The exchange can be between software computer hardware peripheral devices humans and combinations of these 109 Some computer hardware devices such as a touchscreen can both send and receive data through the interface while others such as a mouse or microphone may only provide an interface to send data to a given system 110 Internal documentation Computer software is said to have Internal Documentation if the notes on how and why various parts of code operate is included within the source code as comments It is often combined with meaningful variable names with the intention of providing potential future programmers a means of understanding the workings of the code This contrasts with external documentation where programmers keep their notes and explanations in a separate document Internet The Internet portmanteau of interconnected network is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite TCPIP to link devices worldwide It is a network of networks that consists of private public academic business and government networks of local to global scope linked by a broad array of electronic wireless and optical networking technologies Internet bot also known as a web robot robot or simply bot is a software application that runs automated tasks scripts over the Internet 111 Typically bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone The largest use of bots is in web spidering web crawler in which an automated script fetches analyzes and files information from web servers at many times the speed of a human Interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program Invariant Iteration J edit Java is a generalpurpose programming language that is classbased objectoriented 112 although not a pure OO language 113 and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible It is intended to let application developers write once run anywhere WORA 114 meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation 115 K edit Kernel When referring to an operating system the kernel is the first section of the operating system to load into memory As the center of the operating system the kernel needs to be small efficient and loaded into a protected area in the memory so as not to be overwritten It can be responsible for such things as disk drive management file management memory management process management etc L edit Library computing is a collection of nonvolatile resources used by computer programs often for software development These may include configuration data documentation help data message templates prewritten code and subroutines classes values or type specifications Linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched 116 Linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory Instead each element points to the next It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence Linker or link editor is a computer utility program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler or an assembler and combines them into a single executable file library file or another object file A simpler version that writes its output directly to memory is called the loader though loading is typically considered a separate process 117 List or sequence is an abstract data type that represents a countable number of ordered values where the same value may occur more than once An instance of a list is a computer representation of the mathematical concept of a finite sequence the potentially infinite analog of a list is a stream 118 35 Lists are a basic example of containers as they contain other values If the same value occurs multiple times each occurrence is considered a distinct item Loader is the part of an operating system that is responsible for loading programs and libraries It is one of the essential stages in the process of starting a program as it places programs into memory and prepares them for execution Loading a program involves reading the contents of the executable file containing the program instructions into memory and then carrying out other required preparatory tasks to prepare the executable for running Once loading is complete the operating system starts the program by passing control to the loaded program code Logic error In computer programming a logic error is a bug in a program that causes it to operate incorrectly but not to terminate abnormally or crash A logic error produces unintended or undesired output or other behaviour although it may not immediately be recognized as such Logic programming is a type of programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form expressing facts and rules about some problem domain Major logic programming language families include Prolog answer set programming ASP and Datalog M edit Machine learning ML is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions relying on patterns and inference instead It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data known as training data in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task 119 120 Machine vision MV is the technology and methods used to provide imagingbased automatic inspection and analysis for such applications as automatic inspection process control and robot guidance usually in industry Machine vision refers to many technologies software and hardware products integrated systems actions methods and expertise Machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision a form of computer science It attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems The term is the prevalent one for these functions in industrial automation environments but is also used for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics It bears close connections to metamathematics the foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science 121 The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems Matrix In mathematics a matrix plural matrices is a rectangular array 122 see irregular matrix of numbers symbols or expressions arranged in rows and columns 123 124 Memory Computer data storage often called storage is a technology consisting of computer components and recording media that are used to retain digital data It is a core function and fundamental component of computers 125 1516 Merge sort also commonly spelled mergesort is an efficient generalpurpose comparisonbased sorting algorithm Most implementations produce a stable sort which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945 126 A detailed description and analysis of bottomup mergesort appeared in a report by Goldstine and von Neumann as early as 1948 127 Method in objectoriented programming OOP is a procedure associated with a message and an object An object consists of data and behavior The data and behavior comprise an interface which specifies how the object may be utilized by any of various consumers 128 of the object Methodology In software engineering a software development process is the process of dividing software development work into distinct phases to improve design product management and project management It is also known as a software development life cycle SDLC The methodology may include the predefinition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application 129 Modem a portmanteau of modulatordemodulator is a hardware device that converts data into a format suitable for a transmission medium so that it can be transmitted from one computer to another historically along telephone wires A modem modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded reliably to reproduce the original digital data Modems can be used with almost any means of transmitting analog signals from lightemitting diodes to radio A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data N edit Natural language processing NLP is a subfield of linguistics computer science information engineering and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human natural languages in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition natural language understanding and natural language generation Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integervalued functions Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation as opposed to symbolic manipulations for the problems of mathematical analysis as distinguished from discrete mathematics Numerical method In numerical analysis a numerical method is a mathematical tool designed to solve numerical problems The implementation of a numerical method with an appropriate convergence check in a programming language is called a numerical algorithm O edit Object An object can be a variable a data structure a function or a method and as such is a value in memory referenced by an identifier In the classbased objectoriented programming paradigm object refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables functions and data structures In relational database management an object can be a table or column or an association between data and a database entity such as relating a persons age to a specific person 130 Object code or object module is the product of a compiler 131 In a general sense object code is a sequence of statements or instructions in a computer language 132 usually a machine code language ie binary or an intermediate language such as register transfer language RTL The term indicates that the code is the goal or result of the compiling process with some early sources referring to source code as a subject program Objectoriented analysis and design OOAD is a technical approach for analyzing and designing an application system or business by applying objectoriented programming as well as using visual modeling throughout the software development process to guide stakeholder communication and product quality Object oriented programming OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects which can contain data in the form of fields often known as attributes or properties and code in the form of procedures often known as methods A feature of objects is an objects procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated objects have a notion of this or self In OOP computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another 133 134 OOP languages are diverse but the most popular ones are classbased meaning that objects are instances of classes which also determine their types Opensource software OSS is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study change and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose 135 Opensource software may be developed in a collaborative public manner Opensource software is a prominent example of open collaboration 136 Operating system OS is system software that manages computer hardware software resources and provides common services for computer programs Optical fiber is a flexible transparent fiber made by drawing glass silica or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than that of a human hair 137 Optical fibers are used most often as a means to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in fiberoptic communications where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths data rates than electrical cables Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel along them with less loss in addition fibers are immune to electromagnetic interference a problem from which metal wires suffer 138 P edit Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation One the driver writes code while the other the observer or navigator 139 reviews each line of code as it is typed in The two programmers switch roles frequently Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously 140 Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones which can then be solved at the same time There are several different forms of parallel computing bitlevel instructionlevel data and task parallelism Parameter In computer programming a parameter or a formal argument is a special kind of variable used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine b These pieces of data are the values 141 142 143 of the arguments often called actual arguments or actual parameters with which the subroutine is going to be calledinvoked An ordered list of parameters is usually included in the definition of a subroutine so that each time the subroutine is called its arguments for that call are evaluated and the resulting values can be assigned to the corresponding parameters Peripheral Postcondition In computer programming a postcondition is a condition or predicate that must always be true just after the execution of some section of code or after an operation in a formal specification Postconditions are sometimes tested using assertions within the code itself Often postconditions are simply included in the documentation of the affected section of code Precondition In computer programming a precondition is a condition or predicate that must always be true just prior to the execution of some section of code or before an operation in a formal specification If a precondition is violated the effect of the section of code becomes undefined and thus may or may not carry out its intended work Security problems can arise due to incorrect preconditions Primary storage Primitive data type Priority queue Procedural programming Program lifecycle phase Programming language Programming language implementation Programming language theory Prolog Python Q edit Quantum computing is the use of quantummechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation A quantum computer is used to perform such computation which can be implemented theoretically or physically 144 I5 Queue is a collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal or only operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position known as enqueue and removal of entities from the front terminal position known as dequeue

is a storage location identified by a memory address paired with an associated symbolic name an identifier which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value in addition to referring to the variable itself depending on the context This separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of program execution 145 146 Virtual machine VM is an emulation of a computer system Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer Their implementations may involve specialized hardware software or a combination VModel In software development the Vmodel 147 represents a development process that may be considered an extension of the waterfall model and is an example of the more general Vmodel Instead of moving down in a linear way the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase to form the typical V shape The VModel demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing The horizontal and vertical axes represent time or project completeness lefttoright and level of abstraction coarsestgrain abstraction uppermost respectively W edit WAV Waveform Audio File Format Waterfall model is a breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialisation of tasks The approach is typical for certain areas of engineering design In software development it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches as progress flows in largely one direction downwards like a waterfall through the phases of conception initiation analysis design construction

number of bits transmitted in parallel to and from inputoutput units A term other than character is used here because a given character may be represented in different applications by more than one code and different codes may use different numbers of bits ie different byte sizes In inputoutput transmission the grouping of bits may be completely arbitrary and have no relation to actual characters The term is coined from bite but respelled to avoid accidental mutation to bit A word consists of the number of data bits transmitted in parallel from or to memory in one memory cycle Word
