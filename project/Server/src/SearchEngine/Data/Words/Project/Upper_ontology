science an upper ontology also known as a toplevel ontology upper model or foundation ontology is an ontology in the sense used in information science which consists of very general terms such as object property relation that are common across all domains An important function of an upper ontology is to support broad semantic interoperability among a large number of domainspecific ontologies by providing a common starting point for the formulation of definitions Terms in the domain ontology are ranked under the terms in the upper ontology eg the upper ontology classes are superclasses or supersets of all the classes in the domain ontologies A number of upper ontologies have been proposed each with its own proponents Library classification systems predate upper ontology systems Though library classifications organize and categorize knowledge using general concepts that are the same across all knowledge domains neither system is a replacement for the other Contents 1 Development 11

References Development edit Any standard foundational ontology is likely to be contested among different groups each with their own idea of what exists One factor exacerbating the failure to arrive at a common approach has been the lack of opensource applications that would permit the testing of different ontologies in the same computational environment The differences have thus been debated largely on theoretical grounds or are merely the result of personal preferences Foundational ontologies can however be compared on the basis of adoption for the purposes of supporting interoperability across domain ontologies No particular upper ontology has yet gained widespread acceptance as a de facto standard Different organizations have attempted to define standards for specific domains The Process Specification Language PSL created by the National Institute for Standards and Technology NIST is one example Another important factor leading to the absence of wide adoption of any existing upper ontology is the complexity Some upper ontologies Cyc is often cited as an example in this regardare very large ranging up to thousands of elements classes relations with complex interactions among them and with a complexity similar to that of a human natural language and the learning process can be even longer than for a natural language because of the unfamiliar format and logical rules The motivation to overcome this learning barrier is largely absent because of the paucity of publicly accessible examples of use As a result those building domain ontologies for local applications tend to create the simplest possible domainspecific ontology not related to any upper ontology Such domain ontologies may function adequately for the local purpose but they are very timeconsuming to relate accurately to other domain ontologies To solve this problem some genuinely top level ontologies have been developed which are deliberately designed to have minimal overlap with any domain

template message Historically many attempts in many societies which have been made to impose or define a single set of concepts as more primal basic foundational authoritative true or rational than all others A common objection by whom to such attempts points out that humans lack the sort of transcendent perspective or Gods eye view that would be required to achieve this goal Humans are bound by language or culture and so lack the sort of objective perspective from which to observe the whole terrain of concepts and derive any one standard Another objection is the problem of formulating definitions Top level ontologies are designed to maximize support for interoperability across a large number of terms Such ontologies must therefore consist of terms expressing very general concepts but such concepts are so basic to our understanding that there is no way in which they can be defined since the very process of definition implies that a less basic and less well understood concept is defined in terms of concepts that are more basic and so ideally more well understood Very general concepts can often only be elucidated for example by means of examples or paraphrase There is no selfevident way of dividing the world up into concepts and certainly no noncontroversial one There is no neutral ground that can serve as a means of translating between specialized or lower or applicationspecific ontologies Human language itself is already an arbitrary approximation of just one among many possible conceptual maps To draw any necessary correlation between English words and any number of intellectual concepts we might like to represent in our ontologies is just asking for trouble WordNet for instance is successful and useful precisely because it does not pretend to be a generalpurpose upper ontology rather it is a tool for semantic syntactic linguistic disambiguation which is richly embedded in the particulars and peculiarities of the English language Any hierarchical or topological representation of concepts must begin from some ontological epistemological linguistic cultural and ultimately pragmatic perspective Such pragmatism does not allow for the exclusion of politics between persons or groups indeed it requires they be considered as perhaps more basic primitives than any that are represented Those who who doubt the feasibility of general purpose ontologies are more inclined to ask what specific purpose do we have in mind for this conceptual map of entities and what practical difference will this ontology make This pragmatic philosophical position surrenders all hope of devising the encoded ontology version of everything that is the case Wittgenstein Tractatus LogicoPhilosophicus Finally there are objections similar to those against artificial intelligence from whom Technically the complex concept acquisition and the social linguistic interactions of human beings suggests any axiomatic foundation of most basic concepts must be cognitive biological or otherwise difficult to characterize since we dont have axioms for such systems Ethically any generalpurpose ontology could quickly become an actual tyranny by recruiting adherents into a political program designed to propagate it and its funding means and possibly defend it by violence Historically inconsistent and irrational belief systems have proven capable of commanding obedience to the detriment or harm of persons both inside and outside a society that accepts them How much more harmful would a consistent rational one be were it to contain even one or two basic assumptions incompatible with human life Arguments for the feasibility of an upper ontology edit This section does not cite any sources Please help improve this section by adding

message Many of those who doubt the possibility of developing wide agreement on a common upper ontology fall into one of two traps they assert that there is no possibility of universal agreement on any conceptual scheme but they argue that a practical common ontology does not need to have universal agreement it only needs a large enough user community as is the case for human languages to make it profitable for developers to use it as a means to general interoperability and for thirdparty developer to develop utilities to make it easier to use and they point out that developers of data schemes find different representations congenial for their local purposes but they do not demonstrate that these different representation are in fact logically inconsistent In fact different representations of assertions about the real world though not philosophical models if they accurately reflect the world must be logically consistent even if they focus on different aspects of the same physical object or phenomenon If any two assertions about the real world are logically inconsistent one or both must be wrong and that is a topic for experimental investigation not for ontological representation In practice representations of the real world are created as and known to be approximations to the basic reality and their use is circumscribed by the limits of error of measurements in any given practical application Ontologies are entirely capable of representing approximations and are also capable of representing situations in which different approximations have different utility Objections based on the different ways people perceive things attack a simplistic impoverished view of ontology The objection that there are logically incompatible models of the world are true but in an upper ontology those different models can be represented as different theories and the adherents of those theories can use them in preference to other theories while preserving the logical consistency of the necessary assumptions of the upper ontology The necessary assumptions provide the logical vocabulary with which to specify the meanings of all of the incompatible models It has never been demonstrated that incompatible models cannot be properly specified with a common more basic set of concepts while there are examples of incompatible theories that can be logically specified with only a few basic concepts Many of the objections to upper ontology refer to the problems of lifecritical decisions or nonaxiomatized problem areas such as law or medicine or politics that are difficult even for humans to understand Some of these objections do not apply to physical objects or standard abstractions that are defined into existence by human beings and closely controlled by them for mutual good such as standards for electrical power system connections or the signals used in traffic lights No single general metaphysics is required to agree that some such standards are desirable For instance while time and space can be represented many ways some of these are already used in interoperable artifacts like maps or schedules Objections to the feasibility of a common upper ontology also do not take into account the possibility of forging agreement on an ontology that contains all of the primitive ontology elements that can be combined to create any number of more specialized concept representations Adopting this tactic permits effort to be focused on agreement only on a limited number of ontology elements By agreeing on the meanings of that inventory of basic concepts it becomes possible to create and then accurately and automatically interpret an infinite number of concept representations as combinations of the basic ontology elements Any domain ontology or database that uses the elements of such an upper ontology to specify the meanings of its terms will be automatically and accurately interoperable with other ontologies that use the upper ontology even though they may each separately define a large number of domain elements not defined in other ontologies In such a case proper interpretation will require that the logical descriptions of domainspecific elements be transmitted along with any data that is communicated the data will then be automatically interpretable because the domain element descriptions based on the upper ontology will be properly interpretable by any system that can properly use the upper ontology In effect elements in different domain ontologies can be translated into each other using the common upper ontology An upper ontology based on such a set of primitive elements can include alternative views provided that they are logically compatible Logically incompatible models can be represented as alternative theories or represented in a specialized extension to the upper ontology The proper use of alternative theories is a piece of knowledge that can itself be represented in an ontology Users that develop new domain ontologies and find that there are semantic primitives needed for their domain but missing from the existing common upper ontology can add those new primitives by the accepted procedure expanding the common upper ontology as necessary Most proponents who of an upper ontology argue that several good ones may be created with perhaps different emphasis Very few are actually arguing to discover just one within natural language or even an academic field Most are simply standardizing some existing communication Another view advanced is that there is almost total overlap of the different ways that upper ontologies have been formalized in the sense that different ontologies focus on a different aspect of the same entities but the different views are complementary and not contradictory to each other as a result an internally consistent ontology that contains all the views with means of translating the different views into the other is feasible Such an ontology has not thus far been constructed however because it would require a large project to develop so as to include all of the alternative views in the separately developed upper ontologies along with their translations The main barrier to construction of such an ontology is not the technical issues but the reluctance of funding agencies to provide the funds for a large enough consortium of developers and users Several common arguments against upper ontology can be examined more clearly by separating issues of concept definition ontology language lexicons and facts knowledge For instance people have different terms and phrases for the same concept However that does not necessarily mean that those people are referring to different concepts They may simply be using different language or idiom Formal ontologies typically use linguistic labels to refer to concepts but the terms that label ontology elements mean no more and no less than what their axioms say they mean Labels are similar to variable names in software evocative rather than definitive The proponents of a common upper ontology point out that the meanings of the elements classes relations rules in an ontology depend only on their logical form and not on the labels which are usually chosen merely to make the ontologies more easily usable by their human developers In fact the labels for elements in an ontology need not be words they could be for example images of instances of a particular type or videos of an action that is represented by a particular type It cannot be emphasized too strongly that words are not what are represented in an ontology but entities in the real world or abstract entities concepts in the minds of people Words are not equivalent to ontology elements but words label ontology elements There can be many words that label a single concept even in a single language synonymy and there can be many concepts labeled by a single word ambiguity Creating the mappings between human language and the elements of an ontology is the province of Natural Language Understanding But the ontology itself stands independently as a logical and computational structure For this reason finding agreement on the structure of an ontology is actually easier than developing a controlled vocabulary because all different interpretations of a word can be included each mapped to the same word in the different terminologies A second argument is that people believe different things and therefore cant have the same ontology However people can assign different truth values to a particular assertion while accepting the validity of certain underlying claims facts or way of expressing an argument with which they disagree Using for instance the issuepositionargument form This objection to upper ontologies ignores the fact that a single ontology can represent different belief systems representing them as different belief systems without taking a position on the validity of either Even arguments about the existence of a thing require a certain sharing of a concept even though its existence in the real world may be disputed Separating belief from naming and definition also helps to clarify this issue and show how concepts can be held in common even in the face of differing belief For instance wiki as a medium may permit such confusion but disciplined users can apply dispute resolution methods to sort out their conflicts It is also argued that most people share a common set of semantic primitives fundamental concepts to which they refer when they are trying to explain unfamiliar terms to other people An ontology that includes representations of those semantic primitives could in such a case be used to create logical descriptions of any term that a person may wish to define logically That ontology would be one form of upper ontology serving as a logical interlingua that can translate ideas in one terminology to its logical equivalent in another terminology Advocates who argue that most disagreement about the viability of an upper ontology can be traced to the conflation of ontology language and knowledge or toospecialized areas of knowledge many people or agents or groups will have areas of their respective internal ontologies that do not overlap If they can cooperate and share a conceptual map at all this may be so very useful that it outweighs any disadvantages that accrue from sharing To the degree it becomes harder to share concepts the deeper one probes the more valuable such sharing tends to get If the problem is as basic as opponents of upper ontologies claim then it also applies to a group of humans trying to cooperate who might need machine assistance to communicate easily If nothing else such ontologies are implied by machine translation used when people cannot practically communicate Whether upper or not these seem likely to proliferate Table of formal upper ontologies edit Table contains data mainly from 1 Please expand

Ontology The Basic Formal Ontology BFO framework developed by Barry Smith and his associates consists of a series of subontologies at different levels of granularity The ontologies are divided into two varieties relating to continuant entities such as threedimensional enduring objects and occurrent entities primarily processes conceived as unfolding in successive phases through time BFO thus incorporates both threedimensionalist and fourdimensionalist perspectives on reality within a single framework Interrelations are defined between the two types of ontologies in a way which gives BFO the facility to deal with both staticspatial and dynamictemporal features of reality A continuant domain ontology descending from BFO can be conceived as an inventory of entities existing at a time Each occurrent ontology can be conceived as an inventory of processes unfolding through a given interval of time Both BFO itself and each of its extension subontologies can be conceived as a window on a certain portion of reality at a given level of granularity More than 200 extension ontologies 10 of BFO have been created applying the BFO architecture to different domains through the strategy of downward population The Cell Ontology for example populates downward from BFO by importing the BFO branch terminating with object and defining a cell as a subkind of object Other examples of ontologies extending BFO are the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations OBI and the ontologies of the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry In addition to these examples BFO and extensions are increasingly being use in defense and security domains for example in the AIRS framework 11 BFO serves as the upper level of the Sustainable Development Goals SDG Interface Ontology developed by the United Nations Environment Programme 12 BFO has been documented in the textbook Building Ontologies with Basic Formal Ontology 13 published by MIT Press in 2015 BORO edit Main article BORO Business Objects Reference Ontology is an upper ontology designed for developing ontological or semantic models for large complex operational applications that consists of a top ontology as well as a process for constructing the ontology It is built upon a series of clear metaphysical choices to provide a solid metaphysical foundation A key choice was for an extensional and hence fourdimensional ontology which provides it a simple criteria of identity Elements of it have appeared in a number of standards For example the ISO standard ISO 15926 Industrial automation systems and integration was heavily influenced by an early version The IDEAS International Defence Enterprise Architecture Specification for exchange standard is based upon BORO which in turn was used to develop DODAF 20 CIDOC

taxonomy Coordinating Working Group with the goal of developing a foundation ontology that can serve to enable broad general Semantic Interoperability The current version is an OWL ontology but a CommonLogic compliant version is anticipated in the future The ontology and explanatory files are available at the COSMO site The goal of the COSMO working group was to develop a foundation ontology by a collaborative process that will allow it to represent all of the basic ontology elements that all members feel are needed for their applications The development of COSMO is fully open and any comments or suggestions from any sources are welcome After some discussion and input from members in 2006 the development of the COSMO has been continued primarily by Patrick Cassidy the chairman of the COSMO Working Group Contributions and suggestions from any interested party are still welcome and encouraged Many of the types OWL classes in the current COSMO have been taken from the OpenCyc OWL version 078 and from the SUMO Other elements were taken from other ontologies such as BFO and DOLCE or developed specifically for COSMO Development of the COSMO initially focused on including representations of all of the words in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE controlled defining vocabulary 2148 words These words are sufficient to define linguistically all of the entries in the LDOCE It is hypothesized that the ontological representations of the concepts represented by those terms will be sufficient to specify the meanings of any specialized ontology element thereby serving as a basis for general Semantic Interoperability Interoperability via COSMO is enabled by using the COSMO or an ontology derived from it as an interlingua by which other domain ontologies can be translated into each others terms and thereby accurately communicate As new domains are linked into COSMO additional semantic primitives may be recognized and added to its structure The current January 2016 OWL version of COSMO has over 8000 types OWL classes over 1000 relations and over 3000 restrictions The COSMO itself COSMOowl and other related and explanatory files can be obtained at the link for COSMO in the External Links section below Cyc edit Main article Cyc A wellknown and quite comprehensive ontology available today is Cyc a proprietary system under development since 1986 consisting of a foundation ontology and several domainspecific ontologies called microtheories A subset of that ontology has been released for free under the name OpenCyc and a more or less unabridged version is made available for free noncommercial use under the name ResearchCyc DOLCE edit Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering DOLCE is the first module of the WonderWeb foundational ontologies library 16 developed by Nicola Guarino and his associates at the Laboratory for Applied Ontology LOA As implied by its acronym DOLCE is oriented toward capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human common sense DOLCE however does not commit to a strictly referentialist metaphysics related to the intrinsic nature of the world Rather the categories it introduces are thought of as cognitive artifacts which are ultimately depending on human perception cultural imprints and social conventions In this sense they intend to be just descriptive vs prescriptive notions that assist in making already formed conceptualizations explicit General Formal Ontology GFO edit Main article General formal ontology The general formal ontology GFO developed by Heinrich Herre and his colleagues of the research group OntoMed in Leipzig is a realistic ontology integrating processes and objects It attempts to include many aspects of recent philosophy which is reflected both in its taxonomic tree and its axiomatizations GFO allows for different axiomatizations of its categories such as the existence of atomic timeintervals vs dense time The basic principles of GFO are published in the OntoMed Report Nr 8 and in General Formal Ontology GFO A Foundational Ontology for Conceptual Modelling 17 18 Two GFO specialties among others are its account of persistence and its time model Regarding persistence the distinction between endurants objects and perdurants processes is made explicit within GFO by the introduction of a special category a persistent 19 A persistant is a special category with the intention that its instances remain identical over time With respect to time time intervals are taken as primitive in GFO and timepoints called time boundaries as derived Moreover timepoints may coincide which is convenient for modelling instantaneous changes gist edit gist is developed and supported by Semantic Arts gist not an acronym it means to get the essence of is a minimalist upper ontology gist is targeted at enterprise information systems although it has been applied to healthcare delivery applications The major attributes of gist are it is small there are 140 classes and 127 properties it is comprehensive most enterprises will not find the need to create additional primitive classes but will find that most of their classes can be defined and derived from gist it is robust all the classes descend from 12 primitive classes which are mostly mutually disjoint This aids a great deal in subsequent error detection There are 1342 axioms and it uses almost all of the DL constructs it is SROIQD it is concrete most upper ontologies start with abstract philosophical concepts that users must commit to in order to use the ontology Gist starts with concrete classes that most people already do or reasonably could agree with such as Person Organization Document Time UnitOfMeasure and the like it is unambiguous ambiguous terms such as term have been removed as they are often overloaded and confused Also terms that frequently have different definitions at different enterprises such as customer and order have been removed also to reduce ambiguity it is understandable in addition to being built on concrete generally understood primitives it is extremely modular The 140 classes are implemented in 18 modular ontologies each can easily be understood in its entirety and each imports only the other modules that it needs gist has been used to build Enterprise Ontologies for a number of major

paper describing the OQuaRE methodology for evaluating ontologies the gist unit of measure ontology scored the highest in the manual evaluation against 10 other unit of measure ontologies and scored above average in the automated evaluation The authors stated This ontology could easily be tested and validated its knowledge could be effectively reused and adapted for different specified

Structured Dynamics UFO Unified Foundational Ontology edit The Unified Foundational Ontology UFO developed by Giancarlo Guizzardi and associates incorporating developments from GFO DOLCE and the Ontology of Universals underlying OntoClean in a single coherent foundational ontology The core categories of UFO UFOA have been completely formally characterized in Giancarlo Guizzardis PhD thesis and further extended at the Ontology and Conceptual Modelling Research Group NEMO in Brazil with cooperators from Brandenburg University of Technology Gerd Wagner and Laboratory for Applied Ontology LOA UFOA has been employed to analyze structural conceptual modeling constructs such as object types and taxonomic relations associations and relations between associations roles properties datatypes and weak entities and parthood relations among objects More recent developments incorporate an ontology of events in UFO UFOB as well as an ontology of social and intentional aspects UFOC The combination of UFOA B and C has been used to analyze redesign and integrate reference conceptual models in a number of complex domains such as for instance Enterprise Modeling Software Engineering
