Military simulation For the civilian recreation genre see MilSim For professional wargames used by military see military wargaming Soldiers from Britains Royal Artillery train in a virtual world during Exercise Steel Sabre 2015 Military simulations also known informally as war games are simulations in which theories of warfare can be tested and refined without the need for actual hostilities Military simulations are seen as a useful way to develop tactical strategical and doctrinal solutions but critics argue that the conclusions drawn from such models are inherently flawed due to the approximate nature of the models used Many professional analysts object to the term wargames as this is generally taken to be referring to the civilian hobby thus the preference for the term simulation Simulations exist in many different forms with varying degrees of realism In recent times the scope of simulations has widened to include not only military but also political and social factors which are seen as inextricably entwined in a realistic warfare model Whilst many governments make use of simulation both individually and collaboratively little is known about it outside professional circles Yet modelling is often the means by which governments test and refine their military and political policies Contents 1 The simulation spectrum 2 Heuristic or stochastic 3 Politicalmilitary simulations 4 Simulation and reality 41 Validation 42 Problems of simulation 5 See also 6 Notes and references 7 Further reading The simulation spectrum edit Military simulations range from field exercises through computer simulations to analytical models the realism of live manoeuvres is countered by the economy of abstract simulations 1 The term military simulation can cover a wide spectrum of activities ranging from fullscale fieldexercises 2 to abstract computerized models that can proceed with little or no human involvementsuch as the Rand Strategy Assessment Center RSAC 3 As a general scientific principle the most reliable data comes from actual observation and the most reliable theories depend on it 4 This also holds true in military analysis where analysts look towards live fieldexercises and trials as providing data likely to be realistic depending on the realism of the exercise and verifiable it has been gathered by actual observation One can readily discover for example how long it takes to construct a pontoon bridge under given conditions with given manpower and this data can then generate norms for expected performance under similar conditions in the future or serve to refine the bridgebuilding process Any form of training can be regarded as a simulation in the strictest sense of the word inasmuch as it simulates an operational environment however many if not most exercises take place not to test new ideas or models but to provide the participants with the skills to operate within existing ones Fullscale military exercises or even smallerscale ones are not always feasible or even desirable Availability of resources including money is a significant factorit costs a lot to release troops and materiel from any standing commitments to transport them to a suitable location and then to cover additional expenses such as petroleum oil and lubricants POL usage equipment maintenance supplies and consumables replenishment and other items 5 In addition certain warfare models do not lend themselves to verification using this realistic method It might for example prove counterproductive to accurately test an attrition scenario by killing ones own troops Moving away from the field exercise it is often more convenient to test a theory by reducing the level of personnel involvement Map exercises can be conducted involving senior officers and planners but without the need to physically move around any troops These retain some human input and thus can still reflect to some extent the human imponderables that make warfare so challenging to model with the advantage of reduced costs and increased accessibility A map exercise can also be conducted with far less forward planning than a fullscale deployment making it an attractive option for more minor simulations that would not merit anything larger as well as for very major operations where cost or secrecy is an issue This was true in the planning of OPERATION AI Increasing the level of abstraction still further simulation moves towards an environment readily recognised by civilian wargamers This type of simulation can be manual implying no or very little computer involvement computerassisted or fully computerised Graf Helmuth von Moltke is nowadays regarded as the grandfather of modern military simulation Although not the inventor of Kriegsspiel he was greatly impressed by it as a young officer and as Chief of Staff of the Prussian Army promoted its use as a training aid Manual simulations have probably been in use in some form since mankind first went to war Chess can be regarded as a form of military simulation although its precise origins are debated 6 In more recent times the forerunner of modern simulations was the Prussian game Kriegsspiel which appeared around 1811 and is sometimes credited with the Prussian victory in the FrancoPrussian War 7 It was distributed to each Prussian regiment and they were ordered to play it regularly prompting a visiting German officer to declare in 1824 Its not a game at all Its training for war 8 Eventually so many rules sprang up as each regiment improvised their own variations two versions came into use One known as rigid Kriegsspiel was played by strict adherence to the lengthy rule book The other free Kriegsspiel was governed by the decisions of human umpires 9 Each version had its advantages and disadvantages rigid Kriegsspiel contained rules covering most situations and the rules were derived from historical battles where those same situations had occurred making the simulation verifiable and rooted in observable data which some later American models discarded However its prescriptive nature acted against any impulse of the participants towards free and creative thinking Conversely free Kriegsspiel could encourage this type of thinking as its rules were open to interpretation by umpires and could be adapted during operation This very interpretation though tended to negate the verifiable nature of the simulation as different umpires might well adjudge the same situation in different ways especially where there was a lack of historical precedent In addition it allowed umpires to weight the outcome consciously or otherwise The above arguments are still cogent in the modern computerheavy military simulation environment There remains a recognised place for umpires as arbiters of a simulation hence the persistence of manual simulations in war colleges throughout the world Both computerassisted and entirely computerised simulations are common as well with each being used as required by circumstances The Rand Corporation is one of the best known designers of Military Simulations for the US Government and Air Force and one of the pioneers of the PoliticalMilitary simulation 10 Their SAFE Strategic And Force Evaluation simulation is an example of a manual simulation with one or more teams of up to ten participants being sequestered in separate rooms and their moves being overseen by an independent director and his staff Such simulations may be conducted over a few days thus requiring commitment from the participants an initial scenario for example a conflict breaking out in the Persian Gulf is presented to the players with appropriate historical political and military background information They then have a set amount of time to discuss and formulate a strategy with input from the directorsumpires 11 often called Control as required Where more than one team is participating teams may be divided on partisan linestraditionally Blue and Red are used as designations with Blue representing the home nation and Red the opposition In this case the teams will work against each other their moves and countermoves being relayed to their opponents by Control who will also adjudicate on the results of such moves At set intervals Control will declare a change in the scenario usually of a period of days or weeks and present the evolving situation to the teams based on their reading of how it might develop as a result of the moves made For example Blue Team might decide to respond to the Gulf conflict by moving a carrier battle group into the area whilst simultaneously using diplomatic channels to avert hostilities Red Team on the other hand might decide to offer military aid to one side or another perhaps seeing an opportunity to gain influence in the region and counter Blues initiatives At this point Control could declare a week has now passed and present an updated scenario to the players possibly the situation has deteriorated further and Blue must now decide if they wish to pursue the military option or alternatively tensions might have eased and the onus now lies on Red as to whether to escalate by providing more direct aid to their clients 12 Computerassisted simulations are really just a development of the manual simulation and again there are different variants on the theme Sometimes the computer assistance will be nothing more than a database to help umpires keep track of information during a manual simulation At other times one or other of the teams might be replaced by a computersimulated opponent known as an agent or automaton 13 This can reduce the umpires role to interpreter of the data produced by the agent or remove the need for an umpire altogether Most commercial wargames designed to run on computers such as Blitzkrieg the Total War series Civilization games and even Arma 2 fall into this category Where agents replace both human teams the simulation can become fully computerised and can with minimal supervision run by itself The main advantage of this is the ready accessibility of the simulationbeyond the time required to program and update the computer models no special requirements are necessary A fully computerised simulation can run at virtually any time and in almost any location the only equipment needed being a laptop computer There is no need to juggle schedules to suit busy participants acquire suitable facilities and arrange for their use or obtain security clearances An additional important advantage is the ability to perform many hundreds or even thousands of iterations in the time that it would take a manual simulation to run once This means statistical information can be gleaned from such a model outcomes can be quoted in terms of probabilities and plans developed accordingly Removing the human element entirely means the results of the simulation are only as good as the model itself Validation thus becomes extremely significantdata must be correct and must be handled correctly by the model the modellers assumptions rules must adequately reflect reality or the results will be nonsense Various mathematical formulae have been devised over the years to attempt to predict everything from the effect of casualties on morale to the speed of movement of an army in difficult terrain One of the best known is the Lanchester Square Law formulated by the British engineer Frederick Lanchester in 1914 He expressed the fighting strength of a then modern force as proportional to the square of its numerical strength multiplied by the fighting value of its individual units 14 The Lanchester Law is often known as the attrition model as it can be applied to show the balance between opposing forces as one side or the other loses numerical strength 15 Heuristic or stochastic edit Another method of categorising military simulations is to divide them into two broad areas Heuristic simulations are those that are run with the intention of stimulating research and problem solving they are not necessarily expected to provide empirical solutions Stochastic simulations are those that involve at least to some extent an element of chance Most military simulations fall somewhere in between these two definitions although manual simulations lend themselves more to the heuristic approach and computerised ones to the stochastic Manual simulations as described above are often run to explore a what if scenario and take place as much to provide the participants with some insight into decisionmaking processes and crisis management as to provide concrete conclusions Indeed such simulations do not even require a conclusion once a set number of moves has been made and the time allotted has run out the scenario will finish regardless of whether the original situation has been resolved or not Computerised simulations can readily incorporate chance in the form of some sort of randomised element and can be run many times to provide outcomes in terms of probabilities In such situations it sometimes happens that the unusual results are of more interest than the expected ones For example if a simulation modelling an invasion of nation A by nation B was put through one hundred iterations to determine the likely depth of penetration into As territory by Bs forces after four weeks an average result could be calculated Examining those results it might be found that the average penetration was around fifty kilometreshowever there would also be outlying results on the ends of the probability curve At one end it could be that the FEBA is found to have hardly moved at all at the other penetration could be hundreds of kilometres instead of tens The analyst would then examine these outliers to determine why this was the case In the first instance it might be found that the computer models random number generator had delivered results such that As divisional artillery was much more effective than normal In the second it might be that the model generated a spell of particularly bad weather that kept As air force grounded This analysis can then be used to make recommendations perhaps to look at ways in which artillery can be made more effective or to invest in more allweather fighter and groundattack aircraft 16 Politicalmilitary simulations edit Since Carl von Clausewitz famous declaration war is merely a continuation of Politics by other means 17 military planners have attempted to integrate political goals with military goals in their planning with varying degrees of commitment Post World War II politicalmilitary simulation in the West initially almost exclusively concerned with the rise of the Soviet Union as a superpower has more recently focused on the global war on terror It became apparent in order to model an ideologically motivated enemy in general and asymmetric warfare in particular political factors had to be taken into account any realistic grand strategic simulation This differed markedly with the traditional approach to military simulations Kriegsspiel was concerned only with the movement and engagement of military forces and subsequent simulations were similarly focused in their approach Following the Prussian success in 1866 against Austria at Sadowa the Austrians French British Italians Japanese and Russians all began to make use of wargaming as a training tool The United States was relatively late to adopt the trend but by 1889 wargaming was firmly embedded in the culture of the US Navy with the Royal Navy as the projected adversary 18 Politicalmilitary simulations take a different approach to their purely military counterparts Since they are largely concerned with policy issues rather than battlefield performance they tend to be less prescriptive in their operation However various mathematical techniques have arisen in an attempt to bring rigor to the modeling process One of these techniques is known as game theory a commonlyused method is that of nonzerosum analysis in which score tables are drawn up to enable selection of a decision such that a favorable outcome is produced regardless of the opponents decision It was not until 1954 the first modern politicalmilitary simulation appeared although the Germans had modeled a Polish invasion of Germany in 1929 that could be fairly labeled politicalmilitary 19 and it was the United States that would elevate simulation to a tool of statecraft The impetus was US concern about the burgeoning nuclear arms race the Soviet Union exploded its first nuclear weapon in 1949 and by 1955 had developed their first true H bomb 20 A permanent gaming facility was created in The Pentagon and various professional analysts were brought in to run it including the social scientist Herbert Goldhamer economist Andrew Marshall and MIT professor Lincoln P Bloomfield 21 Notable US politicalmilitary simulations run since World War II include the aforementioned SAFE STRAW Str ategic A ir W ar and COW Co ld W ar 22 The typical politicalmilitary simulation is a manual or computerassisted heuristictype model and many research organizations and thinktanks throughout the world are involved in providing this service to governments During the Cold War the Rand Corporation and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology amongst others ran simulations for the Pentagon that included modeling the Vietnam War the fall of the Shah of Iran the rise of procommunist regimes in South America tensions between India Pakistan and China and various potential flashpoints in Africa and Southeast Asia 23 pageneeded Both MIT and Rand remain heavily involved in US military simulation along with institutions such as Harvard Stanford and the National Defense University Other nations have their equivalent organizations such as Cranfield Institute s Defense Academy formerly the Royal Military College of Science in the United Kingdom Participants in the Pentagon simulations were sometimes of very high rank including members of Congress and White House insiders as well as senior military officers 24 The identity of many of the participants remains secret even today It is a tradition in US simulations and those run by many other nations that participants are guaranteed anonymity The main reason for this is that occasionally they may take on a role or express an opinion that is at odds with their professional or public stance for example portraying a fundamentalist terrorist or advocating hawkish military action and thus could harm their reputation or career if their ingame persona became widely known It is also traditional that ingame roles are played by participants of an equivalent rank in real life although this is not a hardandfast rule and often disregarded 25 Whilst the major purpose of a politicalmilitary simulation is to provide insights that can be applied to realworld situations it is very difficult to point to a particular decision as arising from a certain simulationespecially as the simulations themselves are usually classified for years and even when released into the public domain are sometimes heavily censored This is not only due to the unwritten policy of nonattribution but to avoid disclosing sensitive information to a potential adversary This has been true within the simulation environment itself as well former US president Ronald Reagan was a keen visitor to simulations conducted in the 1980s but as an observer only An official explained No president should ever disclose his hand not even in a war game 26 Politicalmilitary simulations remain in widespread use today modern simulations are concerned not with a potential war between superpowers but more with international cooperation the rise of global terrorism and smaller brushfire conflicts such as those in Kosovo Bosnia Sierra Leone and the Sudan An example is the MNE M ulti n ational E xperiment series of simulations that have been run from the Atatürk Wargaming Simulation and Culture Center in Istanbul over recent years The latest MNE 4 took place in early 2006 MNE includes participants from Australia Finland Sweden and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO including Canada France Germany the United Kingdom and the United States and is designed to explore the use of diplomatic economic and military power in the global arena 27 Simulation and reality edit Ideally military simulations should be as realistic as possiblethat is designed in such a way as to provide measurable repeatable results that can be confirmed by observation of realworld events This is especially true for simulations that are stochastic in nature as they are used in a manner that is intended to produce useful predictive outcomes Any user of simulations must always bear in mind that they are however only an approximation of reality and hence only as accurate as the model itself Validation edit In the context of simulation validation is the process of testing a model by supplying it with historical data and comparing its output to the known historical result If a model can reliably reproduce known results it is considered to be validated and assumed to be capable of providing predictive outputs within a reasonable degree of uncertainty HMS Exeter at the Battle of the River Plate in 1939 As predicted by Pratts naval warfare model despite taking heavy damage the lighter British cruisers were able to defeat their much larger opponent the German battleship Admiral Graf Spee Developing realistic models has proven to be somewhat easier in naval simulations than on land 28 One of the pioneers of naval simulations Fletcher Pratt designed his Naval War Game in the late 1930s and was able to validate his model almost immediately by applying it to the encounter between the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee and three British cruisers in the Battle of the River Plate off Montevideo in 1939 Rated on thickness of armour and gun power Graf Spee should have been more than a match for the lighter cruisers but Pratts formula correctly predicted the ensuing British victory 29 In contrast many modern operations research models have proven unable to reproduce historical results when they are validated the Atlas model for instance in 1971 was shown to be incapable of achieving more than a 68 correspondence with historical results 30 Trevor Dupuy a prominent American historian and military analyst known for airing often controversial views has said that many OR analysts and planners are convinced that neither history nor data from past wars has any relevance 31 In Numbers Predictions and War he implies a model that cannot even reproduce a known outcome is little more than a whimsy with no basis in reality Historically there have even been a few rare occasions where a simulation was validated as it was being carried out One notable such occurrence was just before the famous Ardennes offensive in World War II when the Germans attacked allied forces during a period of bad weather in the winter of 1944 hoping to reach the port of Antwerp and force the Allies to sue for peace According to German General Friedrich J Fangor the staff of Fifth Panzerarmee had met in November to game defensive strategies against a simulated American attack They had no sooner begun the exercise than reports began arriving of a strong American attack in the Hűrtgen areaexactly the area they were gaming on their map table Generalfeldmarschall Walther Model ordered the participants apart from those commanders whose units were actually under attack to continue playing using the messages they were receiving from the front as game moves For the next few hours simulation and reality ran handinhand when the officers at the game table decided that the situation warranted commitment of reserves the commander of the 116th Panzer Division was able to turn from the table and issue as operational orders those moves they had just been gaming The division was mobilised in the shortest possible time and the American attack was repulsed 32 Validation is a particular issue with politicalmilitary simulations since much of the data produced is subjective One controversial doctrine that arose from early postWWII simulations was that of signallingthe idea that by making certain moves it is possible to send a message to your opponent about your intentions for example by conspicuously conducting field exercises near a disputed border a nation indicates its readiness to respond to any hostile incursions This was fine in theory and formed the basis of EastWest interaction for much of the cold war but was also problematic and dogged by criticism An instance of the doctrines shortcomings can be seen in the bombing offensives conducted by the United States during the Vietnam War US commanders decided largely as a result of their Sigma simulations to carry out a limited bombing campaign against selected industrial targets in North Vietnam The intention was to signal to the North Vietnamese high command that whilst the United States was clearly capable of destroying a much greater proportion of their infrastructure this was in the nature of a warning to scale down involvement in the South or else Unfortunately as an anonymous analyst said of the offensive which failed in its political aims they either didnt understand or did understand but didnt care 23 pageneeded It was pointed out by critics that since both Red and Blue teams in Sigma were played by Americanswith common language training thought processes and backgroundit was relatively easy for signals sent by one team to be understood by the other Those signals however did not seem to translate well across the cultural divide Problems of simulation edit Many of the criticisms directed towards military simulations derive from an incorrect application of them as a predictive and analytical tool The outcome supplied by a model relies to a greater or lesser extent on human interpretation and therefore should not be regarded as providing a gospel truth However whilst this is generally understood by most game theorists and analysts it can be tempting for a laymanfor example a politician who needs to present a black and white situation to his electorateto settle on an interpretation that supports his preconceived position Tom Clancy in his novel Red Storm Rising illustrated this problem when one of his characters attempting to persuade the Soviet Politburo that the political risks were acceptable as NATO would not be in a position to react in the face of political uncertainty caused by a division of opinion between the Allies used a political wargame result as evidence the results of a simulation carried out to model just such an event It is revealed in the text that there were in fact three sets of results from the simulation a best intermediate and worstcase outcome The advocate of war chose to present only the bestcase outcome thus distorting the results to support his case 33 A mockup of Battleship Row at Pearl Harbor This image was recreated for a later Japanese propaganda film Although fictional the above scenario may however have been based on fact The Japanese extensively wargamed their planned expansion during World War II but map exercises conducted before the Pacific War were frequently stopped short of a conclusion where Japan was defeated One oftencited example prior to Midway had the umpires magically resurrecting a Japanese carrier sunk during a map exercise although Professor Robert Rubel argues in the Naval War College Review their decision was justified in this case given improbable rolls of the dice 34 Given the historical outcome it is evident the dice rolls were not so improbable after all There were however equally illustrative fundamental problems with other areas of the simulation mainly relating to a Japanese unwillingness to consider their position should the element of surprise on which the operation depended be lost 35 Tweaking simulations to make results conform with current political or military thinking is a recurring problem In US Naval exercises in the 1980s it was informally understood no highvalue units such as aircraft carriers were allowed to be sunk 36 as naval policy at the time concentrated its tactical interest on such units The outcome of one of the largest ever NATO exercises Ocean Venture81 in which around 300 naval vessels including two carrier battle groups were adjudged to have successfully traversed the Atlantic and reached the Norwegian Sea despite the existence of a real 380strong Soviet submarine fleet as well as their simulated Red Team opposition was publicly questioned in Proceedings the professional journal of the US Naval Institute 37 The US Navy managed to get the article classified and it remains secret to this day but the articles author and chief analyst of Ocean Venture81 Lieutenant Commander Dean L Knuth has since claimed two Blue aircraft carriers were successfully attacked and sunk by Red forces 38 There have been many charges over the years of computerised models too being unrealistic and slanted towards a particular outcome Critics point to the case of military contractors seeking to sell a weapons system For obvious reasons of cost weapons systems such as an airtoair missile system for use by fighter aircraft are extensively modelled on computer Without testing of their own a potential buyer must rely to a large extent on the manufacturers own model This might well indicate a very effective system with a high kill probability Pk However it may be the model was configured to show the weapons system under ideal conditions and its actual operational effectiveness will be somewhat less than stated The US Air Force quoted their AIM9 Sidewinder missile as having a Pk of 098 it will successfully destroy 98 of targets it is fired at In operational use during the Falklands War in 1982 the British recorded its actual Pk as 078 39 Another factor that can render a model invalid is human error One notorious example was the US Air Forces Advanced Penetration Model which due to a programming error made US bombers invulnerable to enemy air defences by inadvertently altering their latitude or longitude when checking their location for a missile impact This had the effect of teleporting the bomber at the instant of impact hundreds or even thousands of miles away causing the missile to miss 40 Furthermore this error went unnoticed for a number of years 41 Other unrealistic models have had battleships consistently steaming at seventy knots twice their top speed an entire tank army halted by a border police detachment and attrition levels 50 higher than the numbers each force began with 41 Issues of enemy technical capability and military philosophy will also affect any model used Whilst a modeller with sufficiently high security clearance and access to the relevant data can expect to create a reasonably accurate picture of his own nations military capacity creating a similarly detailed picture for a potential adversary may be extremely difficult Military information from technical specifications of weapons systems to tactical doctrine is high on the list of any nations most closely guarded secrets However the difficulty of discovering the unknown when it is at least known that it exists seems trivial compared to discovering the unguessed As Len Deighton famously pointed out in Spy Story if the enemy has an unanticipated capability and he almost always does it may render tactical and strategic assumptions so much nonsense By its very nature it is not possible to predict the direction every new advance in technology will take and previously undreamtof weapons systems can come as a nasty shock to the unprepared the British introduction of the tank during World War I caused panic amongst German soldiers at Cambrai and elsewhere and the advent of Hitler s vengeance weapons such as the V1 flying bomb caused deep concern amongst Allied high command Human factors have been a constant thorn in the side of the designers of military simulations whereas politicalmilitary simulations are often required by their nature to grapple with what are referred to by modellers as squishy problems purely military models often seem to prefer to concentrate on hard numbers Whilst a warship can be regarded from the perspective of a model as a single entity with known parameters speed armour gun power and the like land warfare often depends on the actions of small groups or individual soldiers where training morale intelligence and personalities leadership come into play For this reason it is more taxing to modelthere are many variables that are difficult to formulate Commercial wargames both the tabletop and computer variety often attempt to take these factors into account in Rome Total War for example units will generally rout from the field rather than stay to fight to the last man One valid criticism of some military simulations is these nebulous human factors are often ignored partly because they are so hard to model accurately and partly because no commander likes to acknowledge men under his command may disobey him In recognition of this shortcoming military analysts have in the past turned to civilian wargames as being more rigorous or at least more realistic in their approach to warfare In the United States James F Dunnigan a prominent student of warfare and founder of the commercial tabletop wargames publisher Simulations Publications Incorporated SPI now defunct was brought into the Pentagons wargaming circle in 1980 to work with Rand and Science Applications Incorporated SAI on the development of a more realistic model 42 The result known as SAS S trategic A nalysis S imulation is still being used 43 The human factors problem was an essential element in the development of Jeremiah at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the 1980s Research by Lulejian and Associates had indicated that the individual soldiers assessment of his probability of survival was the key metric in understanding why and when combat units became ineffective While their research was based on day to day time scales the developer of Jeremiah K E Froeschner applied the principle to the 10 second time step of the computer simulation The result was a high degree of correlation with measured actions for which detailed data were available from a very few after action reports from WWII the Israeli tank action on the Golan Heights as well as live exercises conducted at Hunter liggett Military Reservation in Monterey California Jeremiah was subsequently developed into Janus by other researchers and the Jeremiah Algorithm deleted for reasons of economy Janus ran initially on a small computer and for the reasons cited abovesome in the military mostly lower ranks did not like the idea of orders not being obeyed However the Generals who witnessed Jeremiah and the algorithm in action were usually favourable and recognized the validity of the approach Lyndon Johnson and aides examining a model of Khe Sanh during the Vietnam War All the above means that models of warfare should be taken for no more than they are a nonprescriptive attempt to inform the decisionmaking process The dangers of treating military simulation as gospel are illustrated in an anecdote circulated at the end of the Vietnam War which was intensively gamed between 1964 and 1969 with even President Lyndon Johnson being photographed standing over a wargaming sand table at the time of Khe Sanh in a series of simulations codenamed Sigma 44 The period was one of great belief in the value of military simulations riding on the back of the proven success of operations research or OR during World War II and the growing power of computers in handling large amounts of data 45 The story concerned a fictional aide in Richard Nixon s administration who when Nixon took over government in 1969 fed all the data held by the US pertaining to both nations into a computer modelpopulation gross national product relative military strength manufacturing capacity numbers of tanks aircraft and the like The aide then asked the question of the model When will we win Apparently the computer replied You won in 1964 46 See also edit Military exercise Modeling and simulation Military Operations Research Society MORS Network
