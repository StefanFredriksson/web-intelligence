Early history edit The Bernoulli numbers are rooted in the early history of the computation of sums of integer powers which have been of interest to mathematicians since antiquity A page from Seki Takakazus Katsuyo Sampo 1712 tabulating binomial coefficients and Bernoulli numbers Methods to calculate the sum of the first n positive integers the sum of the squares and of the cubes of the first n positive integers were known but there were no real formulas only descriptions given entirely in words Among the great mathematicians of antiquity to consider this problem were Pythagoras c 572497BCE Greece Archimedes 287212BCE Italy Aryabhata b 476 India Abu Bakr alKaraji d 1019 Persia and Abu Ali alHasan ibn alHasan ibn alHaytham 9651039 Iraq During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries mathematicians made significant progress In the West Thomas Harriot 15601621 of England Johann Faulhaber 15801635 of Germany Pierre de Fermat 16011665 and fellow French mathematician Blaise Pascal 16231662 all played important roles Thomas Harriot seems to have been the first to derive and write formulas for sums of powers using symbolic notation but even he calculated only up to the sum of the fourth powers Johann Faulhaber gave formulas for sums of powers up to the 17th power in his 1631 Academia Algebrae far higher than anyone before him but he did not give a general formula Blaise Pascal in 1654 proved Pascals identity relating the sums of the p th powers of the first n positive integers for p 0 1 2 k The Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli 16541705 was the first to realize the existence of a single sequence of constants B 0 B 1 B 2 which provide a uniform formula for all sums of powers Knuth 1993 The joy Bernoulli experienced when he hit upon the pattern needed to compute quickly and easily the coefficients of his formula for the sum of the c th powers for any positive integer c can be seen from his comment He wrote With the help of this table it took me less than half of a quarter of an hour to find that the tenth powers of the first 1000 numbers being added together will yield the sum 91409924241424243424241924242500 Bernoullis result was published posthumously in Ars Conjectandi in 1713 Seki Kōwa independently discovered the Bernoulli numbers and his result was published a year earlier also posthumously in 1712 Selin 1997 p891 However Seki did not present his method as a formula based on a sequence of constants Bernoullis formula for sums of powers is the most useful and generalizable formulation to date The coefficients in Bernoullis formula are now called Bernoulli numbers following a suggestion of Abraham de Moivre Bernoullis formula is sometimes called Faulhabers formula after Johann Faulhaber who found remarkable ways to calculate sum of powers but never stated Bernoullis formula To call Bernoullis formula Faulhabers formula does injustice to Bernoulli and simultaneously hides the genius of Faulhaber as Faulhabers formula is in fact more efficient than Bernoullis formula According to Knuth Knuth 1993 a rigorous proof of Faulhabers formula was first published by Carl Jacobi in 1834 Jacobi 1834 Knuths indepth study of Faulhabers formula concludes the nonstandard notation on the LHS is explained further on Faulhaber never discovered the Bernoulli numbers ie he never realized that a single sequence of constants B 0 B 1 B 2

edit Jakob Bernoullis Summae Potestatum 1713 The Bernoulli numbers OEIS A164555 n OEIS A027642 n were introduced by Jakob Bernoulli in the book Ars Conjectandi published posthumously in 1713 page 97 The main formula can be seen in the second half of the corresponding facsimile The constant coefficients denoted A B C and D by Bernoulli are mapped to the notation which is now prevalent as A B 2 B B 4 C B 6 D B 8 The expression c c 1 c 2 c 3 means c c 1 c 2 c 3 the small dots are used as grouping symbols Using todays terminology these expressions are falling factorial powers c k The factorial notation k as a shortcut for 1 2 k was not introduced until 100 years later The integral symbol on the left hand side goes back to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1675 who used it as a long letter S for summa sum a The letter n on the left hand side is not an index of summation but gives the upper limit of the range of summation which is to be understood as 1 2 n Putting things together for positive

formula suggests setting B 1 1 2 when switching from the socalled archaic enumeration which uses only the even indices 2 4 6 to the modern form more on different conventions in the next paragraph Most striking in this context is the fact that the falling factorial c k 1 has for k 0 the value 1 c 1 Graham Knuth Patashnik 1989 Section 251 Thus Bernoullis formula can be written k 1 n k c k 0 c B k k c

numbers edit In some applications it is useful to be able to compute the Bernoulli numbers B 0 through B p 3 modulo p where p is a prime for example to test whether Vandivers conjecture holds for p or even just to determine whether p is an irregular prime It is not feasible to carry out such a computation using the above recursive formulae since at least a constant multiple of p 2 arithmetic operations would be required Fortunately faster methods have been developed Buhler et al 2001 which require only O p log p 2 operations see big O notation David Harvey Harvey 2010 describes an algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers by computing B n modulo p for many small primes p and then reconstructing B n via the Chinese remainder theorem Harvey writes that the asymptotic time complexity of this algorithm is O n 2 log n 2 ε and claims that this implementation is significantly faster than implementations based on other methods Using this implementation Harvey computed B n for n 10 8 Harveys implementation has been included in SageMath since version 31 Prior to that Bernd Kellner Kellner 2002 computed B n to full precision for n 10 6 in December 2002 and Oleksandr

values of the zeta function at negative integers As such they could be expected to have and do have deep arithmetical properties For example the AgohGiuga conjecture postulates that p is a prime number if and only if pB p 1 is congruent to 1 modulo p Divisibility properties of the Bernoulli numbers are related to the ideal class groups of cyclotomic fields by a theorem of Kummer and its strengthening in the HerbrandRibet theorem and to class numbers of real quadratic fields by AnkenyArtinChowla The Kummer theorems edit The Bernoulli numbers are related to Fermats Last Theorem FLT by Kummer s theorem Kummer 1850 which says If the odd prime p does not divide any of the numerators of the Bernoulli numbers B 2 B 4 B p 3 then x p y p z p 0 has no solutions in nonzero integers Prime numbers with this property are called regular primes Another classical result of Kummer Kummer 1851 are the following congruences Main article Kummers congruence Let p be an odd prime and b an even

theorem edit Main article Von StaudtClausen theorem The von StaudtClausen theorem was given by Karl Georg Christian von Staudt von Staudt 1840 and Thomas Clausen Clausen 1840 independently in 1840 The theorem states that for every n 0 B 2 n p 1 2 n 1 p displaystyle B2nsum p1mid 2nfrac 1p is an integer The sum extends over all primes p for which p 1 divides 2 n A consequence of this is that the denominator of B 2 n is given by the product of all primes p for which p 1 divides 2 n In particular these denominators are squarefree and divisible by6 Why do the odd Bernoulli numbers vanish edit The sum φ k n i 0 n i k n k 2 displaystyle varphi knsum i0nikfrac nk2 can be evaluated for negative values of the index n Doing so will show that it is an odd function for even values of k which implies that the sum has only terms of odd index This and the formula for the Bernoulli sum imply that B 2 k 1 m is 0 for m even and 2 k 1 m 1 and that the term for B 1 is cancelled by the subtraction The von StaudtClausen theorem combined with Worpitzkys representation also gives a combinatorial answer to this question valid for n 1 From the von StaudtClausen theorem it is known that for odd n 1 the number 2 B n is an integer This seems trivial if one knows beforehand that the integer in question is zero However by applying Worpitzkys representation one gets 2 B n m 0 n 1 m 2 m 1 m n 1 m 1 0
