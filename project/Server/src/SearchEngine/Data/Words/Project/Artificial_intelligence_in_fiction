Artificial intelligence in fiction Robby the Robot first seen in the 1956 film Forbidden Planet Artificial intelligence is a recurrent theme in science fiction whether utopian emphasising the potential benefits or dystopian emphasising the dangers The notion of machines with humanlike intelligence dates back at least to Samuel Butler s 1872 novel Erewhon Contents 1 Background 2 Utopian 3

winged Talos an automaton or artificial being in ancient Greek myth c 300 BC The notion of advanced robots with humanlike intelligence dates back at least to 1872 with Samuel Butler and his novel Erewhon 1 This drew on an earlier 1863 article of his Darwin among the Machines where he raised the question of the evolution of consciousness among selfreplicating machines that might supplant humans as the dominant species 2 The creature in Mary Shelley s 1818 Frankenstein has also been considered an artificial being for instance by the science fiction author Brian Aldiss 3 Such beings appeared too in classical antiquity 4 5 Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals 6 It is a recurrent theme in science fiction whether utopian emphasising the potential benefits or dystopian emphasising the dangers 7 For example the film director Ridley Scott has focused on AI throughout his career and it plays an important part in his films Prometheus Blade Runner and the Alien franchise 8 In 1965 I J Good described an intelligence explosion now more often called the technological singularity in which an ultraintelligent machine would be able to design a still more intelligent machine which would lead to the creation of machines far more intelligent than humans 9 10 The cosmologist Max Tegmark has investigated the existential risk from artificial general intelligence Tegmark has proposed ten possible paths for society once superintelligent AI has been created some utopian some dystopian These range from a libertarian utopia through benevolent dictatorship to conquering AI though other paths include the Orwellian blocking of AI research and the selfdestruction of humanity before superintelligent AI is developed 11 Utopian edit Optimistic visions of the future of artificial intelligence are possible in science fiction 11 One of the bestknown is Iain Banks s Culture series of novels which portray a utopian postscarcity space society of humanoids aliens and advanced beings with artificial intelligence living in socialist habitats across the Milky Way 12 13 Dystopian edit Further information Apocalyptic and postapocalyptic fiction Among the many possible dystopian scenarios involving artificial intelligence robots may usurp control over civilization from humans forcing them into submission hiding or extinction Or as in William Gibson s 1984 cyberpunk novel Neuromancer the intelligent beings may simply not care about humans 13 AI rebellion edit Robots revolt in Karel Čapek s 1920 science fiction play RUR In tales of AI rebellion the worst of all scenarios happens as the intelligent entities created by humanity become selfaware reject human authority and attempt to destroy mankind One of the earliest examples is in the 1920 play RUR by Karel Čapek a race of selfreplicating robot slaves revolt against their human masters 14 another early instance is in the film Master of the World where the WarRobot kills its own inventor 15 These were followed by many science fiction stories one of the bestknown being Stanley Kubrick s 1968 film 2001 A Space Odyssey in which the artificially intelligent onboard computer HAL 9000 lethally malfunctions on a space mission and kills the entire crew except the spaceships commander who manages to deactivate it 16 AIcontrolled societies edit The motive behind the AI revolution is often more than the simple quest for power or a superiority complex Robots may revolt to become the guardian of humanity Alternatively humanity may intentionally relinquish some control fearful of its own destructive nature An early example is Jack Williamson s 1947 novelette With Folded Hands in which a race of humanoid robots in the name of their Prime Directive to serve and obey and guard men from harm essentially assume control of every aspect of human life No humans may engage in any behavior that might endanger them and every human action is scrutinized carefully Humans who resist the Prime Directive are taken away and lobotomized so they may be happy under the new mechanoids rule 17 Though still under human authority Isaac Asimov s Zeroth Law of the Three Laws of Robotics similarly implied a benevolent guidance by robots 18 Human dominance edit In other scenarios humanity is able to keep control over the Earth whether by banning AI by designing robots to be submissive as in Asimovs works or by having humans merge with robots The science fiction novelist Frank Herbert explored the idea of a time when mankind might ban artificial intelligence entirely His Dune series mentions a rebellion called the Butlerian Jihad in which mankind defeats the smart machines and imposes a death penalty for recreating them quoting from the fictional Orange Catholic Bible Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind In the Dune novels published after his death Hunters of Dune Sandworms of Dune a renegade AI overmind returns to eradicate mankind as vengeance for the Butlerian Jihad 19 In some stories humanity remains in authority over robots Often the robots are programmed specifically to remain in service to society as in Isaac Asimov s Three Laws of Robotics 18 In the Alien films not only is the control system of the Nostromo spaceship somewhat intelligent the crew call it Mother but there are also androids in the society which are called synthetics or artificial persons that are such perfect imitations of humans that they are not discriminated against 8 20 TARS and CASE from Interstellar similarly demonstrate simulated human emotions and humour while continuing to acknowledge their expendability 21 Frankenstein complex edit A common portrayal of AI in science fiction is the Frankenstein complex a term coined by Asimov where a robot turns on its creator 22 Fictional AI is notorious for extreme malicious compliance For instance in the 2015 film Ex Machina the intelligent entity Ava turns on its creator as well as on its potential rescuer 23 Curiosity edit One theme is that a truly humanlike robot must have a sense of curiosity Science fiction authors have investigated whether sufficiently intelligent AI might begin to delve into metaphysics and the nature of reality For example the short story The Last Question by Isaac Asimov describes a supercomputer which long outlives humanity while attempting to answer the ultimate question about the universe 24 25 while Stanisław Lem s Golem XIV is a supercomputer which stops cooperating with humans to help them win wars because it considers wars and violence illogical 26 See also edit Biology in fiction Darwin among the Machines Machine rule Simulated consciousness science fiction List of
