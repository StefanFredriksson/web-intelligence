OBE FRS ˈ tj ʊər ɪ ŋ 23 June 1912 7 June 1954 was an English 6 mathematician computer scientist logician cryptanalyst philosopher and theoretical biologist 7 Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine which can be considered a model of a generalpurpose computer 8 9 10 Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence 11 Despite these accomplishments he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime due to his homosexuality and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act During the Second World War Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School GCCS at Bletchley Park Britains codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence For a time he led Hut 8 the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers including improvements to the prewar Polish bombe method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements including the Battle of the Atlantic and in so doing helped win the war 12 13 Due to the problems of counterfactual history it is hard to estimate the precise effect Ultra intelligence had on the war 14 but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14million lives 12 After the war Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine which was one of the first designs for a storedprogram computer In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester where he helped develop the Manchester computers 15 and became interested in mathematical biology He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis 1 and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the BelousovZhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 had mandated that gross indecency was a criminal offence in the UK He accepted chemical castration treatment with DES as an alternative to prison Turing died in 1954 16 days before his 42nd birthday from cyanide poisoning An inquest determined his death as a suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning In 2009 following an Internet campaign British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the appalling way he was treated Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013 The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts 16 In July 2019 the Bank of England announced that Turing would be depicted on the United Kingdoms new 50 note mwparseroutput toclimit2 toclevel1 ulmwparseroutput toclimit3 toclevel2 ulmwparseroutput toclimit4 toclevel3 ulmwparseroutput toclimit5 toclevel4

in Maida Vale London 7 while his father Julius Mathison Turing 18731947 was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service ICS at Chatrapur then in the Madras Presidency and presently in Odisha state in India 17 18 Turings father was the son of a clergyman the RevJohn Robert Turing from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet Turings mother Julius wife was Ethel Sara Turing née Stoney 18811976 7 daughter of Edward Waller Stoney chief engineer of the Madras Railways The Stoneys were a Protestant AngloIrish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare 19 Julius work with the ICS brought the family to British India where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army However both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain so they moved to Maida Vale 20 London where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912 as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth 21 22 later the Colonnade Hotel 17 23 Turing had an elder brother John the father of Sir John Dermot Turing 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets 24 Turings fathers civil service commission was still active and during Turings childhood years Turings parents travelled between Hastings in the United Kingdom 25 and India leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple At Hastings Turing stayed at Baston Lodge Upper Maze Hill St LeonardsonSea now marked with a blue plaque 26 The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012 the centenary of Turings birth 27 Very early in life Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently 28 His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927 and Turing lived there during school holidays The location is also marked with a blue plaque 29 School edit Turings parents enrolled him at St Michaels a day school at 20 Charles Road St LeonardsonSea at the age of six The headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent teachers Between January 1922 and 1926 Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex now East Sussex 30 In 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to Sherborne School a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles 97km from Southampton to Sherborne stopping overnight at an inn 31 Turing c 1928 at age 16 Turings natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics His headmaster wrote to his parents I hope he will not fall between two stools If he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist he is wasting his time at a public school 32 Despite this Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus In 1928 aged 16 Turing encountered Albert Einstein s work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einsteins questioning of Newtons laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit 33 Christopher Morcom edit At Sherborne Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom 1911 1930 who has been described as Turings first love Their relationship provided inspiration in Turings future endeavours but it was cut short by Morcoms death in February 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cows milk some years previously 34 35 36 The event caused Turing great sorrow He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom In a letter to Morcoms mother Turing wrote mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited I regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do 37 Turings relationship with Morcoms mother continued long after Morcoms death with her sending gifts to Turing and him sending letters typically on Morcoms birthdays 38 A day before the third anniversary of Morcoms death 12 February 1933 he wrote to Mrs Morcom I expect you will be thinking of Chris when this reaches you I shall too and this letter is just to tell you that I shall be thinking of Chris and of you tomorrow I am sure that he is as happy now as he was when he was here Your affectionate Alan 39 Some have speculated that Morcoms death was the cause of Turings atheism and materialism 40 Apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death In a later letter also written to Morcoms mother Turing wrote Personally I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately 41 University and work on computability edit After Sherborne Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at Kings College Cambridge 7 where he was awarded firstclass honours in mathematics In 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a fellow of Kings on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem 42 Unknown to the committee the theorem had already been proven in 1922 by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg 43 A blue plaque at the college was unveiled on the centenary of his birth on 23 June 2012 and is now installed at the colleges Keynes Building on Kings Parade 44 45 In 1936 Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem 46 It was published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society journal in two parts the first on 30 November and the second on 23 December 47 In this paper Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing Gödels universal arithmeticbased formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines The Entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928 Turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt Kings College Cambridge where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935 The computer room is named after him Although Turings proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus 48 Turings approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Churchs 49 It also included a notion of a Universal Machine now known as a universal Turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could Churchs lambda calculus According to the ChurchTuring thesis Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turings paper 50 To this day Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation From September 1936 to July 1938 Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University 4 in the second year as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow In addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electromechanical binary multiplier 51 In June 1938 he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton 52 his dissertation Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals 53 54 introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing where Turing machines are augmented with socalled oracles allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to the United Kingdom 55 Career and research edit When Turing returned to Cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics 56 The lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from Turing and other students from students notes 57 Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them 58 Cryptanalysis edit During the Second World War Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said You needed exceptional talent you needed genius at Bletchley and Turings was that genius 59 From September 1938 Turing had been working parttime with the Government Code and Cypher School GCCS the British codebreaking organisation He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox a senior GCCS codebreaker 60 Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem 61 The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change which they did in May 1940 Turings approach was more general using cribbased decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the Polish Bomba 62 Two cottages in the stable yard at Bletchley Park Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 before moving to Hut 8 On 4 September 1939 the day after the UK declared war on Germany Turing reported to Bletchley Park the wartime station of GCCS 63 Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war The others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 4042 Tunny dubbed Turingery and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography 64 and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions 65 which were of such value to GCCS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth A GCHQ mathematician who identified himself only as Richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to postwar cryptanalysis 66 He said the fact that the contents had been restricted shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject The papers detailed using mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible Richard said that GCHQ had now squeezed the juice out of the two papers and was happy for them to be released into the public domain Turing had a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park He was known to his colleagues as Prof and his treatise on Enigma was known as the Profs Book 67 According to historian Ronald Lewin Jack Good a cryptanalyst who worked with Turing said of his colleague In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off His bicycle had a fault the chain would come off at regular intervals Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen 68 Peter Hilton recounted his experience working with Turing in Hut 8 in his Reminiscences of Bletchley Park from A Century of Mathematics in America 69 It is a rare experience to meet an authentic genius Those of us privileged to inhabit the world of scholarship are familiar with the intellectual stimulation furnished by talented colleagues We can admire the ideas they share with us and are usually able to understand their source we may even often believe that we ourselves could have created such concepts and originated such thoughts However the experience of sharing the intellectual life of a genius is entirely different one realizes that one is in the presence of an intelligence a sensibility of such profundity and originality that one is filled with wonder and excitement Alan Turing was such a genius and those like myself who had the astonishing and unexpected opportunity created by the strange exigencies of the Second World War to be able to count Turing as colleague and friend will never forget that experience nor can we ever lose its immense benefit to us Hilton echoed similar thoughts in the Nova PBS documentary Decoding Nazi Secrets 70 While working at Bletchley Turing who was a talented longdistance runner occasionally ran the 40 miles 64km to London when he was needed for meetings 71 and he was capable of worldclass marathon standards 72 73 Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team but he was hampered by an injury His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes He was Walton Athletic Clubs best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone 74 75 76 In 1946 Turing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire OBE by King George VI for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years 77 78 Bombe edit Main article Bombe Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park 63 Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived The bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack Enigmaenciphered messages 79 A complete and working replica of a bombe now at The National Museum of Computing on Bletchley Park The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message ie rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib a fragment of probable plaintext For each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 10 19 states or 10 22 states for the fourrotor Uboat variant 80 the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically citation needed The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter which was impossible with the Enigma The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940 81 By late 1941 Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman Hugh Alexander and Stuart MilnerBarry were frustrated Building on the work of the Poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals In the summer they had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100000 tons a month however they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but had failed 82 On 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill explaining their difficulties with Turing as the first named They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces 82 As Andrew Hodges biographer of Turing later wrote This letter had an electric effect 83 Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay which read ACTION THIS DAY Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done On 18 November the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken 83 The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Ministers response but as MilnerBarry recalled All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth 84 More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war 85 Statue of Turing by Stephen Kettle at Bletchley Park commissioned by Sidney Frank built from half a million pieces of Welsh slate 86 Hut 8 and the naval Enigma edit Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself 87 In December 1939 Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services 87 88 That same night he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus a sequential statistical technique what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval Enigma though I was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken 87 For this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ban Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes 89 Later this sequential process of accumulating sufficient weight of evidence using decibans one tenth of a ban was used in Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher 90 Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 91 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton Ohio Turings reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes one for each wheel order I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way Their test of commutators can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it 92 During this trip he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices 93 He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943 During his absence Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8 although Alexander had been de facto head for some time Turing having little interest in the daytoday running of the section Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park 94 Alexander wrote of Turings contribution There should be no question in anyones mind that Turings work was the biggest factor in Hut 8s success In the early days he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe It is always difficult to say that anyone is absolutely indispensable but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8 it was Turing The pioneers work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turings contribution was never fully realised by the outside world 95 Turingery edit In July 1942 Turing devised a technique termed Turingery or jokingly Turingismus 96 for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans new Geheimschreiber secret writer machine This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park Turingery was a method of wheelbreaking ie a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunnys wheels 97 He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who under the guidance of Max Newman went on to build the Colossus computer the worlds first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the Heath Robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages 98 Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher 99 100 but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development 101 Delilah edit Following his work at Bell Labs in the US 102 Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system In the latter part of the war he moved in order to work for the Secret Services Radio Security Service later HMGCC at Hanslope Park At the park he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah 103 The machine was intended for different applications but it lacked the capability for use with longdistance radio transmissions In any case Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war Though the system worked fully with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech Delilah was not adopted for use 104 Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war Early computers and the Turing test edit Plaque 78 High Street Hampton Between 1945 and 1947 Turing lived in Hampton London 105 while he worked on the design of the ACE Automatic Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory NPL He presented a paper on 19 February 1946 which was the first detailed design of a storedprogram computer 106 Von Neumann s incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turings paper but it was much less detailed and according to John R Womersley Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division it contains a number of ideas which are Dr Turings own 107 Although ACE was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime 108 While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence It executed its first program on 10 May 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G15 The full version of Turings ACE was not built until after his death 109 According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics published by Genscher Düsseldorf there was a meeting between Turing and Konrad Zuse 110 It took place in Göttingen in 1947 The interrogation had the form of a colloquium Participants were Womersley Turing Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse Walther and Billing for more details see Herbert Bruderer Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz In 1948 Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester A year later he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory where he worked on software for one of the earliest storedprogram computersthe Manchester Mark 1 Turing wrote the first version of the Programmers Manual for this machine and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine the Ferranti Mark 1 He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death 111 During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics 112 and in Computing Machinery and Intelligence Mind October 1950 Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent The idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being 113 In the paper Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind it would be better to produce a simpler one to simulate a childs mind and then to subject it to a course of education A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer In 1948 Turing working with his former undergraduate colleague DG Champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist By 1950 the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp 114 In 1952 he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1 but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program Instead Turing ran the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard taking about half an hour per move The game was recorded 115 According to Garry Kasparov Turings program played a recognizable game of chess 116 The program lost to Turings colleague Alick Glennie although it is said that it won a game against Champernownes wifeIsabel 117 His Turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century 118 Pattern formation and mathematical biology edit When Turing was 39 years old in 1951 he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis in January 1952 He was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reactiondiffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis 119 He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions For example if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did To calculate the extent of this Turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in 1951 so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand These calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics Belousov was not aware of Turings paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 120 Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood Turings work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology 121 One of the early applications of Turings paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small 122 123 124 Further research in the area suggests that Turings work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the leftright asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest 125 In 2012 Sheth et al found that in mice removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turingtype mechanism 126 Later papers were not available until Collected Works of AMTuring was published in 1992 127 Personal life edit Part of a series on LGBT rights in the United Kingdom By location United

mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was shortlived After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage 128 Conviction for indecency edit In January 1952 Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray a 19yearold unemployed man Just before Christmas Turing was walking along Manchesters Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch On 23 January Turings house was burgled Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted and Turing reported the crime to the police During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time 129 and both men were charged with gross indecency under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 130 Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turings solicitor reserved his defence ie did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations Turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor and he entered a plea of guilty 131 The case Regina v Turing and Murray was brought to trial on 31 March 1952 132 Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation His probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal physical changes designed to reduce libido He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES a synthetic oestrogen this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form 133 fulfilling in the literal sense Turings prediction that no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who Ive not found out 134 135 Murray was given a conditional discharge 136 Turings conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GCCS in 1946 though he kept his academic job He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other European countries Turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work 137 Death edit On 8 June 1954 Turings housekeeper found him dead at the age of 41 he had died the previous day Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death 138 When his body was discovered an apple lay halfeaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide 139 it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose An inquest determined that he had committed suicide Andrew Hodges and another biographer David Leavitt have both speculated that Turing was reenacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 his favourite fairy tale Both men noted that in Leavitts words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew 140 Turings remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954 141 and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium just as his fathers had been 142 Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroners historical verdict He suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of Turings death the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to electroplate gold onto spoons The potassium cyanide was used to dissolve the gold Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room Copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison Turing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded halfeaten 143 In addition Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment which had been discontinued a year previously with good humour and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death He even set down a list of tasks that he intended to complete upon returning to his office after the holiday weekend 143 Turings mother believed that the ingestion was accidental resulting from her sons careless storage of laboratory chemicals 144 Biographer Andrew Hodges theorised that Turing arranged the delivery of the equipment in order to deliberately allow his mother plausible deniability with regard to any suicide claims 145 Turings OBE currently held in Sherborne School archives Conspiracy theorists pointed out that Turing was the cause of intense anxiety to the British authorities at the time of his death The secret services feared that communists would entrap prominent homosexuals and use them to gather intelligence Turing was still engaged in highly classified work when he was also a practising homosexual who holidayed in European countries near the Iron Curtain According to the conspiracy theory it is possible that the secret services considered him too great a security risk and assassinated one of the most brilliant minds in their employ 146 It has been suggested that Turings belief in fortunetelling may have caused his depressed mood 142 As a youth Turing had been told by a fortuneteller that he would be a genius Shortly before his death during a daytrip to St AnnesonSea with the Greenbaum family when Turing again decided to consult a fortuneteller 142 According to the Greenbaums daughter Barbara 147 But it was a lovely sunny day and Alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went Then he thought it would be a good idea to go to the Pleasure Beach at Blackpool We found a fortunetellers tent and Alan said hed like to go in so we waited around for him to come back And this sunny cheerful visage had shrunk into a pale shaking horrorstricken face Something had happened We dont know what the fortuneteller said but he obviously was deeply unhappy I think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide Government apology and pardon edit In August 2009 British programmer John GrahamCumming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for Turings prosecution as a homosexual 148 149 The petition received more than 30000 signatures 150 151 The Prime Minister Gordon Brown acknowledged the petition releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as appalling 150 152 Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we cant put the clock back his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him So on behalf of the British government and all those who live freely thanks to Alans work I am very proud to say were sorry you deserved so much better 150 153 In December 2011 William Jones and his Member of Parliament John Leech created an epetition 154 requesting that the British government pardon Turing for his conviction of gross indecency 155 We ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the conviction of gross indecency In 1952 he was convicted of gross indecency with another man and was forced to undergo socalled organotherapychemical castration Two years later he killed himself with cyanide aged just 41 Alan Turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation hed done so much to save This remains a shame on the British government and British history A pardon can go some way to healing this damage It may act as an apology to many of the other gay men not as wellknown as Alan Turing who were subjected to these laws 154 The petition gathered over 37000 signatures 154 156 and was submitted to Parliament by the Manchester MP John Leech but the request was discouraged by Justice Minister Lord McNally who said 157 A posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence He would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurdparticularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort However the law at the time required a prosecution and as such longstanding policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right ensure instead that we never again return to those times 158 John Leech the MP for Manchester Withington 200515 submitted several bills to Parliament 159 and led a highprofile campaign to secure the pardon Leech made the case in the House of Commons that Turings contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was ultimately just embarrassing that the conviction still stood 160 Leech continued to take the bill through Parliament and campaigned for several years until it was passed 161 Leech is now regularly described as the architect of Turings pardon and subsequently the Alan Turing Law which went on to secure pardons for 75000 other men and women convicted of similar crimes 162 163 At the UK premiere of a film based on Turings life The Imitation Game the producers thanked Leech for bringing the topic to public attention and securing Turings pardon 164 His campaign turned to acquiring pardons for the 75000 other men convicted of the same crime Leechs campaign gained public support from leading scientists including Stephen Hawking 165 On 26 July 2012 a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952 166 Late in the year in a letter to The Daily Telegraph the physicist Stephen Hawking and 10 other signatories including the Astronomer Royal Lord Rees President of the Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse Lady Trumpington who worked for Turing during the war and Lord Sharkey the bills sponsor called on Prime Minister David Cameron to act on the pardon request 167 The government indicated it would support the bill 168 169 170 and it passed its third reading in the Lords in October 171 At the bills second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013 Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill delaying its passage The bill was due to return to the House of Commons on 28 February 2014 172 but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons 173 the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy On 24 December 2013 Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turings conviction for gross indecency with immediate effect 174 Announcing the pardon Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort and not for his later criminal conviction 156 175 The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014 176 The Queens action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War 177 Pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent and a request has been made by the family or other interested party neither condition was met in regard to Turings conviction 178 In a letter to the Prime Minister David Cameron human rights advocate Peter Tatchell criticised the decision to single out Turing due to his fame and achievements when thousands of others convicted under the same law have not received pardons 179 Tatchell also called for a new investigation into Turings death A new inquiry is long overdue even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his deathincluding speculation that he was murdered by the security services or others I think murder by state agents is unlikely There is no known evidence pointing to any such act However it is a major failing that this possibility has never been considered or investigated 180 In September 2016 the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences in what was described as an Alan Turing law 181 182 The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom contained in the Policing and Crime Act 2017 which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts The law applies in England and Wales 183

wartime work was still subject to the Official Secrets Act recorded Three remarkable papers written just before the war on three diverse mathematical subjects show the quality of the work that might have been produced if he had settled down to work on some big problem at that critical time For his work at the Foreign Office he was awarded the OBE 8 Since 1966 the Turing Award has been given annually by the Association for Computing Machinery for technical or theoretical contributions to the computing community It is widely considered to be the computing worlds highest honour equivalent to the Nobel Prize 211 On 23 June 1998 on what would have been Turings 86th birthday his biographer Andrew Hodges unveiled an official English Heritage blue plaque at his birthplace in Warrington

and Canal Street The memorial statue depicts the father of computer science sitting on a bench at a central position in the park Turing is shown holding an apple The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text Alan Mathison Turing 19121954 and the motto Founder of Computer Science as it could appear if encoded by an Enigma machine IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ However the meaning of the coded message is disputed as the u in computer matches up with the u in ADXUO As a letter encoded by an enigma machine can not appear as itself the actual message behind the code is uncertain 218 Turing
