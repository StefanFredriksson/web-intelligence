AlphaGo AlphaGo logo AlphaGo is a computer program that plays the board game Go 1 It was developed by DeepMind Technologies 2 which was later acquired by Google AlphaGo had three far more powerful successors called AlphaGo Master AlphaGo Zero 3 and AlphaZero In October 2015 the original AlphaGo became the first computer Go program to beat a human professional Go player without handicap on a fullsized 1919 board 4 5 In March 2016 it beat Lee Sedol in a fivegame match the first time a computer Go program has beaten a 9dan professional without handicap 6 Although it lost to Lee Sedol in the fourth game Lee resigned in the final game giving a final score of 4 games to 1 in favour of AlphaGo In recognition of the victory AlphaGo was awarded an honorary 9dan by the Korea Baduk Association 7 The lead up and the challenge match with Lee Sedol were documented in a documentary film also titled AlphaGo 8 directed by Greg Kohs It was chosen by Science as one of the Breakthrough of the Year runnersup on 22 December 2016 9 At the 2017 Future of Go Summit its successor AlphaGo Master beat Ke Jie the world No1 ranked player at the time in a threegame match the even more powerful AlphaGo Zero already existed but was not yet announced After this AlphaGo was awarded professional 9dan by the Chinese Weiqi Association 10 AlphaGo and its successors use a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to find its moves based on knowledge previously learned by machine learning specifically by an artificial neural network a deep learning method by extensive training both from human and computer play 11 A neural network is trained to predict AlphaGos own move selections and also the winners games This neural net improves the strength of tree search resulting in higher quality of move selection and stronger selfplay in the next iteration After the match between AlphaGo and Ke Jie DeepMind retired AlphaGo while continuing AI research in other areas 12 Starting from a blank page with only a short training period AlphaGo Zero achieved a 1000 victory against the championdefeating AlphaGo while its successor the selftaught AlphaZero is currently perceived as the worlds top player in Go as well as possibly in chess Contents 1 History 11 Match against Fan Hui 12 Match against Lee Sedol 13 Sixty online games 14 Future of Go Summit 15 AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero 16 Teaching tool 2 Versions 3

considered much more difficult for computers to win than other games such as chess because its much larger branching factor makes it prohibitively difficult to use traditional AI methods such as alphabeta pruning tree traversal and heuristic search 4 13 Almost two decades after IBMs computer Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in the 1997 match the strongest Go programs using artificial intelligence techniques only reached about amateur 5dan level 11 and still could not beat a professional Go player without a handicap 4 5 14 In 2012 the software program Zen running on a four PC cluster beat Masaki Takemiya 9p twice at five and fourstone handicaps 15 In 2013 Crazy Stone beat Yoshio Ishida 9p at a fourstone handicap 16 According to DeepMinds David Silver the AlphaGo research project was formed around 2014 to test how well a neural network using deep learning can compete at Go 17 AlphaGo represents a significant improvement over previous Go programs In 500 games against other available Go programs including Crazy Stone and Zen 18 AlphaGo running on a single computer won all but one 19 In a similar matchup AlphaGo running on multiple computers won all 500 games played against other Go programs and 77 of games played against AlphaGo running on a single computer The distributed version in October 2015 was using 1202 CPUs and 176 GPUs 11 Match against Fan Hui edit Main article AlphaGo versus Fan Hui In October 2015 the distributed version of AlphaGo defeated the European Go champion Fan Hui 20 a 2dan out of 9 dan possible professional five to zero 5 21 This was the first time a computer Go program had beaten a professional human player on a fullsized board without handicap 22 The announcement of the news was delayed until 27 January 2016 to coincide with the publication of a paper in the journal Nature 11 describing the algorithms used 5 Match against Lee Sedol edit Main article AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol AlphaGo played South Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol ranked 9dan one of the best players at Go 14 needs update with five games taking place at the Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul South Korea on 9 10 12 13 and 15 March 2016 23 24 which were videostreamed live 25 Out of five games AlphaGo won four games and Lee won the fourth game which made him recorded as the only human player who beat AlphaGo in all of its 74 official games 26 AlphaGo ran on Googles cloud computing with its servers located in the United States 27 The match used Chinese rules with a 75point komi and each side had two hours of thinking time plus three 60second byoyomi periods 28 The version of AlphaGo playing against Lee used a similar amount of computing power as was used in the Fan Hui match 29 The Economist reported that it used 1920 CPUs and 280 GPUs 30 At the time of play Lee Sedol had the secondhighest number of Go international championship victories in the world after South Korean player Lee Changho who kept the world championship title for 16 years 31 Since there is no single official method of ranking in international Go the rankings may vary among the sources While he was ranked top sometimes some sources ranked Lee Sedol as the fourthbest player in the world at the time 32 33 AlphaGo was not specifically trained to face Lee nor was designed to compete with any specific human players The first three games were won by AlphaGo following resignations by Lee 34 35 However Lee beat AlphaGo in the fourth game winning by resignation at move 180 AlphaGo then continued to achieve a fourth win winning the fifth game by resignation 36 The prize was US1 million Since AlphaGo won four out of five and thus the series the prize will be donated to charities including UNICEF 37 Lee Sedol received 150000 for participating in all five games and an additional 20000 for his win 28 In June 2016 at a presentation held at a university in the Netherlands Aja Huang one of the Deep Mind team revealed that they had patched the logical weakness that occurred during the 4th game of the match between AlphaGo and Lee and that after move 78 which was dubbed the divine move by many professionals it would play as intended and maintain Blacks advantage Before move 78 AlphaGo was leading throughout the game but Lees move caused the programs computing powers to be diverted and confused 38 Huang explained that AlphaGos policy network of finding the most accurate move order and continuation did not precisely guide AlphaGo to make the correct continuation after move 78 since its value network did not determine Lees 78th move as being the most likely and therefore when the move was made AlphaGo could not make the right adjustment to the logical continuation 39 Sixty online games edit Main article Master software On 29 December 2016 a new account on the Tygem server named Magister shown as Magist at the servers Chinese version from South Korea began to play games with professional players It changed its account name to Master on 30 December then moved to the FoxGo server on 1 January 2017 On 4 January DeepMind confirmed that the Magister and the Master were both played by an updated version of AlphaGo called AlphaGo Master 40 41 As of 5 January 2017 AlphaGo Masters online record was 60 wins and 0 losses 42 including three victories over Gos topranked player Ke Jie 43 who had been quietly briefed in advance that Master was a version of AlphaGo 42 After losing to Master Gu Li offered a bounty of 100000 yuan US14400 to the first human player who could defeat Master 41 Master played at the pace of 10 games per day Many quickly suspected it to be an AI player due to little or no resting between games Its adversaries included many world champions such as Ke Jie Park Jeonghwan Yuta Iyama Tuo Jiaxi Mi Yuting Shi Yue Chen Yaoye Li Qincheng Gu Li Chang Hao Tang Weixing Fan Tingyu Zhou Ruiyang Jiang Weijie Chou Chunhsun Kim Jiseok Kang Dongyun Park Yeonghun and Won Seongjin national champions or world championship runnersup such as Lian Xiao Tan Xiao Meng Tailing Dang Yifei Huang Yunsong Yang Dingxin Gu Zihao Shin Jinseo Cho Hanseung and An Sungjoon All 60 games except one were fastpaced games with three 20 or 30 seconds byoyomi Master offered to extend the byoyomi to one minute when playing with Nie Weiping in consideration of his age After winning its 59th game Master revealed itself in the chatroom to be controlled by Dr Aja Huang of the DeepMind team 44 then changed its nationality to the United Kingdom After these games were completed the cofounder of Google DeepMind Demis Hassabis said in a tweet were looking forward to playing some official fulllength games later 2017 in collaboration with Go organizations and experts 40 41 Go experts were impressed by the programs performance and its nonhuman play style Ke Jie stated that After humanity spent thousands of years improving our tactics computers tell us that humans are completely wrong I would go as far as to say not a single human has touched the edge of the truth of Go 42 Future of Go Summit edit Main article Future of Go Summit Further information AlphaGo versus Ke Jie In the Future of Go Summit held in Wuzhen in May 2017 AlphaGo Master played three games with Ke Jie the world No1 ranked player as well as two games with several top Chinese professionals one pair Go game and one against a collaborating team of five human players 45 Google DeepMind offered 15 million dollar winner prizes for the threegame match between Ke Jie and Master while the losing side took 300000 dollars 46 47 48 Master won all three games against Ke Jie 49 50 after which AlphaGo was awarded professional 9dan by the Chinese Weiqi Association 10 After winning its threegame match against Ke Jie the toprated world Go player AlphaGo retired DeepMind also disbanded the team that worked on the game to focus on AI research in other areas 12 After the Summit Deepmind published 50 full length AlphaGo vs AlphaGo matches as a gift to the Go community 51 AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero edit Main articles AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero AlphaGos team published an article in the journal Nature on 19 October 2017 introducing AlphaGo Zero a version without human data and stronger than any previous humanchampiondefeating version 52 By playing games against itself AlphaGo Zero surpassed the strength of AlphaGo Lee in three days by winning 100 games to 0 reached the level of AlphaGo Master in 21 days and exceeded all the old versions in 40 days 53 In a paper released on arXiv on 5 December 2017 DeepMind claimed that it generalized AlphaGo Zeros approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm which achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess shogi and Go by defeating worldchampion programs Stockfish Elmo and 3day version of AlphaGo Zero in each case 54 Teaching tool edit On 11 December 2017 DeepMind released AlphaGo teaching tool on its website 55 to analyze winning rates of different Go openings as calculated by AlphaGo Master 56 The teaching tool collects 6000 Go openings from 230000 human games each analyzed with 10000000 simulations by AlphaGo Master Many of the openings include human move suggestions 56 Versions edit An early version of AlphaGo was tested on hardware with various numbers of CPUs and GPUs running in asynchronous or distributed

internal projects at Google including the AlphaGo match against Lee Sedol 57 58 In the Future of Go Summit in May 2017 DeepMind disclosed that the version of AlphaGo used in this Summit was AlphaGo Master 59 60 and revealed that it had measured the strength of different versions of the software AlphaGo Lee the version used against Lee could give AlphaGo Fan the version used in AlphaGo vs Fan Hui

2016 AlphaGos algorithm uses a combination of machine learning and tree search techniques combined with extensive training both from human and computer play It uses Monte Carlo tree search guided by a value network and a policy network both implemented using deep neural network technology 4 11 A limited amount of gamespecific feature detection preprocessing for example to highlight whether a move matches a nakade pattern is applied to the input before it is sent to the neural networks 11 The systems neural networks were initially bootstrapped from human gameplay expertise AlphaGo was initially trained to mimic human play by attempting to match the moves of expert players from recorded historical games using a database of around 30 million moves 20 Once it had reached a certain degree of proficiency it was trained further by being set to play large numbers of games against other instances of itself using reinforcement learning to improve its play 4 To avoid disrespectfully wasting its opponents time the program is specifically programmed to resign if its assessment of win probability falls beneath a certain threshold for the match against Lee the resignation threshold was set to 20 63 Style of play edit Toby Manning the match referee for AlphaGo vs Fan Hui has described the programs style as conservative 64 AlphaGos playing style strongly favours greater probability of winning by fewer points over lesser probability of winning by more points 17 Its strategy of maximising its probability of winning is distinct from what human players tend to do which is to maximise territorial gains and explains some of its oddlooking moves 65 It makes a lot of opening moves that have never or seldom been made by humans while avoiding many secondline opening moves that human players like to make It likes to use shoulder hits especially if the opponent is over concentrated citation needed Responses to 2016 victory edit AI community edit AlphaGos March 2016 victory was a major milestone in artificial intelligence research 66 Go had previously been regarded as a hard problem in machine learning that was expected to be out of reach for the technology of the time 66 67 68 Most experts thought a Go program as powerful as AlphaGo was at least five years away 69 some experts thought that it would take at least another decade before computers would beat Go champions 11 70 71 Most observers at the beginning of the 2016 matches expected Lee to beat AlphaGo 66 With games such as checkers that has been solved by the Chinook draughts player team chess and now Go won by computers victories at popular board games can no longer serve as major milestones for artificial intelligence in the way that they used to Deep Blue s Murray Campbell called AlphaGos victory the end of an era board games are more or less done and its time to move on 66 When compared with Deep Blue or Watson AlphaGos underlying algorithms are potentially more generalpurpose and may be evidence that the scientific community is making progress towards artificial general intelligence 17 72 Some commentators believe AlphaGos victory makes for a good opportunity for society to start preparing for the possible future impact of machines with general purpose intelligence As noted by entrepreneur Guy Suter AlphaGo only knows how to play Go and doesnt possess generalpurpose intelligence It couldnt just wake up one morning and decide it wants to learn how to use firearms 66 AI researcher Stuart Russell said that AI systems such as AlphaGo have progressed quicker and become more powerful than expected and we must therefore develop methods to ensure they remain under human control 73 Some scholars such as Stephen Hawking warned in May 2015 before the matches that some future selfimproving AI could gain actual general intelligence leading to an unexpected AI takeover other scholars disagree AI expert JeanGabriel Ganascia believes that Things like common sense may never be reproducible 74 and says I dont see why we would speak about fears On the contrary this raises hopes in many domains such as health and space exploration 73 Computer scientist Richard Sutton said I dont think people should be scared but I do think people should be paying attention 75 In China AlphaGo was a Sputnik moment which helped convince the Chinese government to prioritize and dramatically increase funding for artificial intelligence 76 In 2017 the DeepMind AlphaGo team received the inaugural IJCAI Marvin Minsky medal for Outstanding Achievements in AI AlphaGo is a wonderful achievement and a perfect example of what the Minsky Medal was initiated to recognise said Professor Michael Wooldridge Chair of the IJCAI Awards Committee What particularly impressed IJCAI was that AlphaGo achieves what it does through a brilliant combination of classic AI techniques as well as the stateoftheart machine learning techniques that DeepMind is so closely associated with Its a breathtaking demonstration of contemporary AI and we are delighted to be able to recognise it with this award 77 Go community edit Go is a popular game in China Japan and Korea and the 2016 matches were watched by perhaps a hundred million people worldwide 66 78 Many top Go players characterized AlphaGos unorthodox plays as seeminglyquestionable moves that initially befuddled onlookers but made sense in hindsight 70 All but the very best Go players craft their style by imitating top players AlphaGo seems to have totally original moves it creates itself 66 AlphaGo appeared to have unexpectedly become much stronger even when compared with its October 2015 match 79 where a computer had beaten a Go professional for the first time ever without the advantage of a handicap 80 The day after Lees first defeat Jeong Ahram the lead Go correspondent for one of South Koreas biggest daily newspapers said Last night was very gloomy Many people drank alcohol 81 The Korea Baduk Association the organization that oversees Go professionals in South Korea awarded AlphaGo an honorary 9dan title for exhibiting creative skills and pushing forward the games progress 82 Chinas Ke Jie an 18yearold generally recognized as the worlds best Go player at the time 32 83 initially claimed that he would be able to beat AlphaGo but declined to play against it for fear that it would copy my style 83 As the matches progressed Ke Jie went back and forth stating that it is highly likely that I could lose after analysing the first three matches 84 but regaining confidence after AlphaGo displayed flaws in the fourth match 85 Toby Manning the referee of AlphaGos match against Fan Hui and Hajin Lee secretary general of the International Go Federation both reason that in the future Go players will get help from computers to learn what they have done wrong in games and improve their skills 80 After game two Lee said he felt speechless From the very beginning of the match I could never manage an upper hand for one single move It was AlphaGos total victory 86 Lee apologized for his losses stating after game three that I misjudged the capabilities of AlphaGo and felt powerless 66 He emphasized that the defeat was Lee Sedols defeat and not a defeat of mankind 26 74 Lee said his eventual loss to a machine was inevitable but stated that robots will never understand the beauty of the game the same way that we humans do 74 Lee called his game four victory a priceless win that I would not exchange for anything 26 Similar systems edit Facebook has also been working on its own Goplaying system darkforest also based on combining machine learning and Monte Carlo tree search 64 87 Although a strong player against other computer Go programs as of early 2016 it had not yet defeated a professional human player 88 Darkforest has lost to CrazyStone and Zen and is estimated to be of similar strength to CrazyStone and Zen 89 DeepZenGo a system developed with support from videosharing website Dwango and the University of Tokyo lost 21 in November 2016 to Go master Cho Chikun who holds the record for the largest number of Go title wins in Japan 90 91 A 2018 paper in Nature cited AlphaGos approach as the basis for a new means of computing potential pharmaceutical drug molecules 92 Example game edit AlphaGo Master white v Tang Weixing 31 December 2016 AlphaGo won by resignation White 36 was widely praised First 99 moves Moves 100186 149 at 131 150 at 130 Impacts on Go edit The AlphaGo documentary film 93 94 raised hopes that Lee Sedol and Fan Hui would have benefitted from their experience of playing AlphaGo but as of May 2018 their ratings were little changed Lee Sedol was ranked 11th in the world and Fan Hui 545th 95 However the overall Go community may have been moved forward in how it
