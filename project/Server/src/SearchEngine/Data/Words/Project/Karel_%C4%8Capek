Čapek was born in 1890 in the village of Malé Svatoňovice in the Bohemian mountains However six months after his birth the Čapek family moved to their own house in Úpice 12 Karel Čapeks father Antonín Čapek worked as a doctor at the local textile factory 13 Antonín was a very active person apart from his work as a doctor he also cofunded the local museum and was a member of the town council 14 Despite opposing his fathers materialist and positivist views Karel Čapek loved and admired his father later calling him a good example of the generation of national awakeners 15 Karels mother Božena Čapková was a homemaker 13 Unlike her husband she did not like life in the country and she suffered from longterm depression 14 Despite that she assiduously collected and recorded local folklore such as legends songs and stories 16 Karel was the youngest of three siblings He would maintain an especially close relationship with his brother Josef a highly successful painter living and working with him throughout his adult life 17 His sister Helena was a talented pianist who later become a writer and published several memoirs about Karel and Josef 18 After finishing elementary school in Úpice Karel moved with his grandmother to Hradec Králové where he started attending high school Two years later the school expelled him for taking part in an illegal students club 13 Čapek later described the club as a very nonmurderous anarchist society 19 After this incident he moved to Brno with his sister and attempted to finish high school there but two years later he moved again to Prague where he finished high school at the Academic Grammar School in 1909 13 20 During his teenage years Čapek became enamored with the visual arts especially Cubism which influenced his later writing 21 After graduating from high school he studied philosophy and aesthetics in Prague at Charles University but he also spent some time at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin and at the Sorbonne University in Paris 13 22 While still a university student he wrote some works on contemporary art and literature 23 He graduated with a doctorate of philosophy in 1915 24 World War I and Interwar period edit Exempted from military service due to the spinal problems that would haunt him his whole life Čapek observed World War I from Prague His political views were strongly affected by the war and as a budding journalist he began to write on topics like nationalism totalitarianism and consumerism 25 Through social circles the young author developed close relationships with many of the political leaders of the nascent Czechoslovak state including Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk Czechoslovak patriot and the first President of Czechoslovakia and his son Jan Masaryk 26 27 who would later become minister of foreign affairs T G Masaryk was a regular guest at Čapeks Friday Men garden parties for leading Czech intellectuals Čapek was also a member of Masaryks Hrad political network 28 Their frequent conversations on various topics later served as the basis for Čapeks book Talks with T G Masaryk 29 Tomb of Karel Čapek and Olga Scheinpflugová at Vyšehrad cemetery Čapek began his writing career as a journalist With his brother Josef he worked as an editor for the Czech paper Národní listy The National Newspaper from October 1917 to April 1921 30 Upon leaving he and Josef joined the staff of Lidové noviny The Peoples Paper in April 1921 31 Čapeks early attempts at fiction were short stories and plays for the most part written with his brother Josef 32 33 Čapeks first international success was RUR a dystopian work about a bad day at a factory populated with sentient androids The play was translated into English in 1922 and was being performed in the UK and America by 1923 Throughout the 1920s Čapek worked in many writing genres producing both fiction and nonfiction but worked primarily as a journalist 25 In the 1930s Čapeks work focused on the threat of brutal national socialist and fascist dictatorships by the mid1930s Čapek had become an outspoken antifascist 25 He also became a member of International PEN Club Established and was the first president of the Czechoslovak PEN Club 10 Late life and death edit In 1935 Karel Čapek married actress Olga Scheinpflugová after a long acquaintance 13 34 In 1938 it became clear that the Western allies namely France and the United Kingdom would fail to fulfil the prewar treaty agreements and they refused to defend Czechoslovakia against Nazi Germany Although offered the chance to go to exile in England Čapek refused to leave his country even though the Nazi Gestapo had named him public enemy number two 35 While repairing flood damage to his familys summer house in Stará Huť he contracted a common cold 30 As he had suffered all his life from spondyloarthritis and was also a heavy smoker Karel Čapek died of pneumonia on 25 December 1938 33 Surprisingly the Gestapo was not aware of his death Several months later just after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia Nazi agents came to the Čapek family house in Prague to arrest him 11 Upon discovering that he had already been dead for some time they arrested and interrogated his wife Olga 36 His brother Josef was arrested in September and eventually died in the BergenBelsen concentration camp in April 1945 37 Karel Čapek and his wife are buried at the Vyšehrad cemetery in Prague The inscription on the tombstone reads Here would have been buried Josef Čapek painter and poet Grave far away 35 Writing edit Karel Čapeks handwriting Karel Čapek wrote with intelligence and humor on a wide variety of subjects His works are known for their interesting and precise description of reality 38 Čapek is renowned for his excellent work with the Czech language 39 40 He is known as a science fiction author who wrote before science fiction became widely recognized as a separate genre Many of his works also discuss ethical aspects of industrial inventions and processes already anticipated in the first half of the 20th century These include mass production nuclear weapons and intelligent artificial beings such as robots or androids His most productive years were during The First Republic of Czechoslovakia 19181938 Čapek also expressed fear of social disasters dictatorship violence human stupidity the unlimited power of corporations and greed Čapek tried to find hope and the way out From the 1930s onward Čapeks work became increasingly antifascist antimilitarist and critical of what he saw as irrationalism 41 Ivan Klíma in his biography of Čapek notes his influence on modern Czech literature as well as on the development of Czech as a written language Čapek along with contemporaries like Jaroslav Hašek spawned part of the early 20thcentury revival in written Czech thanks to their decision to use the vernacular Klíma writes It is thanks to Čapek that the written Czech language grew closer to the language people actually spoke 17 Čapek was also a translator and his translations of French poetry into the language inspired a new generation of Czech poets 17 His other books and plays include detective stories novels fairy tales and theatre plays and even a book on gardening 42 His most important works attempt to resolve problems of epistemology to answer the question What is knowledge Examples include Tales from Two Pockets and the first book of the trilogy of novels Hordubal Meteor and An Ordinary Life He also cowrote with his brother Josef the libretto for Zdeněk Folprecht s opera Lásky hra osudná in 1922 43 After World War II Čapeks work was only reluctantly accepted by the communist government of Czechoslovakia because during his life he had refused to accept communism as a viable alternative He was the first in a series of influential nonMarxist intellectuals who wrote a newspaper essay in a series called Why I am not a Communist 44 In 2009 70 years after his death a book was published containing extensive correspondence by Karel Čapek in which the writer discusses the subjects of pacifism and his conscientious objection to military service with lawyer Jindřich Groag from Brno Until then only a portion of these letters were known 45 Arthur Miller wrote in 1990 I read Karel Čapek for the first time when I was a college student longago in the Thirties There was no writer like himprophetic assurance mixed with surrealistic humour and hardedged social satire a unique combinationhe is a joy to read 46 Etymology of robot edit RUR theatrical poster 1939 Karel Čapek introduced and made popular the frequently used international word robot which first appeared in his play RUR in 1920 While it is frequently thought that he was the originator of the word he wrote a short letter in reference to an article in the Oxford English Dictionary etymology in which he named his brother painter and writer Josef Čapek as its actual inventor 47 48 In an article in the Czech journal Lidové noviny in 1933 he also explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři from Latin labor work However he did not like the word seeing it as too artificial and sought advice from his brother Josef who suggested roboti robots in English The word robot comes from the word robota The word robota means literally corvée serf labor and figuratively drudgery or hard work in Czech It also means work labor in Slovak archaic Czech and many other Slavic languages eg Bulgarian Russian Serbian Polish Macedonian Ukrainian etc It derives from the reconstructed ProtoSlavic word orbota meaning work hard work obligatory work for the king or a short form used for plowing Awards and honors edit The asteroid 1931 Čapek discovered by Luboš Kohoutek was named after him 49 Čapek
