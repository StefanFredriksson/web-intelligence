digital media distribution and online gaming through Xbox Live and by popularizing game achievement awards 21 PC Magazine considered the Xbox 360 the prototype for online gaming as it proved that online gaming communities could thrive in the console space 17 Five years after the Xbox 360s original debut the wellreceived Kinect motion capture camera was released which set the record of being the fastest selling consumer electronic device in history and extended the life of the console 33 Edge ranked Xbox 360 the secondbest console of the 19932013 period stating It had its own social network crossgame chat new indie games every week and the best version of just about every multiformat game Killzone is no Halo and nowadays Gran Turismo is no Forza but its not about the exclusivestheres nothing to trump Naughty Dog s PS3 output after all Rather its about the choices Microsoft made back in the original Xboxs lifetime The PClike architecture meant the early EA Sports games ran at 60fps compared to only 30 on PS3 Xbox Live meant every dedicated player had an existing friends list and Halo meant Microsoft had the killer nextgeneration exclusive And when developers demo games on PC now they do it with a 360 padanother industry benchmark and a critical one 34 Sales Region Units sold First available United States 254 million as of March31 2011 update 35 November

completely upon release in all regions except in Japan 42 43 44 45 Forty thousand units were offered for sale on auction site eBay during the initial week of release 10 of the total supply 46 By years end Microsoft had shipped 15 million units including 900000 in North America 500000 in Europe and 100000 in Japan 47 In May 2008 Microsoft announced that 10million Xbox 360s had been sold and that it was the first current generation gaming console to surpass the 10 million figure in the US 48 In the US the Xbox 360 was the leader in currentgeneration home console sales until June 2008 when it was surpassed by the Wii 49 50 51 The Xbox 360 has sold a total of 870000 units in Canada as of August 1 2008 52 Between January 2011 and October 2013 the Xbox 360 was the bestselling console in the

15million units from 2005 to 2011 37 Edge magazine reported in August 2011 that initially lackluster and subsequently falling sales in Japan where Microsoft had been unable to make serious inroads into the dominance of domestic rivals Sony and Nintendo had led to retailers scaling down and in some cases discontinuing sales of the Xbox 360 completely 56 The significance of Japans poor sales might be overstated in the media in comparison to overall international sales 57 Legacy The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor and although not the bestselling console of the seventh generation it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of wellestablished rivals 24 The inexpensive Nintendo Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of thirdparty software support in its later years and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012 21 58 59 60 61 62 The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality games 63 making it far less dominant than its predecessor the PlayStation 2 and it took until late in the PlayStation 3s lifespan for its sales and games to reach parity with the Xbox 360 TechRadar proclaimed that Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor Xbox One 21 The Xbox 360s advantage over its competitors was due to the release of highprofile games from both first party and third party developers The 2007 Game Critics Awards honored the platform with 38 nominations and 12 wins more than any other platform 64 65 By March 2008 the Xbox 360 had reached a software attach rate of 75 games per console in the US the rate

360 by the end of the year 67 As well as enjoying exclusives such as additions to the Halo franchise and Gears of War the Xbox 360 has managed to gain a simultaneous release of games that were initially planned to be PS3 exclusives including Devil May Cry 4 68 Ace Combat 6 69 Virtua Fighter 5 70 Grand Theft Auto IV 71 Final Fantasy XIII 72 Tekken 6 73 Metal Gear Solid Rising 74 and LA Noire 75 In addition Xbox 360 versions of crossplatform games were generally considered superior to their PS3 counterparts in 2006 and 2007 due in part to the difficulties of programming for the PS3 76 TechRadar deemed the Xbox 360 as the most influential game system through its emphasis of digital media distribution Xbox Live online gaming service and game achievement feature 21 During the consoles lifetime the Xbox brand has grown from gamingonly to encompassing all multimedia turning it into a hub for livingroom computing environment 18 19 20 Five years after the Xbox 360s original debut the

the Console or Power Adapter commonly nicknamed the Red Ring of Death The original model of the Xbox 360 has been subject to a number of technical problems Since the consoles release in 2005 users have reported concerns over its reliability and failure rate 106 107 108 To aid customers with defective consoles Microsoft extended the Xbox 360s manufacturers warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate a General Hardware Failure error report A General Hardware Failure is recognized on all models released before the Xbox 360 S by three quadrants of the ring around the power button flashing red This error is often known as the Red Ring of Death 109 In April 2009 the warranty was extended to also cover failures related to the E74 error code 110 The warranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures that do not generate these specific error codes Since these problems surfaced Microsoft has attempted to modify the console to improve its reliability Modifications include a reduction in the number size and placement of components the addition of dabs of epoxy on the corners and edges of the CPU and GPU as glue to prevent movement relative to the board during heat expansion 111 and a second GPU heatsink to dissipate more heat 112 With the release of the redesigned Xbox 360 S the warranty for the newer models does not include the threeyear extended coverage for General Hardware Failures 113 The newer Xbox 360 S and E models indicate system overheating when the consoles power button begins to flash red unlike previous models where the first and third quadrant of the ring would light up red around the power button if overheating occurred The system will then warn the user of imminent system shutdown until the system has cooled 114
