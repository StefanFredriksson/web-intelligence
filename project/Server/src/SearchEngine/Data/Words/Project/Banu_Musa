Banū Mūsā Persian scholars This article is about the 9th century Baghdad scholars For the Iberian dynasty sometimes called the Banū Mūsā see Banu Qasi Banū Mūsā An illustration of a selftrimming lamp from Ahmads On Mechanical Devices written in Arabic dubious discuss Born 9th century Academic background Influences Apollonius of Perga Ptolemy Galen AlMaʾmūn Mūsā ibn Shākir Yahya ibn Abi Mansur Academic work Era Islamic Golden Age Main interests Astronomy geometry Notable works Book of Ingenious Devices Book on the Measurement of Plane and Spherical Figures Notable ideas Application of arithmetic to geometry 1 Influenced Thabit ibn Qurra Hunayn Ibn Ishaq Ibn alHaytham Naṣīr alDīn alṬūsī Gerard of Cremona Leonardo Fibonacci Jordanus de Nemore Roger Bacon 2 The Banū Mūsā brothers Sons of Moses namely Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir before 803 February 873 Abū alQāsim Aḥmad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir d 9th century and AlḤasan ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir d 9th century were three 9thcentury Persian 3 4 scholars who lived and worked in Baghdad They are known for their Book of Ingenious Devices on automata automatic machines and mechanical devices Another important work of theirs is the Book on the Measurement of Plane and Spherical Figures a foundational work on geometry that was frequently quoted by both Islamic and European mathematicians 2 The Banu Musa worked in astronomical observatories established in Baghdad by the Abbasid Caliph alMamun as well as doing research in the House of Wisdom They also participated in a 9thcentury expedition to make geodesic measurements to determine the length of a degree 2 Contents 1 Life 2 Mathematics and mechanics 3 Astronomy 4 Politics 5 Works 51 Automata 52 Astronomy 53 Astrology 54 Mathematics 6 See also 7 References 8 Further

alMamun who was then a governor of Khorasan and staying in Marw Musa was employed as an astrologer and astronomer 6 After his death his young sons were looked after by the court of alMaʾmūn 7 AlMaʾmūn recognized the abilities of the three brothers and enrolled them in the famous House of Wisdom a library and a translation center in Baghdad 8 Studying in the House of Wisdom under Yahya ibn Abi Mansur 6 they participated in the efforts to translate ancient Greek works into Arabic by sending for Greek texts from the Byzantines paying large sums for their translation and learning Greek themselves 7 On such trips Muhammad met and recruited the famous mathematician and translator Thābit ibn Qurra At some point Hunayn ibn Ishaq was also part of their team 2 The brothers sponsored many scientists and translators who were paid about 500 dīnārs a month Had it not been for the brothers efforts many of the Greek texts that they translated would have been lost and forgotten 5 After the death of alMamun the Banu Musa continued to work under the Caliphs alMutasim alWathiq and alMutawakkil However during the reign of alWathiq and alMutawakkil internal rivalries arose between the scholars in the House of Wisdom At some point the Banu Musa became enemies of alKindi and contributed to his persecution by alMutawakkil They were later employed by alMutawakkil to construct a canal for the new city of alJafariyya 1 Mathematics and mechanics edit The Banu Musa had a different view on area and circumference from the Greeks In the research they translated the Greeks looked at volume and area more in terms of ratios rather than giving them an actual numerical value Most of them based such measurements relatively on another objects size In one of their surviving publications the Kitab Marifat Masahat AlAshkal The Book of the Measurement of Plane and Spherical Figures Banu Musa gave volume and area number values This is evidence that they were not just translating and reproducing the Greek sources They were actually building on concepts and coming up with some of their own original works 1 The most popular of their publications was the Kitāb alḤiyal The Tricks Book which was mostly the work of Aḥmad the middle brother was a book filled with one hundred mechanical devices There were some real practical inventions in the book including a lamp that would mechanically dim alternating fountains and a clamshell grab Eighty of these devices were described as trick vessels that showed a real mastery of mechanics with a real focus on the use of light pressure Some of the devices seem to be replications of earlier Greek works but the rest were much more advanced than what the Greeks had done Astronomy edit They made many observations and contributions to the field of astronomy writing nearly a dozen publications over their astronomical research They made many observations on the sun and the moon AlMamun had them go to a desert in Mesopotamia to measure the length of a degree They also measured the length of a year specify to be 365 days and 6 hours 1 Politics edit Although they were not made famous by their politics they did have interests outside the world of science mainly the oldest brother Muhammad citation needed They were employed by the caliphs for many different projects including the canal mentioned above and they were also a part of a team of 20 hired to build the town of alDjaʿfariyya for alMutawakkil Taking on these types of civil projects naturally got them involved in the political scene in Baghdad However the height of Muhammads political activity in the palace came towards the end of his life during a time when Turkish commanders were starting to take control of the state After alMutawakkil died Muhammad helped alMustaʿīn get the nomination instead of the caliphs brother When the caliphs brother besieged the city of Baghdad Muhammad was sent to estimate the size of the army and when the siege was over he was sent to get the terms of how alMustaʿīn would renounce the throne This evidence shows where Muhammad ranks at that time He was trusted and respected by the highest levels of authority at that time Works edit The Banu Musa wrote almost 20 books the majority of which are now lost 2 Automata edit Most notable among their achievements is their work in the field of automation which they utilized in toys and other entertaining creations They have shown important advances over those of their Greek predecessors 2 The Book of Ingenious Devices describes 100 inventions the ones which have been reconstructed work as designed While designed primarily for amusement purposes they employ innovative engineering technologies such as oneway and twoway valves able to open and close by themselves mechanical memories devices to respond to feedback and delays Most of these devices were operated by water pressure 7 Qarasṭūn a treatise on weight balance 8 On Mechanical Devices a work on pneumatic devices written by Ahmad 8 A Book on the Description of the Instrument Which Sounds by Itself about musical theory 8 Astronomy edit Book on the First Motion of the Celestial Sphere Kitāb Ḥarakāt alfalak alūlā containing a critique of the Ptolemaic system Muhammad in this book denied the existence of the Ptolemaic 9th sphere which Ptolemy thought was responsible for the motion 2 Book on the Mathematical Proof by Geometry That There Is Not a Ninth Sphere Outside the Sphere of the Fixed Stars by Ahmad Book on The Construction of the Astrolabe quoted by alBiruni 2 Book on the Solar Year was traditionally attributed to Thābit ibn Qurra but recent research has shown that it was actually by the Banu Musa 2 On the Visibility of the Crescent by Muhammad Book on the Beginning of the World by Muhammad Book on the Motion of Celestial Spheres Kitāb Ḥarakāt alaflāk by Muhammad Book of Astronomy Kitāb alHayʾa by Muhammad A book of zij by Ahmad Another book of zij listed under the Banu Musa mentioned by Ibn Yunus 2 Astrology edit Cover of Kitāb alDaraj The book of degrees by Ahmad as found in the Saladin library from before 1193 AD citation needed A translation of a Chinese work called A Book of Degrees on the Nature of Zodiacal Signs Kitāb alDaraj The book of degrees by Ahmad 6 Mathematics edit Book on the Measurement of Plane and Spherical Figures later edited by Naṣīr alDīn alṬūsī in the 13th century A Latin translation by Gerard of Cremona appeared the 12th century under the titles Liber trium fratrum de geometria and Verba filiorum Moysi filii Sekir This treatise on geometry was used extensively in the Middle Ages quoted by authors such as Thābit ibn Qurra Ibn alHaytham Leonardo Fibonacci in his Practica geometriae Jordanus de Nemore and Roger Bacon 2 Some theorems included in this book are not found in any work of the Greek mathematicians 8 Conic Sections of Apollonius of Perga a recension of the Greek work which was first translated to Arabic by Hilāl alḥimṣī and Thābit ibn Qurra 8 Book on an Oblong Round Figure which contains a description of procedure used to draw an ellipse using a string now called the gardeners construction 2 Reasoning which on the Trisection of an Angle by Aḥmad citation needed A treatise containing a discussion which between Ahmad and Sanad ibn ʿAli Book on a Geometric Proposition Proved by Galen See also edit Nuʿaym
