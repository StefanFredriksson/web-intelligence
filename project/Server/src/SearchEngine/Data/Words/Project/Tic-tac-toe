Paperandpencil game Players 2 Setup time Minimal Playing time 1 minute Random chance None Skills required Strategy tactics observation Synonyms Noughts and crosses Xs and Os Tictactoe American English noughts and crosses British English or Xs and Os is a paperandpencil game for two players X and O who take turns marking the spaces in a 33 grid The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal vertical or diagonal row is the winner The following example game is won by the first player X Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw Hence tictactoe is most often played by young children who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy Because of the simplicity of tictactoe it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tictactoe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions the state space complexity or the 26830 possible games up to rotations and reflections the game tree complexity on this space 1 The game can be generalized to an mnkgame in which two players alternate placing stones of their own color on an m n board with the goal of getting k of their own color in a row Tictactoe is the 333game 2 Hararys generalized tictactoe is an even broader generalization of tictactoe It can also be generalized as a n d game Tictactoe is the game where n equals 3 and d equals 2 3 If played properly the game will end in a draw making tictactoe a futile game 4 Contents 1 History 2 Combinatorics 3 Strategy 31 Further details 4 Variations 5 English names 6 In popular culture 7 See also 8 References 9 External links History edit Games played on threeinarow boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt 5 where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BCE 6 An early variation of tictactoe was played in the Roman Empire around the first century BC It was called terni lapilli three pebbles at a time and instead of having any number of pieces each player only had three thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing 7 The games grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome Another closely related ancient game is three mens morris which is also played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to finish 8 and Picaria a game of the Puebloans The different names of the game are more recent The first print reference to noughts and crosses nought being an alternative word for zero the British name appeared in 1858 in an issue of Notes and Queries 9 The first print reference to a game called ticktacktoe occurred in 1884 but referred to a childrens game played on a slate consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set the number hit being scored Tictactoe may also derive from ticktack the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558 The US renaming of noughts and crosses as tictactoe occurred in the 20th century 10 In 1952 OXO or Noughts and Crosses developed by British computer scientist Alexander S Douglas for the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge became one of the first known video games 11 12 The computer player could play perfect games of tictactoe against a human opponent 11 In 1975 tictactoe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements The Tinkertoy computer made out of almost only Tinkertoys is able to play tictactoe perfectly 13 It is currently on display at the Museum of Science Boston Combinatorics edit When considering only the state of the board and after taking into account board symmetries ie rotations and reflections there are only 138 terminal board positions A combinatorics study of the game shows that when X makes the first move every time the game is won as follows 14 91 distinct positions are won by X 44 distinct positions are won by O 3 distinct positions are drawn often called a cats game 15 Strategy edit Optimal strategy for player X if starting in a corner In each grid the shaded red X denotes the optimal move and the location of Os next move gives the next subgrid to examine Note that only two sequences of moves by O both starting with center topright leftmid lead to a draw with the remaining sequences leading to wins from X Optimal strategy for player O Player O can only force a win or draw by playing in the centre first A player can play a perfect game of tictactoe to win or at least draw if each time it is their turn to play they choose the first available move from the following list as used in Newell and Simons 1972 tictactoe program 16 Win If the player has two in a row they can place a third to get three in a row Block If the opponent has two in a row the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent Fork Create an opportunity where the player has two ways to win two nonblocked lines of 2 Blocking an opponents fork If there is only one possible fork for the opponent the player should block it Otherwise the player should block all forks in any way that simultaneously allows them to create two in a row Otherwise the player should create a two in a row to force the opponent into defending as long as it doesnt result in them creating a fork For example if X has two opposite corners and O has the center O must not play a corner in order to win Playing a corner in this scenario creates a fork for X to win Center A player marks the center If it is the first move of the game playing on a corner gives the second player more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice however it makes no difference between perfect players Opposite corner If the opponent is in the corner the player plays the opposite corner Empty corner The player plays in a corner square Empty side The player plays in a middle square on any of the 4 sides The first player who shall be designated X has 3 possible positions to mark during the first turn Superficially it might seem that there are 9 possible positions corresponding to the 9 squares in the grid However by rotating the board we will find that in the first turn every corner mark is strategically equivalent to every other corner mark The same is true of every edge side middle mark For strategy purposes there are therefore only three possible first marks corner edge or center Player X can win or force a draw from any of these starting marks however playing the corner gives the opponent the smallest choice of squares which must be played to avoid losing 17 This might suggest that the corner is the best opening move for X however another study 18 shows that if the players are not perfect an opening move in the center is best for X The second player who shall be designated O must respond to Xs opening mark in such a way as to avoid the forced win Player O must always respond to a corner opening with a center mark and to a center opening with a corner mark An edge opening must be answered either with a center mark a corner mark next to the X or an edge mark opposite the X Any other responses will allow X to force the win Once the opening is completed Os task is to follow the above list of priorities in order to force the draw or else to gain a win if X makes a weak play More detailed to guarantee a draw O should adopt the following strategies If X plays corner opening move O should take center and then an edge forcing X to block in the next move This will stop any forks from happening When both X and O are perfect players and X chooses to start by marking a corner O takes the center and X takes the corner opposite the original In that case O is free to choose any edge as its second move However if X is not a perfect player and has played a corner and then an edge O should not play the opposite edge as its second move because then X is not forced to block in the next move and can fork If X plays edge opening move O should take center or one of the corners adjacent to X and then follow the above list of priorities mainly paying attention to block forks If X plays center opening move O should take corner and then follow the above list of priorities mainly paying attention to block forks When X plays corner first and O is not a perfect player the following may happen If O responds with a center mark best move for them a perfect X player will take the corner opposite the original Then O should play an edge However if O plays a corner as its second move a perfect X player will mark the remaining corner blocking Os 3inarow and making their own fork If O responds with a corner mark X is guaranteed to win by simply taking any of the other two corners and then the last a fork since when X takes the third corner O can only take the position between the two Xs Then X can take the only remaining corner to win If O responds with an edge mark X is guaranteed to win by taking center then O can only take the corner opposite the corner which X plays first Finally X can take a corner to create a fork and then X will win on the next move Further details edit Consider a board with the nine positions numbered as follows 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 When X plays 1 as their opening move then O should take 5 Then X takes 9 in this situation O should not take 3 or 7 O should take 2 4 6 or 8 X1 O5 X9 O2 X8 O7 X3 O6 X4 this game will be a draw or 6 in this situation O should not take 4 or 7 O should take 2 3 8 or 9 In fact taking 9 is the best move since a nonperfect player X may take 4 then O can take 7 to win X1 O5 X6 O2 X8 then O should not take 3 or X can take 7 to win and O should not take 4 or X can take 9 to win O should take 7 or 9 X1 O5 X6 O2 X8 O7 X3 O9 X4 this game will be a draw X1 O5 X6 O2 X8 O9 X4 7 O7 4 X3 this game will be a draw X1 O5 X6 O3 X7 O4 X8 9 O9 8 X2 this game will be a draw X1 O5 X6 O8 X2 O3 X7 O4 X9 this game will be a draw X1 O5 X6 O9 then X should not take 4 or O can take 7 to win X should take 2 3 7 or 8 X1 O5 X6 O9 X2 O3 X7 O4 X8 this game will be a draw X1 O5 X6 O9 X3 O2 X8 O4 7 X7 4 this game will be a draw X1 O5 X6 O9 X7 O4 X2 3 O3 2 X8 this game will be a draw X1 O5 X6 O9 X8 O2 3 4 7 X47 47 23 23 O74 74 32 32 X3 2 7 4 this game will be a draw In both of these situations X takes 9 or 6 as second move X has a 1 3 property to win If X is not a perfect player X may take 2 or 3 as second move Then this game will be a draw X cannot win X1 O5 X2 O3 X7 O4 X6 O8 9 X9 8 this game will be a draw X1 O5 X3 O2 X8 O4 6 X6 4 O9 7 X7 9 this game will be a draw If X plays 1 opening move and O is not a perfect player the following may happen Although O takes the only good position 5 as first move but O takes a bad position as second move X1 O5 X9 O3 X7 then X can take 4 or 8 to win X1 O5 X6 O4 X3 then X can take 2 or 9 to win X1 O5 X6 O7 X3 then X can take 2 or 9 to win Although O takes good positions as the first two moves but O takes a bad position as third move X1 O5 X6 O2 X8 O3 X7 then X can take 4 or 9 to win X1 O5 X6 O2 X8 O4 X9 then X can take 3 or 7 to win O takes a bad position as first move except of 5 all other positions are bad X1 O3 X7 O4 X9 then X can take 5 or 8 to win X1 O9 X3 O2 X7 then X can take 4 or 5 to win X1 O2 X5 O9 X7 then X can take 3 or 4 to win X1 O6 X5 O9 X3 then X can take 2 or 7 to win Variations edit Main article Tictactoe variants Many board games share the element of trying to be the first to get n inarow including three mens morris nine mens morris pente gomoku Qubic Connect Four Quarto Gobblet Order and Chaos Toss Across and Mojo Tictactoe is an instance of an mnkgame where two players alternate taking turns on an m n board until one of them gets k in a row Hararys generalized tictactoe is an even broader generalization Other variations of tictactoe include 3dimensional tictactoe on a 333 board In this game the first player has an easy win by playing in the centre if 2 people are playing One can play on a board of 4x4 squares winning in several ways Winning can include 4 in a straight line 4 in a diagonal line 4 in a diamond or 4 to make a square Another variant Qubic is played on a 444 board it was solved by Oren Patashnik in 1980 the first player can force a win 19 Higher dimensional variations are also possible 3 In misère tictactoe the player wins if the opponent gets n in a row 20 A 33 game is a draw More generally the first player can draw or win on any board of any dimension whose side length is odd by playing first in the central cell and then mirroring the opponents moves 3 In wild tictactoe players can choose to place either X or O on each move 21 22 23 Number Scrabble or Pick15 24 is isomorphic to tictactoe but on the surface appears completely different 25 Two players in turn say a number between one and nine A particular number may not be repeated The game is won by the player who has said three numbers whose sum is 15 24 26 If all the numbers are used and no one gets three numbers that add up to 15 then the game is a draw 24 Plotting these numbers on a 33 magic square shows that the game exactly corresponds with tictactoe since three numbers will be arranged in a straight line if and only if they total 15 27 e a t b ee l e ss e a i r b i t s l i p i s o d a b oo k l o t o s a b l t Another isomorphic game uses a list of nine carefully chosen words for instance eat bee less air bits lip soda book and lot Each player picks one word in turn and to win a player must select three words with the same letter The words may be plotted on a tictactoe grid in such a way that a threeinarow line wins 28 Numerical Tic Tac Toe is a variation invented by the mathematician Ronald Graham The numbers 1 to 9 are used in this game The first player plays with the odd numbers the second player plays with the even numbers All numbers can be used only once The player who puts down 15 points in a line wins sum of 3 numbers In the 1970s there was a two player game made by Triang Toys Games called Check Lines in which the board consisted of eleven holes arranged in a geometrical pattern of twelve straight lines each containing three of the holes Each player had exactly five tokens and played in turn placing one token in any of the holes The winner was the first player whose tokens were arranged in two lines of three which by definition were intersecting lines If neither player had won by the tenth turn subsequent turns consisted of moving one of ones own tokens to the remaining empty hole with the constraint that this move could only be from an adjacent hole 29 Quantum tic tac toe allows players to place a quantum superposition of numbers on the board ie the players moves are superpositions of plays in the original classical game This variation was invented by Allan Goff of Novatia Labs 30 English names edit
