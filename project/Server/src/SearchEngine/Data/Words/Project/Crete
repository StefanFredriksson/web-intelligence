as Amari valley fertile plateaus such as Lasithi plateau Omalos and Nidha caves such as Gourgouthakas Diktaion and Idaion the birthplace of the ancient Greek god Zeus and a number of gorges Mountains in Crete are the object of tremendous fascination both for locals and tourists The mountains have been seen as a key feature of the islands distinctiveness especially since the time of Romantic travellers writing Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders the former often claim to reside in places affording a higherbetter climatic but also moral environment In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors the mountains are seen as having determined their residents resistance to past invaders which relates to the oftencountered idea that highlanders are purer in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers For residents of mountainous areas such as Sfakia in western Crete the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged softsoiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world 10 Gorges rivers and lakes edit The island has a number of gorges such as the Samariá Gorge Imbros Gorge

Main article Climate of Greece Crete straddles two climatic zones the Mediterranean and the North African mainly falling within the former As such the climate in Crete is primarily Mediterranean The atmosphere can be quite humid depending on the proximity to the sea while winter is fairly mild Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May but rare in the lowlying areas While some mountain tops are snowcapped for most of the year near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours However a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004 during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow During the Cretan summer average temperatures reach the high 20slow 30s Celsius mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit with maxima touching the upper 30smid 40s The south coast including the Mesara Plain and Asterousia Mountains falls in the North African climatic zone and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year There date palms bear fruit and swallows remain yearround rather than migrate to Africa The fertile region around Ierapetra on the southeastern corner of the island is renowned for its exceptional yearround agricultural production with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in greenhouses throughout the winter 17 Western Crete Chania province receives more rain and is

agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry 23 The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding because of the climate and terrain of the island there has been a drop in manufacturing and an observable expansion in its service industries mainly tourismrelated All three sectors of the Cretan economy agriculturefarming processingpackaging services are directly connected and interdependent The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average whereas unemployment is at approximately 4 onesixth of that of the country overall As in many regions of Greece viticulture and olive groves are significant oranges and citrons are also cultivated Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece therefore bananas were grown on the island predominantly in greenhouses Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as mizithra anthotyros and kefalotyri Transport infrastructure edit European route E75 near Heraklion Airports edit The island has three significant airports Nikos Kazantzakis at Heraklion the Daskalogiannis airport at Chania and a smaller one in Sitia The first two serve

presently an air force base Ferries edit The island is well served by ferries mostly from Athens by ferry companies such as Minoan Lines and ANEK Lines Road Network edit Although the road network leads almost everywhere there is a lack of modern highways although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway 24 Railway edit Also during the 1930s there was a narrowgauge industrial railway in Heraklion from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port There are now no railway lines on Crete The government is planning the construction of a line from Chania to Heraklion via Rethymno 25 26 Development edit Newspapers have reported that the Ministry of Mercantile Marine is ready to support the agreement between Greece South Korea Dubai Ports World and China for the construction of a large international container port and free trade zone in southern Crete near Tympaki the plan is to expropriate 850ha of land The port would handle 2million containers per year but the project has not been universally welcomed because of its environmental economic and cultural impact 27 As of January 2013 the project has still not been confirmed although there is mounting pressure to approve it arising from Greeces difficult economic situation There are plans for underwater cables going from mainland Greece to Israel and Egypt passing by Crete and Cyprus EuroAfrica Interconnector and EuroAsia Interconnector 28 29 They would connect Crete electrically with mainland Greece ending energy isolation of Crete Now Hellenic Republic covers for Crete

literate civilisation It has been ruled by various ancient Greek entities the Roman Empire the Byzantine Empire the Emirate of Crete the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire After a brief period of independence 18971913 under a provisional Cretan government it joined the Kingdom of Greece It was occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War Prehistoric Crete edit Main article Prehistoric Crete In 2002 the paleontologist Gerard Gierlinski discovered fossil footprints left by ancient human relatives 5600000 years ago 31 The first human settlement in Crete dates before 130000 years ago during the Paleolithic age 32 33 34 Settlements dating to the aceramic Neolithic in the 7th millennium BC used cattle sheep goats pigs and dogs as well as domesticated cereals and legumes ancient Knossos was the site of one of these major Neolithic then later Minoan sites 35 Other neolithic settlements include those at Kephala Magasa and Trapeza Minoan civilization edit Main article Minoan civilization Crete was the centre of Europe s first advanced civilization the Minoan c 27001420 BC 2 This civilization wrote in the undeciphered script known as Linear A Early Cretan history is replete with legends such as those of King Minos Theseus and the Minotaur passed on orally via poets such as Homer The volcanic eruption of Thera may have been the cause of the downfall of the Minoan civilization Mycenaean civilization edit Main article Mycenaean Greece In 1420BC the Minoan civilization was overrun by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece The oldest samples of writing in the Greek language as identified by Michael Ventris is the Linear B archive from Knossos dated approximately to 14251375BC 36 Archaic and Classical period edit After the Bronze Age collapse Crete was settled by new waves of Greeks from the mainland A number of city states developed in the Archaic period There was very limited contact with mainland Greece and Greek historiography shows little interest in Crete and as a result there are very few literary sources During the 6th to 4th centuries BC Crete was comparatively free from warfare The Gortyn code 5th century BC is evidence for how codified civil law established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights In the late 4th century BC the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite and Cretes economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states During the 3rd century BC Gortyn Kydonia Chania Lyttos and Polyrrhenia challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos While the cities continued to prey upon one another they invited into their feuds mainland powers like Macedon and its rivals Rhodes and Ptolemaic Egypt In 220 BC the island was tormented by a war between two opposing coalitions of cities As a result the Macedonian king Philip V gained hegemony over Crete which lasted to the end of the Cretan War 205200 BC when the Rhodians opposed the rise of Macedon and the Romans started to interfere in Cretan affairs In the 2nd century BC Ierapytna Ierapetra gained supremacy on eastern Crete Roman rule edit Main article Crete and Cyrenaica Crete was involved in the Mithridatic Wars initially repelling an attack by Roman general Marcus Antonius Creticus in 71BC Nevertheless a ferocious threeyear campaign soon followed under Quintus Caecilius Metellus equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69BC earning for Metellus the title Creticus Gortyn was made capital of the island and Crete became a Roman province along with Cyrenaica that was called Creta et Cyrenaica Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire 37 In the 2nd century AD at least three cities in Crete Lyttos Gortyn Hierapytna joined the Panhellenion a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor Hadrian When Diocletian redivided the Empire Crete was placed along with Cyrene under the diocese of Moesia and later by Constantine I to the diocese of Macedonia Byzantine Empire first period edit Main article Byzantine Crete Arkadi Monastery Crete was separated from Cyrenaica c 297 It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire usually referred to as the Eastern Roman Byzantine Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330 Crete was subjected to an attack by Vandals in 467 the great earthquakes of 365 and 415 a raid by Slavs in 623 Arab raids in 654 and the 670s and again in the 8th

island back in 842 and 843 under Theoktistos Further Byzantine campaigns in 911 and 949 failed In 9601 Nikephoros Phokas campaign completely restored Crete to the Byzantine Empire after a century and a half of Arab control Byzantine Empire second period edit Main article Byzantine Crete In 961 Nikephoros Phokas returned the island to Byzantine rule after expelling the Arabs 40 Extensive efforts at conversion of the populace were undertaken led by John Xenos and Nikon the Metanoeite 41 42 The reconquest of Crete was a major achievement for the Byzantines as it restored Byzantine control over the Aegean littoral and diminished the threat of Saracen pirates for which Crete had provided a base of operations In 1204 the Fourth Crusade seized and sacked the imperial capital of Constantinople Crete was initially granted to leading Crusader Boniface of Montferrat 40 in the partition of spoils that followed However Boniface sold his claim to the Republic of Venice 40 whose forces made up the majority of the Crusade Venices rival the Republic of Genoa immediately seized the island and it was not until 1212 that Venice secured Crete as a colony Venetian rule edit Main article Kingdom of Candia Frangokastello was built by the Venetians in 137174 From 1212 during Venice s rule which lasted more than four centuries a Renaissance swept through the island as is evident from the plethora of artistic works dating to that period Known as The Cretan School or PostByzantine Art it is among the last flowerings of the artistic traditions of the fallen empire The most notable representatives of this Cretan renaissance were the painter El Greco and the writers Nicholas Kalliakis 16451707 Georgios Kalafatis professor c 1652 1720 Andreas Musalus c 1665 1721 and Vitsentzos Kornaros 43 44 45

even prospering such as the family of Simone Stratigo c 1733 c 1824 who migrated to Dalmatia from Crete in 1669 49 Islamic presence on the island aside from the interlude of the Arab occupation was cemented by the Ottoman conquest Most Cretan Muslims were local Greek converts who spoke Cretan Greek but in the islands 19thcentury political context they came to be viewed by the Christian population as Turks 50 Contemporary estimates vary but on the eve of the Greek War of Independence 1830 as much as 45 of the population of the island may have been Muslim 51 A number of Sufi orders were widespread throughout the island the Bektashi order being the most prevalent possessing at least five tekkes Many among them were cryptoChristians who converted back to Christianity in subsequent years while many Cretan Turks fled Crete because of the unrest settling in Turkey Rhodes Syria Libya and elsewhere By 1900 11 of the population was Muslim Those remaining were relocated in the 1924 Population exchange between Greece and Turkey 52 During Easter of 1770 a notable revolt against Ottoman rule in Crete was started by Daskalogiannis a shipowner from Sfakia who was promised support by Orlovs fleet which never arrived Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities Today the airport at Chania is named after him Crete was left out of the modern Greek state by the London Protocol of 1830 and soon it was yielded to Egypt by the Ottoman sultan Egyptian rule was shortlived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the Convention of London on 3 July 1840 Heraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans the deserted city 46 The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a twopronged approach 46 The first was the religious endowments It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties According to Molly Greene 2001 there were numerous records of realestate transactions during the Ottoman rule In the deserted city minorities received equal rights in purchasing property Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the realestate market The Cretan Revolt of 18661869 or Great Cretan Revolution Greek Κρητική Επανάσταση του 1866 was a threeyear uprising against Ottoman rule the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the Greek War of Independence in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898 A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the Holocaust of Arkadi The event occurred in November 1866 as a large Ottoman force besieged the Arkadi Monastery which served as the headquarters of the rebellion In addition to its 259 defenders over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery After a few days of hard fighting the Ottomans broke into the monastery At that point the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monasterys vaults causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there Cretan

was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain France Italy and Russia Germany and AustroHungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898 During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers In March 1898 the Powers decreed with the very reluctant consent of the Sultan that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman suzerainty in the near future 53 In September 1898 an outbreak of rioting in Candia modern Heraklion left over 500 Cretan Christians and 14 British servicemen dead As a result the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island a move that was ultimately completed by early November The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner Prince George of Greece appointed arriving to take up his post in December 1898 54 The flag of the Cretan State was chosen by the Powers with the white star representing the Ottoman suzenraity over the

locals the invasion force suffered heavy casualties and Adolf Hitler forbade further largescale paratroop operations for the rest of the war During the initial and subsequent occupation German firing squads routinely executed male civilians in reprisal for the death of German soldiers civilians were rounded up randomly in local villages for the mass killings such as at the Massacre of Kondomari and the Viannos massacres Two German generals were later tried and executed for their roles in the killing of 3000 of the islands inhabitants 55 Tourism edit Main article Tourism in Greece Matala

ago made up 20 of all charter flights in Greece citation needed Overall more than two million tourists visited Crete some years back when when the increase in tourism was reflected in the number of hotel beds rising by 53 in the period between 1986 and 1991 Today the islands tourism infrastructure caters to all tastes including a very wide range of accommodation the islands facilities take in large luxury hotels with their complete facilities swimming pools sports and recreation smaller familyowned apartments camping facilities and others Visitors reach the island via two international

in Greece Crete There is a large number of archaeological sites which include the Minoan sites of Knossos Malia not to be confused with the town of the same name Petras and Phaistos the classical site of Gortys and the diverse archaeology of the island of Koufonisi which includes Minoan Roman and World War II ruins The latter however has restricted access for the last few years due to conservation concerns so it is best to check before heading to a port There are a number of museums throughout Crete The Heraklion Archaeological Museum displays most of the archaeological finds of the Minoan era and was reopened in 2014 59 Harmful Effects edit Helen Briassoulis proposed in the Journal of Sustainable Tourism that Crete is a victim of external tourist systems applying pressure to it to develop at an unhealthy rate and that informal internal systems within the country are forced to adapt According to her these forces have strengthened in 3 stages from the period from 19601970 19701990 and 1990 to the present During this first period tourism was a largely positive force pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside However beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Cretes natural resources The country is then pulled into an interesting parity where these companies only upkeep those natural resources that are directly essential to their industry View of Gortyn Archaeological site of Phaistos Ruins of the Palace of Knossos Archeological Museum of Chania Museum of Chania Chania Naval museum Pluto and Persephone in Heraklion Museum Jars in Malia Crete Fauna and flora edit Fauna edit Crete is isolated from mainland Europe Asia and Africa and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora As a result the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece Indeed the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears wolves jackals and poisonous snakes to the labour of Hercules who took a live Cretan bull to the Peloponnese Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of Zeus by removing all harmful and poisonous animals from Crete Later Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the Apostle Paul who lived on the island of Crete for two years with his exorcisms and blessings There is a natural history

launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of Dia The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard The islets of Lefkai were the result of a musical contest between the Sirens and the Muses The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera featherless where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai the islands of Souda and Leon 85 Heracles in one of his

rizitiko singing These Associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet up and engage in traditionalist practices The topic of tradition and the role of Cultural Associations in reviving it is very often debated throughout Crete 86 Cretan authors have made important contributions to Greek Literature throughout the modern period major names include Vikentios
