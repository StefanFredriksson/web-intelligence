Reliability engineering Reliability engineering is a subdiscipline of systems engineering that emphasizes dependability in the lifecycle management of a product Reliability describes the ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time 1 Reliability is closely related to availability which is typically described as the ability of a component or system to function at a specified moment or interval of time The Reliability function is theoretically defined as the probability of success Reliability 1 Probability of Failure displaystyle textReliability1textProbability of Failure as Rt the probability of failure at time t as a probability derived from reliability availability testability and maintainability Availability Testability maintainability and maintenance are often defined as a part of reliability engineering in reliability programs Reliability plays a key role in the costeffectiveness of systems for example cars have a higher resale value when they fail less often Reliability and quality are closely related Normally quality focuses on the prevention of defects during the warranty phase whereas reliability looks at preventing failures during the useful lifetime of the product or system from commissioning to decommissioning Reliability engineering deals with the estimation prevention and management of high levels of lifetime engineering uncertainty and risks of failure Although stochastic parameters define and affect reliability reliability is not solely achieved by mathematics and statistics 2 3 One cannot really find a root cause needed to effectively prevent failures by only looking at statistics Nearly all teaching and literature on the subject emphasize these aspects and ignore the reality that the ranges of uncertainty involved largely invalidate quantitative methods for prediction and measurement 4 For example it is easy to represent probability of failure as a symbol or value in an equation but it is almost impossible to predict its true magnitude in practice which is massively multivariate so having the equation for reliability does not begin to equal having an accurate predictive measurement of reliability Reliability engineering relates closely to safety engineering and to system safety in that they use common methods for their analysis and may require input from each other Reliability engineering focuses on costs of failure caused by system downtime cost of spares repair equipment personnel and cost of warranty claims Safety engineering normally focuses more on preserving life and nature than on cost and therefore deals only with particularly dangerous systemfailure modes High reliability safety factor levels also result from good engineering and from attention to detail and almost never from only reactive failure management using reliability accounting and statistics 5 Contents 1 History 2 Overview 21 Objective 22 Scope and techniques 23

term was linked mostly to repeatability a test in any type of science was considered reliable if the same results would be obtained repeatedly In the 1920s product improvement through the use of statistical process control was promoted by Dr Walter A Shewhart at Bell Labs 7 around the time that Waloddi Weibull was working on statistical models for fatigue The development of reliability engineering was here on a parallel path with quality The modern use of the word reliability was defined by the US military in the 1940s characterizing a product that would operate when expected and for a specified period of time In World War II many reliability issues were due to the inherent unreliability of electronic equipment available at the time and to fatigue issues In 1945 MA Miner published the seminal paper titled Cumulative Damage in Fatigue in an ASME journal A main application for reliability engineering in the military was for the vacuum tube as used in radar systems and other electronics for which reliability proved to be very problematic and costly The IEEE formed the Reliability Society in 1948 In 1950 the United States Department of Defense formed group called the Advisory Group on the Reliability of Electronic Equipment AGREE to investigate reliability methods for military equipment 8 This group recommended three main ways of working Improve component reliability Establish quality and reliability requirements for suppliers Collect field data and find root causes of failures In the 1960s more emphasis was given to reliability testing on component and system level The famous military standard MILSTD781 was created at that time Around this period also the muchused predecessor to military handbook 217 was published by RCA and was used for the prediction of failure rates of electronic components The emphasis on component reliability and empirical research eg Mil Std 217 alone slowly decreased More pragmatic approaches as used in the consumer industries were being used In the 1980s televisions were increasingly made up of solidstate semiconductors Automobiles rapidly increased their use of semiconductors with a variety of microcomputers under the hood and in the dash Large air conditioning systems developed electronic controllers as had microwave ovens and a variety of other appliances Communications systems began to adoptelectronics to replace older mechanical switching systems Bellcore issued the first consumer prediction methodology for telecommunications and SAE developed a similar document SAE870050 for automotive applications The nature of predictions evolved during the decade and it became apparent that die complexity wasnt the only factor that determined failure rates for integrated circuits ICsKam Wong published a paper questioning the bathtub curve 9 see also reliabilitycentered maintenance During this decade the failure rate of many components dropped by a factor of 10 Software became important to the reliability of systems By the 1990s the pace of IC development was picking up Wider use of standalone microcomputers was common and the PC market helped keep IC densities following Moores law and doubling about every 18 months Reliability engineering was now changing as it moved towards understanding the physics of failure Failure rates for components kept dropping but systemlevel issues became more prominent Systems thinking became more and more important For software the CMM model Capability Maturity Model was developed which gave a more qualitative approach to reliability ISO 9000 added reliability measures as part of the design and development portion of certification The expansion of the WorldWide Web created new challenges of security and trust The older problem of too little reliability information available had now been replaced by too much information of questionable value Consumer reliability problems could now be discussed online in real time using data New technologies such as microelectromechanical systems MEMS handheld GPS and handheld devices that combined cell phones and computers all represent challenges to maintain reliability Product development time continued to shorten through thisdecade and what had been done in three years was being done in 18 months This meant that reliability tools and tasks had to be more closely tied to the development process itself In many ways reliability became part of everyday life and consumer expectations Overview edit Objective edit The objectives of reliability engineering in decreasing order of priority are 10 To apply engineering knowledge and specialist techniques to prevent or to reduce the likelihood or frequency of failures To identify and correct the causes of failures that do occur despite the efforts to prevent them To determine ways of coping with failures that do occur if their causes have not been corrected To apply methods for estimating the likely reliability of new designs and for analysing reliability data The reason for the priority emphasis is that it is by far the most effective way of working in terms of minimizing costs and generating reliable products The primary skills that are required therefore are the ability to understand and anticipate the possible causes of failures and knowledge of how to prevent them It is also necessary to have knowledge of the methods that can be used for analysing designs and data Scope and techniques edit Reliability engineering for complex systems requires a different more elaborate systems approach than for noncomplex systems Reliability engineering may in that case involve System availability and mission readiness analysis and related reliability and maintenance requirement allocation Functional system failure analysis and derived requirements specification Inherent system design reliability analysis and derived requirements specification for both hardware and software design System diagnostics design Fault tolerant systems eg by redundancy Predictive and preventive maintenance eg reliabilitycentered maintenance Human factors human interaction human errors Manufacturing and assemblyinduced failures effect on the detected 0hour quality and reliability Maintenanceinduced failures Transportinduced failures Storageinduced failures Use load studies component stress analysis and derived requirements specification Software systematic failures Failure reliability testing and derived requirements Field failure monitoring and corrective actions Spare parts stocking availability control Technical documentation caution and warning analysis Data and information acquisitionorganisation creation of a general reliability development hazard log and FRACAS system Chaos engineering Effective reliability engineering requires understanding of the basics of failure mechanisms for which experience broad engineering skills and good knowledge from many different special fields of engineering are required 11 for example Tribology Stress mechanics Fracture mechanics fatigue Thermal engineering Fluid mechanics shockloading engineering Electrical engineering Chemical engineering eg corrosion Material science Definitions edit Reliability may be defined in the following ways The idea that an item is fit for a purpose with respect to time The capacity of a designed produced or maintained item to perform as required over time The capacity of a population of designed produced or maintained items to perform as required over time The resistance to failure of an item over time The probability of an item to perform a required function under stated conditions for a specified period of time The durability of an object Basics of a reliability assessment edit Many engineering techniques are used in reliability risk assessments such as reliability block diagrams hazard analysis failure mode and effects analysis FMEA 12 fault tree analysis FTA Reliability Centered Maintenance probabilistic load and material stress and wear calculations probabilistic fatigue and creep analysis human error analysis manufacturing defect analysis reliability testing etc It is crucial that these analyses are done properly and with much attention to detail to be effective Because of the large number of reliability techniques their expense and the varying degrees of reliability required for different situations most projects develop a reliability program plan to specify the reliability tasks statement of work SoW requirements that will be performed for that specific system Consistent with the creation of safety cases for example per ARP4761 the goal of reliability assessments is to provide a robust set of qualitative and quantitative evidence that use of a component or system will not be associated with unacceptable risk The basic steps to take 13 are to Thoroughly identify relevant unreliability hazards eg potential conditions events human errors failure modes interactions failure mechanisms and root causes by specific analysis or tests Assess the associated system risk by specific analysis or testing Propose mitigation eg requirements design changes detection logic maintenance training by which the risks may be lowered and controlled for at an acceptable level Determine the best mitigation and get agreement on final acceptable risk levels possibly based on costbenefit analysis Risk here is the combination of probability and severity of the failure incident scenario occurring The severity can be looked at from a system safety or a system availability point of view Reliability for safety can be thought of as a very different focus from reliability for system availability Availability and safety can exist in dynamic tension as keeping a system too available can be unsafe Forcing an engineering system into a safe state too quickly can force false alarms that impede the availability of the system In a de minimis definition severity of failures includes the cost of spare parts manhours logistics damage secondary failures and downtime of machines which may cause production loss A more complete definition of failure also can mean injury dismemberment and death of people within the system witness mine accidents industrial accidents space shuttle failures and the same to innocent bystanders witness the citizenry of cities like Bhopal Love Canal Chernobyl or Sendai and other victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunamiin this case reliability engineering becomes system safety What is acceptable is determined by the managing authority or customers or the affected communities Residual risk is the risk that is left over after all reliability activities have finished and includes the unidentified riskand is therefore not completely quantifiable Risk vs costcomplexity 14 The complexity of the technical systems such as improvements of design and materials planned inspections foolproof design and backup redundancy decreases risk and increases the cost The risk can be decreased to ALARA as low as reasonably achievable or ALAPA as low as practically achievable levels Reliability and availability program plan edit Implementing a reliability program is not simply a software purchase it is not just a checklist of items that must be completed that will ensure one has reliable products and processes A reliability program is a complex learning and knowledgebased system unique to ones products and processes It is supported by leadership built on the skills that one develops within a team integrated into business processes and executed by following proven standard work practices 15 A reliability program plan is used to document exactly what best practices tasks methods tools analysis and tests are required for a particular subsystem as well as clarify customer requirements for reliability assessment For largescale complex systems the reliability program plan should be a separate document Resource determination for manpower and budgets for testing and other tasks is critical for a successful program In general the amount of work required for an effective program for complex systems is large A reliability program plan is essential for achieving high levels of reliability testability maintainability and the resulting system availability and is developed early during system development and refined over the systems lifecycle It specifies not only what the reliability engineer does but also the tasks performed by other stakeholders A reliability program plan is approved by top program management which is responsible for allocation of sufficient resources for its implementation A reliability program plan may also be used to evaluate and improve the availability of a system by the strategy of focusing on increasing testability maintainability and not on reliability Improving maintainability is generally easier than improving reliability Maintainability estimates repair rates are also generally more accurate However because the uncertainties in the reliability estimates are in most cases very large they are likely to dominate the availability calculation prediction uncertainty problem even when maintainability levels are very high When reliability is not under control more complicated issues may arise like manpower maintainers customer service capability shortages spare part availability logistic delays lack of repair facilities extensive retrofit and complex configuration management costs and others The problem of unreliability may be increased also due to the domino effect of maintenanceinduced failures after repairs Focusing only on maintainability is therefore not enough If failures are prevented none of the other issues are of any importance and therefore reliability is generally regarded as the most important part of availability Reliability needs to be evaluated and improved related to both availability and the total cost of ownership TCO due to cost of spare parts maintenance manhours transport costs storage cost part obsolete risks etc But as GM and Toyota have belatedly discovered TCO also includes the downstream liability costs when reliability calculations have not sufficiently or accurately addressed customers personal bodily risks Often a tradeoff is needed between the two There might be a maximum ratio between availability and cost of ownership Testability of a system should also be addressed in the plan as this is the link between reliability and maintainability The maintenance strategy can influence the reliability of a system eg by preventive andor predictive maintenance although it can never bring it above the inherent reliability The reliability plan should clearly provide a strategy for availability control Whether only availability or also cost of ownership is more important depends on the use of the system For example a system that is a critical link in a production systemeg a big oil platformis normally allowed to have a very high cost of ownership if that cost translates to even a minor increase in availability as the unavailability of the platform results in a massive loss of revenue which can easily exceed the high cost of ownership A proper reliability plan should always address RAMT analysis in its total context RAMT stands for reliability availability maintainabilitymaintenance and testability in the context of the customers needs Reliability requirements edit For any system one of the first tasks of reliability engineering is to adequately specify the reliability and maintainability requirements allocated from the overall availability needs and more importantly derived from proper design failure analysis or preliminary prototype test results Clear requirements able to designed to should constrain the designers from designing particular unreliable items constructions interfaces systems Setting only availability reliability testability or maintainability targets eg max failure rates is not appropriate This is a broad misunderstanding about Reliability Requirements Engineering Reliability requirements address the system itself including test and assessment requirements and associated tasks and documentation Reliability requirements are included in the appropriate system or subsystem requirements specifications test plans and contract statements Creation of proper lowerlevel requirements is critical 16 Provision of only quantitative minimum targets eg MTBF values or failure rates is not sufficient for different reasons One reason is that a full validation related to correctness and verifiability in time of a quantitative reliability allocation requirement spec on lower levels for complex systems can often not be made as a consequence of 1 the fact that the requirements are probabilistic 2 the extremely high level of uncertainties involved for showing compliance with all these probabilistic requirements and because 3 reliability is a function of time and accurate estimates of a probabilistic reliability number per item are available only very late in the project sometimes even after many years of inservice use Compare this problem with the continuous rebalancing of for example lowerlevelsystem mass requirements in the development of an aircraft which is already often a big undertaking Notice that in this case masses do only differ in terms of only some are not a function of time the data is nonprobabilistic and available already in CAD models In case of reliability the levels of unreliability failure rates may change with factors of decades multiples of 10 as result of very minor deviations in design process or anything else 17 The information is often not available without huge uncertainties within the development phase This makes this allocation problem almost impossible to do in a useful practical valid manner that does not result in massive over or underspecification A pragmatic approach is therefore neededfor example the use of general levels classes of quantitative requirements depending only on severity of failure effects Also the validation of results is a far more subjective task than for any other type of requirement Quantitative reliability parametersin terms of MTBFare by far the most uncertain design parameters in any design Furthermore reliability design requirements should drive a system or part design to incorporate features that prevent failures from occurring or limit consequences from failure in the first place Not only would it aid in some predictions this effort would keep from distracting the engineering effort into a kind of accounting work A design requirement should be precise enough so that a designer can design to it and can also provethrough analysis or testingthat the requirement has been achieved and if possible within some a stated confidence Any type of reliability requirement should be detailed and could be derived from failure analysis FiniteElement Stress and Fatigue analysis Reliability Hazard Analysis FTA FMEA Human Factor Analysis Functional Hazard Analysis etc or any type of reliability testing Also requirements are needed for verification tests eg required overload stresses and test time needed To derive these requirements in an effective manner a systems engineering based risk assessment and mitigation logic should be used Robust hazard log systems must be created that contain detailed information on why and how systems could or have failed Requirements are to be derived and tracked in this way These practical design requirements shall drive the design and not be used only for verification purposes These requirements often design constraints are in this way derived from failure analysis or preliminary tests Understanding of this difference compared to only purely quantitative logistic requirement specification eg Failure Rate MTBF target is paramount in the development of successful complex systems 18 The maintainability requirements address the costs of repairs as well as repair time Testability not to be confused with test requirements requirements provide the link between reliability and maintainability and should address detectability of failure modes on a particular system level isolation levels and the creation of diagnostics proceduresAs indicated above reliability engineers should also address requirements for various reliability tasks and documentation during system development testing production and operation These requirements are generally specified in the contract statement of work and depend on how much leeway the customer wishes to provide to the contractor Reliability tasks include various analyses planning and failure reporting Task selection depends on the criticality of the system as well as cost A safetycritical system may require a formal failure reporting and review process throughout development whereas a noncritical system may rely on final test reports The most common reliability program tasks are documented in reliability program standards such as MILSTD785 and IEEE 1332 Failure reporting analysis and corrective action systems are a common approach for productprocess reliability monitoring Reliability culture human errors human factors edit In practice most failures can be traced back to some type of human error for example in Management decisions eg in budgeting timing and required tasks Systems Engineering Use studies load cases Systems Engineering Requirement analysis setting Systems Engineering Configuration control Assumptions Calculations simulations FEM analysis Design Design drawings Testing eg incorrect load settings or failure measurement Statistical analysis Manufacturing Quality control Maintenance Maintenance manuals Training Classifying and ordering of information Feedback of field information eg incorrect or too vague etc However humans are also very good at detecting such failures correcting for them and improvising when abnormal situations occur Therefore policies that completely rule out human actions in design and production processes to improve reliability may not be effective Some tasks are better performed by humans and some are better performed by machines 19 Furthermore human errors in management the organization of data and information or the misuse or abuse of items may also contribute to unreliability This is the core reason why high levels of reliability for complex systems can only be achieved by following a robust systems engineering process with proper planning and execution of the validation and verification tasks This also includes careful organization of data and information sharing and creating a reliability culture in the same way that having a safety culture is paramount in the development of safety critical systems Reliability prediction and improvement edit See also Risk Assessment Quantitative risk assessment Reliability prediction combines creation of a proper reliability model see further on this page estimation and justification of input parameters for this model eg failure rates for a particular failure mode or event and the mean time to repair the system for a particular failure estimation of output reliability parameters at system or part level ie system availability or frequency of a particular functional failure The emphasis on quantification and target setting eg MTBF might imply there is a limit to achievable reliability however there is no inherent limit and development of higher reliability does not need to be more costly In addition they argue that prediction of reliability from historic data can be very misleading with comparisons only valid for identical designs products manufacturing processes and maintenance with identical operating loads and usage environments Even minor changes in any of these could have major effects on reliability Furthermore the most unreliable and important items ie the most interesting candidates for a reliability investigation are most likely to be modified and reengineered since historical data was gathered making the standard reactive or proactive statistical methods and processes used in eg medical or insurance industries less effective Another surprising but logical argument is that to be able to accurately predict reliability by testing the exact mechanisms of failure must be known and therefore in most cases could be prevented Following the incorrect route of trying to quantify and solve a complex reliability engineering problem in terms of MTBF or probability using anincorrect for example the reactive approach is referred to by Barnard as Playing the Numbers Game and is regarded as bad practice 5 For existing systems it is arguable that any attempt by a responsible program to correct the root cause of discovered failures may render the initial MTBF estimate invalid as new assumptions themselves subject to high error levels of the effect of this correction must be made Another practical issue is the general unavailability of detailed failure data with those available often featuring inconsistent filtering of failure feedback data and ignoring statistical errors which are very high for rare events like reliability related failures Very clear guidelines must be present to count and compare failures related to different type of rootcauses eg manufacturing maintenance transport systeminduced or inherent design failures Comparing different types of causes may lead to incorrect estimations and incorrect business decisions about the focus of improvement To perform a proper quantitative reliability prediction for systems may be difficult and very expensive if done by testing At the individual partlevel reliability results can often be obtained with comparatively high confidence as testing of many sample parts might be possible using the available testing budget However unfortunately these tests may lack validity at a systemlevel due to assumptions made at partlevel testing These authors emphasized the importance of initial part or systemlevel testing until failure and to learn from such failures to improve the system or part The general conclusion is drawn that an accurate and absolute prediction by either fielddata comparison or testing of reliability is in most cases not possible An exception might be failures due to wearout problems such as fatigue failures In the introduction of MILSTD785 it is written that reliability prediction should be used with great caution if not used solely for comparison in tradeoff studies Design for reliability edit Design for Reliability DfR is a process that encompasses tools and procedures to ensure that a product meets its reliability requirements under its use environment for the duration of its lifetime DfR is implemented in the design stage of a product to proactively improve product reliability 20 DfR is often used as part of an overall Design for Excellence DfX strategy Statisticsbased approach ie MTBF edit Reliability design begins with the development of a system model Reliability and availability models use block diagrams and Fault Tree Analysis to provide a graphical means of evaluating the relationships between different parts of the system These models may incorporate predictions based on failure rates taken from historical data While the input data predictions are often not accurate in an absolute sense they are valuable to assess relative differences in design alternatives Maintainability parameters for example Mean time to repair MTTR can also be used as inputs for such models The most important fundamental initiating causes and failure mechanisms are to be identified and analyzed with engineering tools A diverse set of practical guidance as to performance and reliability should be provided to designers so that they can generate lowstressed designs and products that protect or are protected against damage and excessive wear Proper validation of input loads requirements may be needed in addition to verification for reliability performance by testing A fault tree diagram One of the most important design techniques is redundancy This means that if one part of the system fails there is an alternate success path such as a backup system The reason why this is the ultimate design choice is related to the fact that highconfidence reliability evidence for new parts or systems is often not available or is extremely expensive to obtain By combining redundancy together with a high level of failure monitoring and the avoidance of common cause failures even a system with relatively poor singlechannel part reliability can be made highly reliable at a system level up to mission critical reliability No testing of reliability has to be required for this In conjunction with redundancy the use of dissimilar designs or manufacturing processes eg via different suppliers of similar parts for single independent channels can provide less sensitivity to quality issues eg early childhood failures at a single supplier allowing veryhigh levels of reliability to be achieved at all moments of the development cycle from early life to longterm Redundancy can also be applied in systems engineering by double checking requirements data designs calculations software and tests to overcome systematic failures Another effective way to deal with reliability issues is to perform analysis that predicts degradation enabling the prevention of unscheduled downtime events failures RCM Reliability Centered Maintenance programs can be used for this Physicsoffailurebased approach edit For electronic assemblies there has been an increasing shift towards a different approach called physics of failure This technique relies on understanding the physical static and dynamic failure mechanisms It accounts for variation in load strength and stress that lead to failure with a high level of detail made possible with the use of modern finite element method FEM software programs that can handle complex geometries and mechanisms such as creep stress relaxation fatigue and probabilistic design Monte Carlo Methods DOE The material or component can be redesigned to reduce the probability of failure and to make it more robust against such variations Another common design technique is component derating ie selecting components whose specifications significantly exceed the expected stress levels such as using heavier gauge electrical wire than might normally be specified for the expected electric current Common tools and techniques edit Many of the tasks techniques and analyses used in Reliability Engineering are specific to particular industries and applications but can commonly include Physics of failure PoF Builtin selftest BIT testability analysis Failure mode and effects analysis FMEA Reliability hazard analysis Reliability blockdiagram analysis Dynamic reliability blockdiagram analysis 21 Fault tree analysis Root cause analysis Statistical engineering design of experiments eg on simulations FEM models or with testing Sneak circuit analysis Accelerated testing Reliability growth analysis reactive reliability Weibull analysis for testing or mainly reactive reliability Thermal analysis by finite element analysis FEA and or measurement Thermal induced shock and vibration fatigue analysis by FEA and or measurement Electromagnetic analysis Avoidance of single point of failure SPOF Functional analysis and functional failure analysis eg function FMEA FHA or FFA Predictive and preventive maintenance reliability centered maintenance RCM analysis Testability analysis Failure diagnostics analysis normally also incorporated in FMEA Human error analysis Operational hazard analysis PreventativePlanned Maintenance Optimization PMO Manual screening Integrated logistics support Results from these methods are presented during reviews of part or system design and logistics Reliability is just one requirement among many for a complex part or system Engineering tradeoff studies are used to determine the optimum balance between reliability requirements and other constraints The importance of language edit Reliability engineers whether using quantitative or qualitative methods to describe a failure or hazard rely on language to pinpoint the risks and enable issues to be solved The language used must help create an orderly description of the functionitemsystem and its complex surrounding as it relates to the failure of these functionsitemssystems Systems engineering is very much about finding the correct words to describe the problem and related risks so that they can be readily solved via engineering solutions Jack Ring said that a systems engineers job is to language the project Ring et al 2000 22 For partsystem failures reliability engineers should concentrate more on the why and how rather that predicting when Understanding why a failure has occurred eg due to overstressed components or manufacturing issues is far more likely to lead to improvement in the designs and processes used 4 than quantifying when a failure is likely to occur eg via determining MTBF To do this first the reliability hazards relating to the partsystem need to be classified and ordered based on some form of qualitative and quantitative logic if possible to allow for more efficient assessment and eventual improvement This is partly done in pure language and proposition logic but also based on experience with similar items This can for example be seen in descriptions of events in fault tree analysis FMEA analysis and hazard tracking logs In this sense language and proper grammar part of qualitative analysis plays an important role in reliability engineering just like it does in safety engineering or ingeneral within systems engineering Correct use of language can also be key to identifying or reducing the risks of human error which are often the root cause of many failures This can include proper instructions in maintenance manuals operation manuals emergency procedures and others to prevent systematic human errors that may result in system failures These should be written by trained or experienced technical authors using socalled simplified English or Simplified Technical English where words and structure are specifically chosen and created so as to reduce ambiguity or risk of confusion eg an replace the old part could ambiguously refer to a swapping a wornout part with a non wornout part or replacing a part with one using a more recent and hopefully improved design Reliability modeling edit Reliability modeling is the process of predicting or understanding the reliability of a component or system prior to its implementation Two types of analysis that are often used to model a complete systems availability behavior including effects from logistics issues like spare part provisioning transport and manpower are Fault Tree Analysis and reliability block diagrams At a component level the same types of analyses can be used together with others The input for the models can come from many sources including testing prior operational experience field data as well as data handbooks from similar or related industries Regardless of source all model input data must be used with great caution as predictions are only valid in cases where the same product was used in the same context As such predictions are often only used to help compare alternatives A reliability block diagram showing a 1oo3 1 out of 3 redundant designed subsystem For part level predictions two separate fields of investigation are common The physics of failure approach uses an understanding of physical failure mechanisms involved such as mechanical crack propagation or chemical corrosion degradation or failure The parts stress modeling approach is an empirical method for prediction based on counting the number and type of components of the system and the stress they undergo during operation Software reliability is a more challenging area that must be considered when computer code provides a considerable component of a systems functionality Reliability theory edit Main articles Failure rate and Survival analysis Reliability is defined as the probability that a device will perform its intended function during a specified period of time under stated conditions Mathematically this may be expressed as R t P r T t t f x d x displaystyle RtPrTtint tinfty fxdx where f x displaystyle fx is the failure probability density function and t displaystyle t is the length of the period of time which is assumed to start from time zero There are a few key elements of this definition Reliability is predicated on intended function Generally this is taken to mean operation without failure However even if no individual part of the system fails but the system as a whole does not do what was intended then it is still charged against the system reliability The system requirements specification is the criterion against which reliability is measured Reliability applies to a specified period of time In practical terms this means that a system has a specified chance that it will operate without failure before time t displaystyle t Reliability engineering ensures that components and materials will meet the requirements during the specified time Note that units other than time may sometimes be used eg a mission operation cycles Reliability is restricted to operation under stated or explicitly defined conditions This constraint is necessary because it is impossible to design a system for unlimited conditions A Mars Rover will have different specified conditions than a family car The operating environment must be addressed during design and testing That same rover may be required to operate in varying conditions requiring additional scrutiny Two notable references on reliability theory and its mathematical and statistical foundations are Barlow R E and Proschan F 1982 and Samaniego F J 2007 Quantitative system reliability parameterstheory edit Quantitative requirements are specified using reliability parameters The most common reliability parameter is the mean time to failure MTTF which can also be specified as the failure rate this is expressed as a frequency or conditional probability density function PDF or the number of failures during a given period These parameters may be useful for higher system levels and systems that are operated frequently ie vehicles machinery and electronic equipment Reliability increases as the MTTF increases The MTTF is usually specified in hours but can also be used with other units of measurement such as miles or cycles Using MTTF values on lower system levels can be very misleading especially if they do not specify the associated Failures Modes and Mechanisms The F in MTTF 17 In other cases reliability is specified as the probability of mission success For example reliability of a scheduled aircraft flight can be specified as a dimensionless probability or a percentage as often used in system safety engineering A special case of mission success is the singleshot device or system These are devices or systems that remain relatively dormant and only operate once Examples include automobile airbags thermal batteries and missiles Singleshot reliability is specified as a probability of onetime success or is subsumed into a related parameter Singleshot missile reliability may be specified as a requirement for the probability of a hit For such systems the probability of failure on demand PFD is the reliability measure this is actually an unavailability number The PFD is derived from failure rate a frequency of occurrence and mission time for nonrepairable systems For repairable systems it is obtained from failure rate meantimetorepair MTTR and test interval This measure may not be unique for a given system as this measure depends on the kind of demand In addition to system level requirements reliability requirements may be specified for critical subsystems In most cases reliability parameters are specified with appropriate statistical confidence intervals Reliability testing edit The purpose of reliability testing is to discover potential problems with the design as early as possible and ultimately provide confidence that the system meets its reliability requirements Reliability testing may be performed at several levels and there are different types of testing Complex systems may be tested at component circuit board unit assembly subsystem and system levels 23 The test level nomenclature varies among applications For example performing environmental stress screening tests at lower levels such as piece parts or small assemblies catches problems before they cause failures at higher levels Testing proceeds during each level of integration through fullup system testing developmental testing and operational testing thereby reducing program risk However testing does not mitigate unreliability risk With each test both a statistical type 1 and type 2 error could be made and depends on sample size test time assumptions and the needed discrimination ratio There is risk of incorrectly accepting a bad design type 1 error and the risk of incorrectly rejecting a good design type 2 error It is not always feasible to test all system requirements Some systems are prohibitively expensive to test some failure modes may take years to observe some complex interactions result in a huge number of possible test cases and some tests require the use of limited test ranges or other resources In such cases different approaches to testing can be used such as highly accelerated life testing design of experiments and simulations The desired level of statistical confidence also plays a role in reliability testing Statistical confidence is increased by increasing either the test time or the number of items tested Reliability test plans are designed to achieve the specified reliability at the specified confidence level with the minimum number of test units and test time Different test plans result in different levels of risk to the producer and consumer The desired reliability statistical confidence and risk levels for each side influence the ultimate test plan The customer and developer should agree in advance on how reliability requirements will be tested A key aspect of reliability testing is to define failure Although this may seem obvious there are many situations where it is not clear whether a failure is really the fault of the system Variations in test conditions operator differences weather and unexpected situations create differences between the customer and the system developer One strategy to address this issue is to use a scoring conference process A scoring conference includes representatives from the customer the developer the test organization the reliability organization and sometimes independent observers The scoring conference process is defined in the statement of work Each test case is considered by the group and scored as a success or failure This scoring is the official result used by the reliability engineer As part of the requirements phase the reliability engineer develops a test strategy with the customer The test strategy makes tradeoffs between the needs of the reliability organization which wants as much data as possible and constraints such as cost schedule and available resources Test plans and procedures are developed for each reliability test and results are documented Reliability testing is common in the Photonics industry Examples of reliability tests of lasers are life test and burnin These tests consist of the highly accelerated aging under controlled conditions of a group of lasers The data collected from these life tests are used to predict laser life expectancy under the intended operating characteristics 24 Reliability test requirements edit Reliability test requirements can follow from any analysis for which the first estimate of failure probability failure mode or effect needs to be justified Evidence can be generated with some level of confidence by testing With softwarebased systems the probability is a mix of software and hardwarebased failures Testing reliability requirements is problematic for several reasons A single test is in most cases insufficient to generate enough statistical data Multiple tests or longduration tests are usually very expensive Some tests are simply impractical and environmental conditions can be hard to predict over a systems lifecycle Reliability engineering is used to design a realistic and affordable test program that provides empirical evidence that the system meets its reliability requirements Statistical confidence levels are used to address some of these concerns A certain parameter is expressed along with a corresponding confidence level for example an MTBF of 1000 hours at 90 confidence level From this specification the reliability engineer can for example design a test with explicit criteria for the number of hours and number of failures until the requirement is met or failed Different sorts of tests are possible The combination of required reliability level and required confidence level greatly affects the development cost and the risk to both the customer and producer Care is needed to select the best combination of requirementseg costeffectiveness Reliability testing may be performed at various levels such as component subsystem and system Also many factors must be addressed during testing and operation such as extreme temperature and humidity shock vibration or other environmental factors like loss of signal cooling or power or other catastrophes such as fire floods excessive heat physical or security violations or other myriad forms of damage or degradation For systems that must last many years accelerated life tests may be needed Accelerated testing edit The purpose of accelerated life testing ALT test is to induce field failure in the laboratory at a much faster rate by providing a harsher but nonetheless representative environment In such a test the product is expected to fail in the lab just as it would have failed in the fieldbut in much less timeThe main objective of an accelerated test is either of the following To discover failure modes To predict the normal field life from the high stress lab life An Accelerated testing program can be broken down into the following steps Define objective and scope of the test Collect required information about the product Identify the stresses Determine level of stresses Conduct the accelerated test and analyze the collected data Common ways to determine a life stress relationship are Arrhenius model Eyring model Inverse power law model Temperaturehumidity model Temperature nonthermal model Software reliability edit Further information Software reliability and Site reliability engineering Software reliability is a special aspect of reliability engineering System reliability by definition includes all parts of the system including hardware software supporting infrastructure including critical external interfaces operators and procedures Traditionally reliability engineering focuses on critical hardware parts of the system Since the widespread use of digital integrated circuit technology software has become an increasingly critical part of most electronics and hence nearly all present day systems There are significant differences however in how software and hardware behave Most hardware unreliability is the result of a component or material failure that results in the system not performing its intended function Repairing or replacing the hardware component restores the system to its original operating state However software does not fail in the same sense that hardware fails Instead software unreliability is the result of unanticipated results of software operations Even relatively small software programs can have astronomically large combinations of inputs and states that are infeasible to exhaustively test Restoring software to its original state only works until the same combination of inputs and states results in the same unintended result Software reliability engineering must take this into account Despite this difference in the source of failure between software and hardware several software reliability models based on statistics have been proposed to quantify what we experience with software the longer software is run the higher the probability that it will eventually be used in an untested manner and exhibit a latent defect that results in a failure Shooman 1987 Musa 2005 Denney 2005 As with hardware software reliability depends on good requirements design and implementation Software reliability engineering relies heavily on a disciplined software engineering process to anticipate and design against unintended consequences There is more overlap between software quality engineering and software reliability engineering than between hardware quality and reliability A good software development plan is a key aspect of the software reliability program The software development plan describes the design and coding standards peer reviews unit tests configuration management software metrics and software models to be used during software development A common reliability metric is the number of software faults usually expressed as faults per thousand lines of code This metric along with software execution time is key to most software reliability models and estimates The theory is that the software reliability increases as the number of faults or fault density decreases Establishing a direct connection between fault density and meantimebetweenfailure is difficult however because of the way software faults are distributed in the code their severity and the probability of the combination of inputs necessary to encounter the fault Nevertheless fault density serves as a useful indicator for the reliability engineer Other software metrics such as complexity are also used This metric remains controversial since changes in software development and verification practices can have dramatic impact on overall defect rates Testing is even more important for software than hardware Even the best software development process results in some software faults that are nearly undetectable until tested As with hardware software is tested at several levels starting with individual units through integration and fullup system testing Unlike hardware it is inadvisable to skip levels of software testing During all phases of testing software faults are discovered corrected and retested Reliability estimates are updated based on the fault density and other metrics At a system level meantimebetweenfailure data can be collected and used to estimate reliability Unlike hardware performing exactly the same test on exactly the same software configuration does not provide increased statistical confidence Instead software reliability uses different metrics such as code coverage Eventually the software is integrated with the hardware in the toplevel system and software reliability is subsumed by system reliability The Software Engineering Institutes capability maturity model is a common means of assessing the overall software development process for reliability and quality purposes Structural reliability edit Main article Structural reliability Structural reliability or the reliability of structures is the application of reliability theory to the behavior of structures It is used in both the design and maintenance of different types of structures including concrete and steel structures 25 26 In structural reliability studies both loads and resistances are modeled as probabilistic variables Using this approach the probability of failure of a structure is calculated Comparison to safety engineering edit Reliability for safety and reliability for availability are often closely related Lost availability of an engineering system can cost money If a subway system is unavailable the subway operator will lose money for each hour the system is down The subway operator will lose more money if safety is compromised The definition of reliability is tied to a probability of not encountering a failure A failure can cause loss of safety loss of availability or both It is undesirable to lose safety or availability in a critical system Reliability engineering is concerned with overall minimisation of failures that could lead to financial losses for the responsible entity whereas safety engineering focuses on minimising a specific set of failure types that in general could lead to loss of life injury or damage to equipment Reliability hazards could transform into incidents leading to a loss of revenue for the company or the customer for example due to direct and indirect costs associated with loss of production due to system unavailability unexpected high or low demands for spares repair costs manhours multiple redesigns interruptions to normal production etc 27 Safety engineering is often highly specific relating only to certain tightly regulated industries applications or areas It primarily focuses on system safety hazards that could lead to severe accidents including loss of life destruction of equipment or environmental damage As such the related system functional reliability requirements are often extremely high Although it deals with unwanted failures in the same sense as reliability engineering it however has less of a focus on direct costs and is not concerned with postfailure repair actions Another difference is the level of impact of failures on society leading to a tendency for strict control by governments or regulatory bodies eg nuclear aerospace defense rail and oil industries 27 This can occasionally lead to safety engineering and reliability engineering having contradictory requirements or conflicting choices at a system architecture level citation needed For example in train signal control systems it is common practice to use a failsafe system design concept In this example a wrongside failure needs an extremely low failure rate as such failures can lead to such severe effects like frontal collisions of two trains where a signalling failure leads to two oncoming trains on the same track being given GREEN lights Such systems should be and thankfully are designed in a way that the vast majority of failures eg temporary or total loss of signals or open contacts of relays will generate RED lights for all trains This is the safe state This means in the event of a failure all trains are stopped immediately This failsafe logic might unfortunately lower the reliability of the system The reason for this is the higher risk of false tripping as any failure whether temporary or not may be trigger such a safe but costly shutdown state Different solutions can be applied for similar issues See the section on fault tolerance below Fault tolerance edit Main article Fault tolerance Safety can be increased using a 2oo2 cross checked redundant system Availability can be increased by using 1oo2 1 out of 2 redundancy at a part or system level If both redundant elements disagree the more permissive element will maximize availability A 1oo2 system should never be relied on for safety Faulttolerant systems often rely on additional redundancy eg 2oo3 voting logic where multiple redundant elements must agree on a potentially unsage action before it is performed This increases both availability and safety at a system level This is common practice in Aerospace systems that need continued availability and do not have a failsafe mode For example aircraft may use triple modular redundancy for flight computers and control surfaces including occasionally different modes of operation eg electricalmechanicalhydraulic as these need to always be operational due to the fact that there are no safe default positions for control surfaces such as rudders or ailerons when the aircraft is flying Basic reliability and mission operational reliability edit The above example of a 2oo3 fault tolerant system increases both mission reliability as well as safety However the basic reliability of the system will in this case still be lower than a nonredundant 1oo1 or 2oo2 system Basic reliability engineering covers all failures including those that might not result in system failure but do result in additional cost due to maintenance repair actions logistics spare parts etc For example replacement or repair of 1 faulty channel in a 2oo3 voting system the system is still operating although with one failed channel it has actually become a 2oo2 system is contributing to basic unreliability but not mission unreliability As an example the failure of the taillight of an aircraft will not prevent the plane from flying and so is not considered a mission failure but it does need to be remedied with a related cost and so does contribute to the basic unreliability levels Detectability and common cause failures edit When using fault tolerant redundant architectures systems or systems that are equipped with protection functions detectability of failures and avoidance of common cause failures becomes paramount for safe functioning andor mission reliability Reliability versus quality Six Sigma edit Quality often focuses on manufacturing defects during the warranty phase Reliability looks at the failure intensity over the whole life of a product or engineering system from commissioning to decommissioning Six Sigma has its roots in statistical control in quality of manufacturing Reliability engineering is a specialty part of systems engineering The systems engineering process is a discovery process that is often unlike a manufacturing process A manufacturing process is often focused on repetitive activities that achieve high quality outputs with minimum cost and time 28 The everyday usage term quality of a product is loosely taken to mean its inherent degree of excellence In industry a more precise definition of quality as conformance to requirements or specifications at the start of use is used Assuming the final product specification adequately captures the original requirements and customersystem needs the quality level can be measured as the fraction of product units shipped that meet specifications 29 Manufactured goods quality often focuses on the number of warranty claims during the warranty period Quality is a snapshot at the start of life through the warranty period and is related to the control of lowerlevel product specifications This includes timezero defects ie where manufacturing mistakes escaped final Quality Control In theory the quality level might be described by a single fraction of defective products Reliability as a part of systems engineering acts as more of an ongoing assessment of failure rates over many years Theoretically all items will fail over an infinite period of time 30 Defects that appear over time are referred to as reliability fallout To describe reliability fallout a probability model that describes the fraction fallout over time is needed This is known as the life distribution model 29 Some of these reliability issues may be due to inherent design issues which may exist even though the product conforms to specifications Even items that are produced perfectly will fail over time due to one or more failure mechanisms eg due to human error or mechanical electrical and chemical factors These reliability issues can also be influenced by acceptable levels of variation during initial production Quality and reliability are therefore related to manufacturing Reliability is more targeted towards clients who are focused on failures throughout the whole life of the product such as the military airlines or railroads Items that do not conform to product specification will generally do worse in terms of reliability having a lower MTTF but this does not always have to be the case The full mathematical quantification in statistical models of this combined relation is in general very difficult or even practically impossible In cases where manufacturing variances can be effectively reduced six sigma tools have been shown to be useful to find optimal process solutions which can increase quality and reliability Six Sigma may also help to design products that are more robust to manufacturing induced failures and infant mortality defects in engineering systems and manufactured product In contrast with Six Sigma reliability engineering solutions are generally found by focusing on reliability testing and system design Solutions are found in different ways such as by simplifying a system to allow more of the mechanisms of failure involved to be understood performing detailed calculations of material stress levels allowing suitable safety factors to be determined finding possible abnormal system load conditions and using this to increase robustness of a design to manufacturing variance related failure mechanisms Furthermore reliability engineering uses systemlevel solutions like designing redundant and faulttolerant systems for situations with high availability needs see Reliability engineering vs Safety engineering above Note A defect in sixsigmaquality literature is not the same as a failure Field failure eg fractured item in reliability A sixsigmaquality defect refers generally to nonconformance with a requirement eg basic functionality or a key dimension Items can however fail over time even if these requirements are all fulfilled Quality is generally not concerned with asking the crucial question are the requirements actually correct whereas reliability is Reliability operational assessment edit Once systems or parts are being produced reliability engineering attempts to monitor assess and correct deficiencies Monitoring includes electronic and visual surveillance of critical parameters identified during the fault tree analysis design stage Data collection is highly dependent on the nature of the system Most large organizations have quality control groups that collect failure data on vehicles equipment and machinery Consumer product failures are often tracked by the number of returns For systems in dormant storage or on standby it is necessary to establish a formal surveillance program to inspect and test random samples Any changes to the system such as field upgrades or recall repairs require additional reliability testing to ensure the reliability of the modification Since it is not possible to anticipate all the failure modes of a given system especially ones with a human element failures will occur The reliability program also includes a systematic root cause analysis that identifies the causal relationships involved in the failure such that effective corrective actions may be implemented When possible system failures and corrective actions are reported to the reliability engineering organization Some of the most common methods to apply to a reliability operational assessment are failure reporting analysis and corrective action systems FRACAS This systematic approach develops a reliability safety and logistics assessment based on failureincident reporting management analysis and correctivepreventive actions Organizations today are adopting this method and utilizing commercial systems such as Webbased FRACAS applications that enable them to create a failureincident data repository from which statistics can be derived to view accurate and genuine reliability safety and quality metrics It is extremely important for an organization to adopt a common FRACAS system for all end items Also it should allow test results to be captured in a practical way Failure to adopt one easytouse in terms of ease of dataentry for field engineers and repair shop engineers and easytomaintain integrated system is likely to result in a failure of the FRACAS program itself Some of the common outputs from a FRACAS system include Field MTBF MTTR spares consumption reliability growth failureincidents distribution by type location part no serial no and symptom The use of past data to predict the reliability of new comparable systemsitems can be misleading as reliability is a function of the context of use and can be affected by small changes in designmanufacturing Reliability organizations edit Systems of any significant complexity are developed by organizations of people such as a commercial company or a government agency The reliability engineering organization must be consistent with the companys organizational structure For small noncritical systems reliability engineering may be informal As complexity grows the need arises for a formal reliability function Because reliability is important to the customer the customer may even specify certain aspects of the reliability organization There are several common types of reliability organizations The project manager or chief engineer may employ one or more reliability engineers directly In larger organizations there is usually a product assurance or specialty engineering organization which may include reliability maintainability quality safety human factors logistics etc In such case the reliability engineer reports to the product assurance manager or specialty engineering manager In some cases a company may wish to establish an independent reliability organization This is desirable to ensure that the system reliability which is often expensive and timeconsuming is not unduly slighted due to budget and schedule pressures In such cases the reliability engineer works for the project daytoday but is actually employed and paid by a separate organization within the company Because reliability engineering is critical to early system design it has become common for reliability engineers however the organization is structured to work as part of an integrated product team Education edit Some universities offer graduate degrees in reliability engineering Other reliability professionals typically have a physics degree from a university or college program Many engineering programs offer reliability courses and some universities have entire reliability engineering programs A reliability engineer must be registered as a professional engineer by the state or province by law but not all reliability professionals are engineers Reliability engineers are required in systems where public safety is at risk There are many professional conferences and industry training programs available for reliability engineers Several professional organizations exist for reliability engineers including the American Society for Quality Reliability Division ASQRD 31 the IEEE Reliability Society the American Society for Quality ASQ 32 and the Society of Reliability Engineers SRE 33 A group of engineers have provided a list of useful tools for reliability engineering These include PTC Windchill software RAM Commander software RelCalc software Military Handbook 217 MilHDBK217 217Plus and the NAVMAT P48551A manual Analyzing failures and successes coupled with a quality standards process also provides systemized information
