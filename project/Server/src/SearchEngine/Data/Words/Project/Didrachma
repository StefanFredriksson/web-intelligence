derived from the verb δράσσομαι drássomai I grasp n 3 It is believed that the same word with the meaning of handful or handle is found in Linear B tablets of the Mycenean Pylos 3 n 4 Initially a drachma was a fistful a grasp of six oboloí or obeloí metal sticks literally spits used as a form of currency as early as 1100BC and being a form of bullion bronze copper or iron ingots denominated by weight A hoard of over 150 rodshaped obeloi was uncovered at Heraion of Argos in Peloponnese Six of them are displayed at the Numismatic Museum of Athens It was the standard unit of silver coinage at most ancient Greek mints and the name obol was used to describe a coin that was onesixth of a drachma The notion that drachma derived from the word for fistful was recorded by Herakleides of Pontos 387312BC who was informed by the priests of Heraion that Pheidon king of Argos dedicated rodshaped obeloi to Heraion Similar information about Pheidons obeloi was also recorded at the Parian Chronicle Ancient Greek coins normally had distinctive names in daily use The Athenian tetradrachm was called owl 6 the Aeginetic stater was called chelone the Corinthian stater was called hippos horse and so on Each city would mint its own and have them stamped with recognizable symbols of the city known as badge in numismatics along with suitable inscriptions and they would often be referred to either by the name of the city or of the image depicted The exact exchange value of each was determined by the quantity and quality of the metal which reflected on the reputation of each mint Among the Greek cities that used the drachma were Abdera Abydos Alexandria Aetna Antioch Athens Chios Cyzicus Corinth Ephesus Eretria Gela Catana Kos Maronia Naxos Pella Pergamum Rhegion Salamis Smyrni Sparta Syracuse Tarsus Thasos Tenedos Troy and more The 5th century BC Athenian tetradrachm four drachmae coin was perhaps the most widely used coin in the Greek world prior to the time of Alexander the Great along with the Corinthian stater It featured the helmeted profile bust of Athena on the obverse front and an owl on the reverse back In daily use they were called γλαῦκες glaukes owls 7 hence the proverb Γλαῦκ Ἀθήναζε an owl to Athens referring to something that was in plentiful supply like coals to Newcastle The reverse is featured on the national side of the modern Greek 1 euro coin Drachmae were minted on different weight standards at different Greek mints The standard that came to be most commonly used was the Athenian or Attic one which weighed a little over 43grams After Alexander the Great s conquests the name drachma was used in many of the Hellenistic kingdoms in the Middle East including the Ptolemaic kingdom in Alexandria and the Parthian Empire based in what is modernday Iran The Arabic unit of currency known as dirham Arabic درهم known from pre Islamic times and afterwards inherited its name from the drachma or didrachm δίδραχμον 2 drachmae the dirham is still the name of the official currencies of Morocco and the United Arab Emirates The Armenian dram Armenian Դրամ also derives its name from the drachma Value edit It is difficult to estimate comparative exchange rates with modern currency because the range of products produced by economies of centuries gone by were different from today which makes purchasing power parity PPP calculations very difficult however some historians and economists have estimated that in the 5th century BC a drachma had a rough value of 25 US dollars in the year 1990 equivalent to 4650 USD in 2015 8 whereas classical historians regularly say that in the heyday of ancient Greece the fifth and fourth centuries the daily wage for a skilled worker or a hoplite 9 was one drachma and for a heliast juror half a drachma since 425BC 10 Modern commentators derived from Xenophon 11 that half a drachma per day 360 days per year would provide a comfortable subsistence for the poor citizens for the head of a household in 355BC Earlier in 422BC we also see in Aristophanes Wasps line 300302 that the daily halfdrachma of a juror is just enough for the daily subsistence of a family of three A modern person might think of one drachma as the rough equivalent of a skilled workers daily pay in the place where they live which could be as low as US1 or as high as 100 depending on the country Fractions and multiples of the drachma were minted by many states most notably in Ptolemaic Egypt which minted large coins in gold silver and bronze Notable Ptolemaic coins included the gold pentadrachm and octadrachm and silver tetradrachm decadrachm and pentakaidecadrachm This was especially noteworthy as it would not be until the introduction of the Guldengroschen in 1486 that coins of substantial size particularly in silver would be minted in significant quantities For the Roman successors of the drachma see Roman provincial coins Denominations of Ancient Greek drachma edit The weight of the silver drachma was approximately 43 grams or 015 ounces 12 although weights varied significantly from one citystate to another It was divided into six obols of 072 grams which were subdivided into four tetartemoria of 018 grams one of the smallest coins ever struck approximately 57mm in diameter 13 Denominations of silver drachma Image Denomination Value Weight Greek Dekadrachm 10 drachmae 43

drachma edit The drachma was reintroduced in May 1832 shortly before the establishment of the modern state of Greece with the exception of the subdivision Taurus 17 It replaced the phoenix at par The drachma was subdivided into 100 lepta n 7 Coins edit The first coinage consisted of copper denominations of 1 2 5 and 10 lepta silver denominations of 1 4 1 2 1 and 5 drachmae and a gold coin of 20 drachmae The drachma coin weighed 45g and contained 90 silver with the 20drachma coin containing 58g of gold In 1868 Greece joined the Latin Monetary Union and the drachma became equal in weight and value to the French franc The new coinage issued consisted of copper coins of 1 2 5 and 10 lepta with the 5 and 10lepta coins bearing the names obolos ὀβολός and diobolon διώβολον respectively silver coins of 20 and 50 lepta 1 2 and 5 drachmae and gold coins of 5 10 and 20 drachmae Very small numbers of 50 and 100drachma coins in gold were also issued In 1894 cupronickel 5 10 and 20lepta coins were introduced No 1lepton or 2lepta coin had been issued since the late 1870s Silver coins of 1 and 2 drachmae were last issued in 1911 and no coins were issued between 1912 and 1922 during which time the Latin Monetary Union collapsed due to World War I Between 1926 and 1930 a new coinage was introduced for the new Hellenic Republic consisting of cupronickel coins in denominations of 20 lepta 50 lepta 1 drachma and 2 drachmae nickel coins of 5 drachmae and silver coins of 10 and 20 drachmae These were the last coins issued for the first modern drachma and none were issued for the second Notes edit Banknote of 1912 issued by the NBG Notes were issued by the National Bank of Greece from 1841 until 2001 when Greece joined the Euro Early denominations ranged from 10 to 500 drachmae Smaller denominations 1 2 3 and 5 drachmae were issued from 1885 with the first 5drachma notes being made by cutting 10drachma notes in half When Greece finally achieved its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1828 the phoenix was introduced as the monetary unit its use was shortlived however and in 1832 the phoenix was replaced by the drachma adorned with the image of King Otto of Greece who reigned as modern Greeces first king from 1832 to 1862 The drachma was divided into 100 lepta In 2002 the drachma ceased to be legal tender after the euro the monetary unit of the European Union became Greeces sole currency Between 1917 and 1920 the Greek government issued paper money in denominations of 10 lepta 50 lepta 1 drachma 2 drachmae and 5 drachmae The National Bank of Greece introduced 1000drachma notes in 1901 and the Bank of Greece introduced 5000drachma notes in 1928 The economic depression of the 1920s affected many nations around the globe including Greece In 1922 the Greek government issued a forced loan in order to finance their growing budget deficit On April 1 1922 the government decreed that half of all bank notes had to be surrendered and exchanged for 65 bonds The notes were then cut in half with the portion bearing the Greek crown standing in for the bonds while the other half was exchanged for a new issue of central bank notes at half the original value 18 The Greek government again issued notes between 1940 and 1944 in denominations ranging from 50 lepta to 20 drachmae 5 Drachma note that has been cut in half by government for the purpose of issuing bonds During the German Italian occupation of Greece from 1941 to 1944 catastrophic hyperinflation and Nazi looting of the Greek treasury caused much higher denominations to be issued culminating in 100000000000drachma notes in 1944 19 The Italian occupation authorities in the Ionian Islands printed their own currency Ionian drachma Second modern drachma edit In November 1944 after Greece was liberated from Germany old drachmae were exchanged for new ones at the rate of 50000000000 to 1 Only paper money was issued The government issued notes of 1 5 10 and 20 drachmae with the Bank of Greece issuing 50 100 500 1000 5000 and 10000drachma notes This drachma also suffered from high inflation The government later issued 100 500 and 1000drachma notes and the Bank of Greece issued 20000and 50000drachma notes Third modern drachma edit In 1953 in an effort to halt inflation Greece joined the Bretton Woods system In 1954 the drachma was revalued at a rate of 1000 to 1 The new currency was pegged at 30 drachmae 1 United States dollar In 1973 the Bretton Woods System was abolished over the next 25 years the official exchange rate gradually declined reaching 400 drachmae to 1 U S dollar On 1 January 2002 the Greek drachma was officially replaced as the circulating currency by the euro and it has not been legal tender since 1 March 2002 Third modern drachma coins edit
