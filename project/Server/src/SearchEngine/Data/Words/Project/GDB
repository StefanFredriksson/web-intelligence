portable debugger that runs on many Unixlike systems and works for many programming languages including Ada C C ObjectiveC Free Pascal Fortran Go 2 and partially others 3 Contents 1 History 2

edit GDB was first written by Richard Stallman in 1986 as part of his GNU system after his GNU Emacs was reasonably stable 4 GDB is free software released under the GNU General Public License GPL It was modeled after the DBX debugger which came with Berkeley Unix distributions 4 From 1990 to 1993 it was maintained by John Gilmore citation needed Now it is maintained by the GDB Steering Committee which is appointed by the Free Software Foundation 5 Technical details edit Features edit GDB offers extensive facilities for tracing and altering the execution of computer programs The user can monitor and modify the values of programs internal variables and even call functions independently of the programs normal behavior GDB target processors as of 2003 include Alpha ARM AVR H8300 Altera NiosNios II System370 System 390 X86 and its 64bit extension X8664 IA64 Itanium Motorola 68000 MIPS PARISC PowerPC SuperH SPARC and VAX Lesserknown target processors supported in the standard release have included A29K ARC ETRAX CRIS D10V D30V FR30 FRV Intel i960 68HC11 Motorola 88000 MCORE MN10200 MN10300 NS32K Stormy16 and Z8000 Newer releases will likely not support some of these GDB has compiledin simulators for even lesserknown target processors such like M32R or V850 6 GDB is still actively developed As of version 70 new features include support for Python scripting 7 and as of version 78 GNU Guile scripting as well 8 Since version 70 support for reversible debugging allowing a debugging session to step backward much like rewinding a crashed program to see what happened is available 9 Remote debugging edit GDB offers a remote mode often used when debugging embedded systems Remote operation is when GDB runs on one machine and the program being debugged runs on another GDB can communicate to the remote stub that understands GDB protocol through a serial device or TCPIP 10 A stub program can be created by linking to the appropriate stub files provided with GDB which implement the target side of the communication protocol 11 Alternatively gdbserver can be used to remotely debug the program without needing to change it in any way The same mode is also used by KGDB for debugging a running Linux kernel on the source level with gdb With KGDB kernel developers can debug a kernel in much the same way as they debug application programs It makes it possible to place breakpoints in kernel code step through the code and observe variables On architectures where hardware debugging registers are available watchpoints can be set which trigger breakpoints when specified memory addresses are executed or accessed KGDB requires an additional machine which is connected to the machine to be debugged using a serial cable or Ethernet On FreeBSD it is also possible to debug using Firewire direct memory access DMA 12 Graphical user interface edit The debugger does not contain its own graphical user interface and defaults to a commandline interface Several frontends have been built for it such as UltraGDB Xxgdb Data Display Debugger DDD Nemiver KDbg the Xcode debugger GDBtkInsight and HP Wildebeest Debugger GUI WDB GUI IDEs such as Codelite CodeBlocks DevC Geany GNAT Programming Studio GPS KDevelop Qt Creator Lazarus MonoDevelop Eclipse NetBeans and Visual Studio can interface with GDB GNU Emacs has a GUD mode and tools for VIM exist eg clewn These offer facilities similar to debuggers found in IDEs Some other debugging tools have been designed to work with GDB such as memory leak detectors Examples of commands edit gdb program Debug program from the shell run v Run the loaded program with the parameters bt Backtrace in case the program crashed info registers Dump all registers disas pc32 pc32 Disassemble An example session edit Consider the following sourcecode written in C include stdioh include stdlibh include stringh sizet foolen const char s return strlen s int main int argc char argv const char a NULL printf size of a lu n foolen a exit 0 Using the GCC compiler on Linux the code above must be compiled using the g flag in order to include appropriate debug information on the binary generated thus making it possible to inspect it using GDB Assuming that the file containing the code above is named examplec the command for the compilation could be gcc examplec Og g o example And the binary can now be run example Segmentation fault Since the example code when executed generates a segmentation fault GDB can be used to inspect the problem gdb example GNU gdb GDB Fedora 73502011072213fc16 Copyright C 2011 Free Software
