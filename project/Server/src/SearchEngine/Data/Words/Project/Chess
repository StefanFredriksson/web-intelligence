checkered board with 64squares arranged in an 88 grid 1 The game is played by millions of people worldwide Chess is believed to be derived from the Indian game chaturanga sometime before the 7thcentury Chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern strategy games xiangqi Chinese chess janggi Korean chess and shogi Japanese chess Chess reached Europe by the 9thcentury due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania The pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15thcentury the modern rules were standardized in the 19thcentury Play involves no hidden information Each player begins with 16 pieces one king one queen two rooks two knights two bishops and eight pawns Each piece type moves differently with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn The objective is to checkmate note 1 the opponents king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture To this end a players pieces are used to attack and capture the opponents pieces while supporting each other During the game play typically involves exchanging pieces for the opponents similar pieces and finding and engineering opportunities to trade advantageously or to get a better position In addition to checkmate a player wins the game if the opponent resigns or in a timed game runs out of time There are also several ways that a game can end in a draw The first generally recognized World Chess Champion Wilhelm Steinitz claimed his title in 1886 Since 1948 the World Championship has been regulated by the Fédération Internationale des Échecs FIDE the games international governing body FIDE also awards lifetime master titles to skilled players the highest of which is Grandmaster GM Many national chess organizations have a title system of their own FIDE also organizes the Womens World Championship the World Junior Championship the World Senior Championship the Blitz and Rapid World Championships and the Chess Olympiad a popular competition among international teams FIDE is a member of the International Olympic Committee which can be considered recognition of chess as a sport 3 Several national sporting bodies eg the Spanish Consejo Superior de Deportes 4 also recognize chess as a sport Chess was included in the 2006 and 2010 Asian Games There is also a Correspondence Chess World Championship and a World Computer Chess Championship Online chess has opened amateur and professional competition to a wide and varied group of players Since the second half of the 20th century chess engines have been programmed to play with increasing success to the point where the strongest programs play at a higher level than the best human players Since the 1990s computer analysis has contributed significantly to chess theory particularly in the endgame The IBM computer Deep Blue was the first machine to overcome a reigning World Chess Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997 The rise of strong chess engines runnable on handheld devices has led to increasing concern about cheating during tournaments There are many variants of chess that utilize different rules pieces or boards One of these Fischer Random Chess has gained widespread

national governing bodies or by unaffiliated chess organizations commercial publishers etc may differ FIDEs rules were most recently revised in 2018 Setup a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Initial position first bottom row rook knight bishop queen king bishop knight and rook second row pawns Setup at the start of a game By convention chess game pieces are divided into white and black sets Each set consists of 16 pieces one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns The pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black respectively The game is played on a square board of eight rows called ranks denoted 1 to 8 from bottom to top according to Whites perspective and eight columns called files denoted a to h from left to right according to Whites perspective The 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares The chessboard is placed with a light square at the righthand corner nearest to each player Thus each queen starts on a square of its own color the white queen on a light square the black queen on a dark square Movement In competitive games the colors are allocated by the organizers in informal games the colors are usually decided randomly for example by coin toss or by one players concealing a white and black pawn in either hand and having the opponent choose White moves first after which players alternate turns moving one piece per turn except for castling when two pieces are moved A piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponents piece which is captured and removed from play With the sole exception of en passant all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponents piece occupies Moving is compulsory it is illegal to skip a turn even when having to move is detrimental A player may not make any move that would put or leave the players own king in check If the player to move has no legal move the game is over the result is either checkmate a loss for the player with no legal move if the king is in check or stalemate a draw if the king is not Each piece has its own way of moving In the diagrams the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening pieces of either color except the knight which leaps over any intervening pieces Moves of the king a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Moves of a rook a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Moves of a bishop a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4

of a pawn a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h The king moves one square in any direction The king also has a special move called castling that involves also moving a rook A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file but cannot leap over other pieces Along with the king a rook is involved during the kings castling move A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally but cannot leap over other pieces The queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank file or diagonal but cannot leap over other pieces A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank file or diagonal Thus the move forms an Lshape two squares vertically and one square horizontally or two squares horizontally and one square vertically The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied black dots in the diagram or the pawn can capture an opponents piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file by moving to that square black xs A pawn has two special moves the en passant capture and promotion Castling Main article Castling Examples of castling view animation Once in every game each king can make a special move known as castling Castling consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook that is on the players first rank and then placing the rook on the last square that the king just crossed Castling is permissible if the following conditions are met 6 Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game There are no pieces between the king and the rook The king cannot be in check nor can the king pass through any square that is under attack by an enemy piece or move to a square that would result in check Note that castling is permitted if the rook is under attack or if the rook crosses an attacked square En passant Main article En passant Examples of pawn moves left promotion right en passant When a pawn makes a twostep advance from its starting position and there is an opponents pawn on a square next to the destination square on an adjacent file then the opponents pawn can capture it en passant in passing moving to the square the pawn passed over This can be done only on the very next turn otherwise the right to do so is forfeited For example in the animated diagram the black pawn advances two steps from g7 to g5 and the white pawn on f5 can take it en passant on g6 but only on Whites next move Promotion Main article Promotion chess When a pawn advances to the eighth rank as a part of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the players choice of queen rook bishop or knight of the same color Usually the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen but in some cases another piece is chosen this is called underpromotion In the animated diagram the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted There is no restriction on the piece promoted to so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game eg two or more queens Check Main article Check chess a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h The black king is in check by the rook When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponents pieces it is said to be in check A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check This can involve capturing the checking piece interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen rook or bishop and there is a square between it and the king or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack Castling is not a permissible response to a check The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent this occurs when the opponents king is in check and there is no legal way to remove it from attack It is never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves the players own king in check In casual games it is common to announce check when putting the opponents king in check but this is not required by the rules of chess and is not usually done in tournaments End of the game Win a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h White is in checkmate being unable to escape attack by the black bishops Games can be won in the following ways Checkmate The player whose turn it is to move is in check and has no legal move to escape check Resignation Either player may resign conceding the game to the opponent 7 It is usually considered poor etiquette to play on in a hopeless position and for this reason highlevel games rarely end in checkmate Win on time In games with a time control a player wins if the opponent runs out of time even if the opponent has a superior position as long as the player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent Forfeit A player who cheats violates the rules or violates the rules specified for the particular tournament can be forfeited In highlevel tournaments players have been forfeited for such things as arriving late for the game even by a matter of seconds receiving a call or text on a cell phone refusing to undergo a drug test refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices unsporting behavior eg refusing to shake hands with the opponent Draw a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Black is not in check and has no legal move The result is stalemate There are several ways games can end in a draw Draw by agreement Draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw make a move then start the opponents clock Traditionally players have been allowed to agree to a draw at any point in the game occasionally even without playing a move in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty Stalemate The player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and is not in check Threefold repetition of position This most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage In this situation either player can claim a draw this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition Fiftymove rule If during the previous 50 moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made either player can claim a draw There are several known endgames where it is possible to force a mate but it requires more than 50 moves before a pawn move or capture is made examples include some endgames with two knights against a pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops Historically FIDE has sometimes revised the fiftymove rule to make exceptions for these endgames but these have since been repealed Some correspondence chess organizations do not enforce the fiftymove rule note 2 Fivefold repetition of position Similar to the threefoldrepetition rule but in this case neither player needs to claim the draw thus a tournament director can intervene and declare the game to be drawn This is a relatively recent 2014 addition to the FIDE rules Seventyfivemove rule Similar to the fiftymove rule but as with the fivefold repetition rule this applies independently of claims by the players and allows a tournament director to intervene This rule likewise is a recent addition to the FIDE rules Insufficient material If neither player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent for example if a player has only the king and a knight and the opponent has only the king checkmate is impossible and the game is drawn by this rule On the other hand if both players still have a knight there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate so this rule does not apply Draw on time In games with a time control the game is drawn if a player is out of time and the opponent has no theoretical possibility to checkmate the player Time control A digital chess clock In competition chess games are played with a time control If a players time runs out before the game is completed the game is automatically lost provided the opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate The duration of a game ranges from long or classical games which can take up to seven hours even longer if adjournments are permitted to bullet chess under 3minutes per player for the entire game Intermediate between these are rapid chess games lasting between 20minutes and two hours per game a popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments Time is controlled using a chess clock that has two displays one for each players remaining time Analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks which allow for time controls with increments Time controls are also enforced in correspondence chess competition A typical time control is 50 days for every 10 moves History Main article History of chess Predecessors a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Ashtāpada the uncheckered 88 board sometimes with special marks on which chaturanga was played Chess is believed to have originated in Eastern India c 280550 9 in the Gupta Empire 10 11 12 13 where its early form in the 6thcentury was known as chaturaṅga Sanskrit चतरङग literally four divisions of the military infantry cavalry elephants and chariotry represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn knight bishop and rook respectively Thence it spread eastward and westward along the Silk Road The earliest evidence of chess is found in the nearby Sasanian Persia around 600 where the game came to be known by the name chatrang Chatrang was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia 63344 where it was then named shatranj with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names In Spanish shatranj was rendered as ajedrez alshatranj in Portuguese as xadrez and in Greek as ζατρίκιον zatrikion which comes directly from the Persian chatrang 14 but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian shāh king which was familiar as an exclamation and became the English words check and chess note 3 The oldest archaeological chess artifacts ivory pieces were excavated in ancient Afrasiab todays Samarkand in Uzbekistan central Asia and date to about 760 with some of them possibly older The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to 840850 written by alAdli arRumi 800870 a renowned Arab chess player titled Kitab ashshatranj Book of the chess This is a lost manuscript but referenced in later works The eastern migration of chess into China and Southeast Asia has even less documentation than its migration west The first reference to Chinese chess called xiàngqí 象棋 appears in a book entitled Xuán guaì lù 玄怪錄 Record of the Mysterious and Strange dating to about 800 Alternatively some contend that chess arose from Chinese chess or one of its predecessors 15 although this has been contested 16 The game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes the earliest being in the 9thcentury By the year 1000 it had spread throughout both Muslim Iberia and Latin Europe 17 A Latin poem de scachis dated to the late 10th century has been preserved in Einsiedeln Abbey A famous 13thcentury manuscript covering shatranj backgammon and dice is known as the Libro de los juegos 12001700 Origins of the modern game Knights Templar playing chess Libro de los juegos 1283 Around 1200 the rules of shatranj started to be modified in southern Europe and around 1475 several major changes made the game essentially as it is known today 17 These modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in Italy and Spain 18 19 Pawns gained the option of advancing two squares on their first move while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities The queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece towards the end of the 10thcentury and by the 15thcentury had become the most powerful piece 20 consequently modern chess was referred to as Queens Chess or Mad Queen Chess 21 Castling derived from the kings leap usually in combination with a pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety was introduced These new rules quickly spread throughout western Europe A tactical puzzle from Lucenas 1497 book Writings about the theory of how to play chess began to appear in the 15thcentury The Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess by Spanish churchman Luis Ramirez de Lucena was published in Salamanca in 1497 19 Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco and Spanish bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of openings and started to analyze simple endgames 17001873 The Romantic Era in chess FrançoisAndré Danican Philidor 18thcentury French chess master In the 18th century the center of European chess life moved from the Southern European countries to France The two most important French masters were FrançoisAndré Danican Philidor a musician by profession who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy and later LouisCharles Mahé de La Bourdonnais who won a famous series of matches with the Irish master Alexander McDonnell in 1834 22 Centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in major European cities like Café de la Régence in Paris and Simpsons Divan in London 23 24 The rules concerning stalemate were finalized in the early 19thcentury Also in the 19thcentury the convention that White moves first was established formerly either White or Black could move first Finally the rules around castling were standardized variations in the castling rules had persisted in Italy until the late 19thcentury The resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as Western chess 25 or international chess 26 particularly in Asia where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent Since the 19thcentury the only rule changes have been technical in nature for example establishing the correct procedure for claiming a draw by repetition As the 19th century progressed chess organization developed quickly Many chess clubs chess books and chess journals appeared There were correspondence matches between cities for example the London Chess Club played against the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824 27 Chess problems became a regular part of 19thcentury newspapers Bernhard Horwitz Josef Kling and Samuel Loyd composed some of the most influential problems In 1843 von der Lasa published his and Bilguers Handbuch des Schachspiels Handbook of Chess the first comprehensive manual of chess theory Chess was occasionally criticized in the 19th century as a waste of time 28 29 The Immortal Game Anderssen vs Kieseritzky 1851 The first modern chess tournament was organized by Howard Staunton a leading English chess player and was held in London in 1851 It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen who was hailed as the leading chess master His brilliant energetic attacking style was typical for the time 30 31 Sparkling games like Anderssens Immortal Game and Evergreen Game or Morphys Opera Game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art 32 The romantic era was characterized by opening gambits sacrificing pawns or even pieces daring attacks and brazen sacrifices Many elaborate and beautiful but unsound move sequences called combinations were played by the masters of the time The game was played more for art than theory A profound belief that chess merit resided in the players genius rather than inherent in the position on the board pervaded chess practice Deeper insight into the nature of chess came with the American Paul Morphy an extraordinary chess prodigy Morphy won against all important competitors except Staunton who refused to play including Anderssen during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863 Morphys success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks 33 18731945 Birth of a sport Prague born Wilhelm Steinitz beginning in 1873 described how to avoid weaknesses in ones own position and how to create and exploit such weaknesses in the opponents position 34 The scientific approach and positional understanding of Steinitz revolutionized the game Steinitz was the first to break a position down into its components 35 Before Steinitz players brought their queen out early did not completely develop their other pieces and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king which either succeeded or failed The level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan 36 In addition to his theoretical achievements Steinitz founded an important tradition his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker who maintained this title for 27years the longest tenure of any world champion 37 Chess Players Cairo by Stanisław Chlebowski 18351884 After the end of the 19th century the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew Some sources state that in 1914 the title of chess Grandmaster was first formally conferred by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to Lasker Capablanca Alekhine Tarrasch and Marshall but this is a disputed claim note 4 The tradition of awarding such titles was continued by the World Chess Federation FIDE founded in 1924 in Paris In 1927 the Womens World Chess Championship was established the first to hold the title was CzechEnglish master Vera Menchik 38 It took a prodigy from Cuba José Raúl Capablanca World Champion 19211927 who loved simple positions and endgames to end the Germanspeaking dominance in chess he was undefeated in tournament play for eight years until 1924 His successor was RussianFrench Alexander Alekhine a strong attacking player who died as the world champion in 1946 He briefly lost the title to Dutch player Max Euwe in 1935 and regained it two years later 39 Between the world wars chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of socalled hypermodernists like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard Réti They advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns thus inviting opponents to occupy the center with pawns which become objects of attack 40 1945present PostWorld War II era After the death of Alekhine a new World Champion was sought FIDE which has controlled the title since then except for one interruption ran a tournament of elite players The winner of the 1948 tournament Russian Mikhail Botvinnik started an era of Soviet dominance in the chess world Until the end of the Soviet Union there was only one nonSoviet champion American Bobby Fischer champion 19721975 41 Botvinnik revolutionized opening theory Previously Black strove for equality to neutralize Whites firstmove advantage As Black Botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning 42 In the previous informal system of World Championships the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match FIDE set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches The worlds strongest players were seeded into Interzonal tournaments where they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal tournaments The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go on the Candidates stage which was initially a tournament and later a series of knockout matches The winner of the Candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title A champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later This system operated on a threeyear cycle Botvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years He won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954 In 1957 he lost to Vasily Smyslov but regained the title in a rematch in 1958 In 1960 he lost the title to the 23yearold Latvian prodigy Mikhail Tal an accomplished tactician and attacking player Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961 Following the 1961 event FIDE abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch and the next champion Armenian Tigran Petrosian a player renowned for his defensive and positional skills held the title for two cycles 19631969 His successor Boris Spassky from Russia champion 19691972 won games in both positional and sharp tactical style 43 The next championship the socalled Match of the Century saw the first nonSoviet challenger since World War II American Bobby Fischer who defeated his Candidates opponents by unheardof margins and clearly won the world championship match In 1975 however Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet Anatoly Karpov when FIDE did not meet his demands and Karpov obtained the title by default 44 Fischer modernized many aspects of chess especially by extensively preparing openings 45 Karpov defended his title twice against Viktor Korchnoi and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes 46 Karpovs reign finally ended in 1985 at the hands of Garry Kasparov another Soviet player from Baku Azerbaijan Kasparov and Karpov contested five world title matches between 1984 and 1990 Karpov never won his title back 47 In 1993 Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short broke with FIDE to organize their own match for the title and formed a competing Professional Chess Association PCA From then until 2006 there were two simultaneous World Champions and World Championships the PCA or Classical champion extending the Steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of many games and the other following FIDEs new format of many players competing in a tournament to determine the champion Kasparov lost his Classical title in 2000 to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia 48 The World Chess Championship 2006 in which Kramnik beat the FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov reunified the titles and made Kramnik the undisputed World Chess Champion 49 In September 2007 he lost the title to Viswanathan Anand of India who won the championship tournament in Mexico City Anand defended his title in the revenge match of 2008 50 2010 and 2012 In 2013 Magnus Carlsen beat Anand in the 2013 World Chess Championship 51 He defended his title the following year again against Anand Carlsen confirmed his title in 2016 against the Russian Sergey Karjakin 52 and in 2018 against the American Fabiano Caruana 53 in both occasions by a rapid tiebreaker match after equality in 12 games of classical time control and is the reigning world champion Place in culture

have been lost but others partially survive such as the Lewis chessmen Chess was often used as a basis of sermons on morality An example is Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium sive super ludo scacchorum Book of the customs of men and the duties of nobles or the Book of Chess written by an Italian Dominican monk Jacobus de Cessolis c 1300 This book was one of the most popular of the Middle Ages 56 The work was translated into many other languages the first printed edition was published at Utrecht in 1473 and was the basis for William Caxton s The Game and Playe of the Chesse 1474 one of the first books printed in English 57 Different chess pieces were used as metaphors for different classes of people and human duties were derived from the rules of the game or from visual properties of the chess pieces 58 The knyght ought to be made alle armed upon an hors in suche wyse that he haue an helme on his heed and a spere in his ryght hande and coueryd wyth his sheld a swerde

Carmina Burana from the 13thcentury which starts with the names of chess pieces Roch pedites regina 60 Modern During the Age of Enlightenment chess was viewed as a means of selfimprovement Benjamin Franklin in his article The Morals of Chess 1750 wrote The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement several very valuable qualities of the mind useful in the course of human life are to be acquired and strengthened by it so as to become habits ready on all occasions for life is a kind of Chess in which we have often points to gain and competitors or adversaries to contend with and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events that are in some degree the effect of prudence or the want of it By playing at Chess then we may learn I Foresight which looks a little into futurity and considers the consequences that may attend an action II Circumspection which surveys the whole Chessboard or scene of action the relation of the several Pieces and their situations III Caution not to make our moves too hastily 61 With these or similar views chess is taught to children in schools around the world today Many schools host chess clubs and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children Tournaments are held regularly in many countries hosted by organizations such as the United States Chess Federation and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation

Game at Chess to Through the LookingGlass by Lewis Carroll to Vladimir Nabokovs The Defense to The Royal Game by Stefan Zweig Chess is featured in films like Ingmar Bergmans The Seventh Seal and Satyajit Rays The Chess Players Chess is also present in contemporary popular culture For example the characters in Star Trek play a futuristic version of the game called TriDimensional Chess Wizards Chess is featured in JK Rowlings Harry Potter plays The hero of Searching for Bobby Fischer struggles against adopting the aggressive and misanthropic views of a world chess champion 63 Chess is used as the core theme in the musical Chess by Tim Rice Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson The thriller film Knight Moves is about a chess grandmaster who is accused of being a serial killer Pawn Sacrifice starring Tobey Maguire as Bobby Fischer and Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky depicts the drama surrounding the 1972 World Chess Championship in Iceland during the Cold War 64 Prohibition in Islam In 1979 in Islamic Republic of Iran Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious fatwa ruling against chess on the grounds that it excessively fatigues the brain 65 and constitutes gambling The same Ayatollah lifted the ban in 1988 however and said it was permissible as long as it was not a means of gambling Iran now has an active confederation for playing chess and sends players to international events 66 Grand Ayatollah Ali alSistani of Iraq issued multiple fatwas against chess and backgammon ruling that playing both is absolutely forbidden even without placing a bet 67 In 2016 in Saudi Arabia Grand Mufti AbdulAziz ibn Abdullah Al ashSheikh issued a religious fatwa ruling that chess is forbidden in Islam because it constitutes gambling stating chess is a waste of time and an opportunity to squander money It causes enmity and hatred between people This fatwa is not legally binding however and chess remains a popular game in Muslim countries 68 Notation for recording moves Main article Chess notation Square names in algebraic chess notation Chess games and positions are recorded using a system of notation most commonly algebraic chess notation 69 Abbreviated algebraic or short algebraic notation generally records moves in the format abbreviation of the piece moved file where it moved rank where it moved The pieces are identified by their initials In English these are K king Q queen R rook B bishop and N knight N is used to avoid confusion with king For example Qg5 means queen moves to the gfile 5th rank that is to the square g5 Chess literature published in other languages may use different initials for pieces or figurine algebraic notation FAN may be used to avoid language issues To resolve ambiguities an additional letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved eg Ngf3 means knight from the gfile moves to the square f3 R1e2 means rook on the first rank moves to e2 The letter P for pawn is not used so e4 means pawn moves to the square e4 If the piece makes a capture x is inserted before the destination square Thus Bxf3 means bishop captures on f3 When a pawn makes a capture the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial and ranks may be omitted if unambiguous For example exd5 pawn on the efile captures the piece on d5 or exd pawn on the efile captures a piece somewhere on the dfile Particularly in Germany some publications use rather than x to indicate capture but this is now rare Some publications omit the capture symbol altogether so exd5 would be rendered simply as ed If a pawn moves to its last rank achieving promotion the piece chosen is indicated after the move for example e1Q or e1Q Castling is indicated by the special notations 00 for kingside castling and 000 for queenside castling An en passant capture is sometimes marked with the notation ep A move that places the opponents king in check usually has the notation added the notation for a double check is considered obsolete Checkmate can be indicated by At the end of the game 10 means White won 01 means Black won and indicates a draw 70 Chess moves can be annotated with punctuation marks and other symbols For example indicates a good move an excellent move a mistake a blunder an interesting move that may not be best or a dubious move not easily refuted 71 Scholars mate For example one variation of a simple trap known as the Scholars mate see animated diagram can be recorded 1 e4 e5 2 Qh5 Nc6 3 Bc4 Nf6 4 Qxf7 The textbased Portable Game Notation PGN which is understood by chess software is based on short form English language algebraic notation Until about 1980 the majority of English language chess publications used a form of descriptive notation In descriptive notation files are named according to the piece which occupies the back rank at the start of the game and each square has two different names depending on whether it is from Whites or Blacks point of view For example the square known as e3 in algebraic notation is K3 Kings 3rd from Whites point of view and K6 Kings 6th from Blacks point of view When recording captures the captured piece is named rather than the square on which it is captured except to resolve ambiguities Thus Scholars mate is rendered in descriptive notation 1 PK4 PK4 2 QR5 NQB3 3 BB4 NB3 4 QxBP mate A few players still prefer descriptive notation but it is no longer recognized by FIDE Another system is ICCF numeric notation recognized by the International Correspondence Chess Federation though its use is in decline Squares are identified by numeric coordinates for example a1 is 11 and h8 is 88 Moves are described by the from and to squares eg the opening move 1e4 is rendered as 15254 Captures are not indicated Castling is described by the kings move only eg 5171 for White castling kingside 5838 for Black castling queenside Stages A game of chess can generally be loosely subdivided into three phases or stages of play the opening followed by the middlegame then last the endgame Opening Main article Chess opening A chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game the opening moves Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been given names such as the Ruy Lopez or Sicilian Defense They are catalogued in reference works such as the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings There are dozens of different openings varying widely in character from quiet positional play for example the Réti Opening to very aggressive the Latvian Gambit In some opening lines the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves 72 Professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers as opening theory continues to evolve The fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar 73 development This is the technique of placing the pieces particularly bishops and knights on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game control of the center Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent king safety It is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities A correctly timed castling can often enhance this pawn structure Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated doubled or backward pawns and pawn islands and to force such weaknesses in the opponents position Most players and theoreticians consider that White by virtue of the first move begins the game with a small advantage This initially gives White the initiative 74 Black usually strives to neutralize Whites advantage and achieve equality or to develop dynamic counterplay in an unbalanced position Middlegame Main article Chess middlegame The middlegame is the part of the game which starts after the opening There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed Similarly there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame see start of the endgame Because the opening theory has ended players have to form plans based on the features of the position and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position 75 The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponents king Some typical patterns have their own names for example the Bodens Mate or the LaskerBauer combination 76 Specific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which result in a specific type of pawn structure An example is the minority attack which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames 77 Another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame ie simplify Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose for example if one side keeps a lightsquared bishop and the opponent has a darksquared one the transformation into a bishops and pawns ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be a draw even with an advantage of a pawn or sometimes even with a twopawn advantage 78 Endgame Main article Chess endgame Example of zugzwang a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h The side having to move is disadvantaged The endgame also end game or ending is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and the endgame 79 Pawns become more important Endgames often revolve around endeavors to promote a pawn by advancing it to the furthest rank The king which requires safeguarding from attack during the middlegame emerges as a strong piece in the endgame It is often brought to the center where it can protect its own pawns attack enemy pawns and hinder moves of the opponents king Zugzwang a situation in which the player who is to move is forced to incur a disadvantage is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game In the example diagram either side having the move is in zugzwang Black to move must play 1Kb7 allowing White to promote the pawn after 2Kd7 White to move must permit a draw either by 1Kc6 stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move Endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces remaining on the board Basic checkmates are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king with the pieces working together with their king For example king and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns Other more complicated endings are classified according to pieces on the board other than kings such as rook and pawn versus rook endgames Strategy and tactics Chess strategy consists of setting and achieving longterm positioning advantages during the game for example where to place different pieces while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver These two aspects of the gameplay cannot be completely separated because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play A game of chess is normally divided into three phases the opening typically the first 10 moves when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle the middlegame and last the endgame when most of the pieces are gone kings typically take a more active part in the struggle and pawn promotion is often decisive Fundamentals of tactics Main article Chess tactics Botvinnik vs Yudovich 1933 80 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h After sacrificing a piece to expose Blacks king Botvinnik played 23Bh5 and Yudovich resigned as mate is inevitable 23Bh5 and now 23Kxh5 24Ng3 Kh4 25Qe4 Rf4 26Qxf4 23Kf5 24g4 23Kh7 24Nf6 double check Kh8 25Qh7 In chess tactics in general concentrate on shortterm actions so shortterm that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or a computer The possible depth of calculation depends on the players ability In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical while in positions with a limited number of forced variations strong players can calculate long sequences of moves Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers for example pins forks skewers batteries discovered attacks especially discovered checks zwischenzugs deflections decoys sacrifices underminings overloadings and interferences 81 Simple onemove or twomove tactical actions threats exchanges of material and double attacks can be combined into more complicated sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players 82 A forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a combination 82 Brilliant combinations such as those in the Immortal Game are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers A common type of chess exercise aimed at developing players skills is a position where a decisive combination is available and the challenge is to find it 83 Fundamentals of strategy Main article Chess strategy Chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and longterm plans for the future play During the evaluation players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board control of the center and centralization the pawn structure king safety and the control of key squares or groups of squares for example diagonals open files and dark or light squares The most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides 84 The point values used for this purpose are based on experience usually pawns are considered worth one point knights and bishops about three points each rooks about five points the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange and queens about nine points The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined since its checkmate loses the game But in practical terms in the endgame the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook 85 These basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece eg advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares coordination between pieces eg a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight or the type of position eg knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions 86 Example of underlying pawn structure a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h After 12Re8 in TarraschEuwe 87 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h and its pawn Rauzer formation Another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure sometimes known as the pawn skeleton the configuration of pawns on the chessboard 88 Since pawns are the least mobile of the pieces the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position Weaknesses in the pawn structure such as isolated doubled or backward pawns and holes once created are often permanent Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset for example by the possibility of developing an attack 89 Competitive play Organization of competitions Contemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues tournaments and congresses Chesss international governing body is FIDE Fédération Internationale des Échecs Most countries have a national chess organization as well such as the US Chess Federation and English Chess Federation which in turn is a member of FIDE FIDE is a member of the International Olympic Committee 90 but the game of chess has never been part of the Olympic Games chess does have its own Olympiad held every two years as a team event Former world champion Viswanathan Anand left playing against his predecessor Vladimir Kramnik The current World Chess Champion is Magnus Carlsen of Norway 91 The reigning Womens World Champion is Hou Yifan from China 92 The worlds highest rated female player Judit Polgár has never participated in the Womens World Chess Championship instead preferring to compete with the leading men and maintaining a ranking among the top male players 93 Other competitions for individuals include the World Junior Chess Championship the European Individual Chess Championship and the National Chess Championships Invitationonly tournaments regularly attract the worlds strongest players Examples include Spains Linares event Monte Carlos Melody Amber tournament the Dortmund Sparkassen meeting Sofias Mtel Masters and Wijk aan Zees Tata Steel tournament Regular team chess events include the Chess Olympiad and the European Team Chess Championship The World Chess Solving Championship and World Correspondence Chess Championships include both team and individual events Besides these prestigious competitions there are thousands of other chess tournaments matches and festivals held around the world every year catering to players of all levels Chess is promoted as a mind sport by the Mind Sports Organisation alongside other mentalskill games such as contract bridge Go and Scrabble Titles and rankings Main article Chess titles GM Garry Kasparov former World Chess Champion is considered by many to be one of the greatest chess players of all time The best players can be awarded specific lifetime titles by the world chess organization FIDE 94 Grandmaster shortened as GM sometimes International Grandmaster or IGM is used is awarded to worldclass chess masters Apart from World Champion Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain Before FIDE will confer the title on a player the player must have an Elo chess rating see below of at least 2500 at one time and three favorable results called norms in tournaments involving other grandmasters including some from countries other than the applicants There are other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title such as winning the World Junior Championship International Master shortened as IM The conditions are similar to GM but less demanding The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400 FIDE Master shortened as FM The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE rating of 2300 or more Candidate Master shortened as CM Similar to FM but with a FIDE rating of at least 2200 All the titles are open to men and women Separate womenonly titles such as Woman Grandmaster WGM are available Beginning with Nona Gaprindashvili in 1978 a number of women have earned the GM title and most of the top ten women in 2006 hold the unrestricted GM title note 5 As of 2018 update there are 1725 active grandmasters and 3903 international masters in the world The top three countries with the largest numbers of grandmasters are Russia the United States and Germany with 251 98 and 96 respectively 95 FIDE also awards titles for arbiters and trainers 96 97 International titles are awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players by the International Correspondence Chess Federation National chess organizations may also award titles usually to the advanced players still under the level needed for international titles an example is the chess expert title used in the United States In order to rank players FIDE ICCF and national chess organizations use the Elo rating system developed by Arpad Elo Elo is a statistical system based on the assumption that the chess performance of each player in his or her games is a random variable Arpad Elo thought of a players true skill as the average of that players performance random variable and showed how to estimate the average from results of players games The US Chess Federation implemented Elos suggestions in 1960 and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fairer and more accurate than older systems it was adopted by FIDE in 1970 note 6 A beginner or casual player typically has an Elo rating of less than 1000 an ordinary club player has a rating of about 1500 a strong club player about 2000 a grandmaster usually has a rating of over 2500 and an elite player has a rating of over 2700 The highest FIDE rating of all time 2881 was achieved by Magnus Carlsen on the March 2014 FIDE rating list 98 Composition Main article Chess problem Chess composition is the art of creating chess problems also called chess compositions The creator is known as a chess composer 99 There are many types of chess problems the two most important are Directmates White to move first and checkmate Black within a specified number of moves against any defense These are often referred to as mate in n for example mate in three a threemover two and threemove problems are the most common These usually involve positions that would be highly unlikely to occur in an actual game and are intended to illustrate a particular theme usually requiring a surprising or counterintuitive key move 100 Studies orthodox problems where the stipulation is that White to play must win or draw Almost all studies are endgame positions 101 Chess composition is a distinct branch of chess sport and tournaments exist for both the composition and solving of chess problems 102 Example Main article Réti endgame study Richard Réti Ostrauer Morgenzeitung 1921 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h White to move and draw This is one of the most famous chess studies it was published by Richard Réti 4 December 1921 It seems impossible to catch the advanced black pawn while the black king can easily stop the white pawn The solution is a diagonal advance which brings the king to both pawns simultaneously 1 Kg7 h4 2 Kf6 Kb6 Or 2h3 3Ke7 and the white king can support its pawn 3 Ke5 Now the white king comes just in time to support his pawn or catch the black one 3 h3 If 3Kxc6 4Kf4 and White will capture the pawn 4 Kd6 Both sides will queen resulting in a draw 103 Publications Main articles Chess libraries List of chess books and List of chess periodicals Chess has a very extensive literature In 1913 the chess historian HJR Murray estimated the total number of books magazines and chess columns in newspapers to be about 5000 104 105 BH Wood estimated the number as of 1949 to be about 20000 105 David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write that Since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications No one knows how many have been printed 105 There are two significant public chess libraries the John G White Chess and Checkers Collection at Cleveland Public Library with over 32000 chess books and over 6000 bound volumes of chess periodicals 106 and the Chess Draughts collection at the National Library of the Netherlands with about 30000 books 107 GM Lothar Schmid owned the worlds largest private collection of chess books and memorabilia 108 David DeLucias chess library contains 7000 to 8000 chess books a similar number of autographs letters score sheets manuscripts and about 1000 items of ephemera 109 Dirk Jan ten Geuzendam opines that DeLucias collection is arguably the finest chess collection in the world 110 Mathematics and computers See also Computer chess Mathematical chess problem Humancomputer chess matches Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov Chess engine and Solving chess The game structure and nature of chess are related to several branches of mathematics Many combinatorical and topological problems connected to chess have been known for hundreds of years Combinatorics of chess and chess puzzles Mathematicians Euler Legendre de Moivre and Vandermonde studied the knights tour The number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be about 10 43 and has been proved to be fewer than 10 47 111 112 with a gametree complexity of approximately 10 123 The gametree complexity of chess was first calculated by Claude Shannon as 10 120 a number known as the Shannon number 113 An average position typically has thirty to forty possible moves but there may be as few as zero in the case of checkmate or stalemate or in a constructed position as many as 218 114 Chess has inspired many combinatorial puzzles such as the knights tour and the eight queens puzzle Computer chess The idea of creating a chessplaying machine dates to the 18thcentury around 1769 the chessplaying automaton called The Turk became famous before being exposed as a hoax 115 Serious trials based on automata such as El Ajedrecista were too complex and limited to be useful Since the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s chess enthusiasts computer engineers and computer scientists have built with increasing degrees of seriousness and success chessplaying machines and computer programs 116 The groundbreaking paper on computer chess Programming a Computer for Playing Chess was published in 1950 by Shannon note 7 He wrote The chess machine is an ideal one to start with since 1 the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations the moves and in the ultimate goal checkmate 2 it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution 3 chess is generally considered to require thinking for skillful play a solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of thinking 4 the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature ofmodern computers 118 1990s chessplaying computer The Association for Computing Machinery ACM held the first major chess tournament for computers the North American Computer Chess Championship in September 1970 CHESS 30 a chess program from Northwestern University won the championship Nowadays chess programs compete in the World Computer Chess Championship held annually since 1974 At first considered only a curiosity the best chess playing programs have become extremely strong In 1997 a computer won a chess match using classical time controls against a reigning World Champion for the first time IBMs Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov 32 it scored two wins one loss and three draws 119 120 However the match was controversial 121 and computers would only win such a match again in 2006 In 2009 a mobile phone won a category 6 tournament with a performance rating 2898 chess engine Hiarcs 13 running on the mobile phone HTC Touch HD won the Copa Mercosur tournament with nine wins and one draw 122 The best chess programs are now able to consistently beat the strongest human players to the extent that humancomputer matches no longer attract interest from chess players or media With huge databases of past games and high analytical ability computers can help players to learn chess and prepare for matches Internet Chess Servers allow people to find and play opponents worldwide The presence of computers and modern communication tools have raised concerns regarding cheating during games most notably the bathroom controversy during the 2006 World Championship 123 Relation to game theory In 1913 Ernst Zermelo used chess as a basis for his theory of game strategies which is considered as one of the predecessors of game theory 124 Zermelos theorem states that it is possible to solve chess ie to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game either White can force a win or Black can force a win or both sides can force at least a draw 125 According to Claude Shannon however there are 10 43 legal positions in chess so it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology 126 The 11category game theoretical taxonomy of chess includes two player nochance combinatorial Markov state present state is all a player needs to move although past state led up to that point knowledge of the sequence of past moves is not required to make the next move except to take into account of en passant and castling which do depend on the past moves zero sum symmetric perfect information noncooperative discrete extensive form tree decisions not payoff matrices and sequential 127 Computational complexity Generalized chess played on n n board without the fiftymove rule is EXPTIMEcomplete 128 Combinatorial game theory Some applications of combinatorial game theory to chess endgames were found by Elkies 1996 129 Psychology A childrens chess tournament in the United States There is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology note 8 note 9 131 132 133 134 Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal rather than visuospatial ability lies at the core of expertise 135 136 In his doctoral thesis Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position 137 According to de Groot this perception made possible by years of practice and study is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly The ability to memorize does not alone account for chessplaying skill since masters and novices when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces had equivalent recall about six positions in each case Rather it is the ability to recognize patterns which are then memorized which distinguished the skilled players from the novices When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game the masters had almost total positional recall 138 More recent research has focused on chess as mental training the respective roles of knowledge and lookahead search brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices blindfold chess the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill gender differences and computational models of chess expertise The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much recent research Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess 139 Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important For example Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring Compared to general population chess players are more likely to be nonrighthanded though they found no correlation between handedness and skill 140 Chess and intelligence A relationship between chess skill and intelligence has long been discussed in the literature and popular culture Academic studies of the relationship date back at least to 1927 141 142 Academic opinion has long been split on how strong the relationship is with some studies finding no relationship and others finding a relatively strong one 142 143 A 2016 metaanalysis and review based on 19 studies and a total sample size of 1779 found that various aspects of general intelligence correlate with chess skill with average correlations ranging from 013 visuospatial ability to 035 numerical ability 142 The review did not find strong evidence of publication bias biasing these estimates Moderator analyses indicated that the relationship was stronger in unranked players r 032 vs ranked players r 014 as well as stronger in children r 032 than adults r 011 Variants Main articles Chess variant and List of chess variants Glińskis hexagonal chess launched in 1949 became popular in Eastern Europe reaching half a million fans Three cell colors and three bishops per side are the norm for hexagonal variants There are more than two thousand published chess variants 144 most of them of relatively recent origin 145 including Direct predecessors of chess such as chaturanga and shatranj Traditional national or regional

nonstandard pieces eg Grand Chess or different board geometries eg hexagonal chess One rules variant that has gained significantly in popularity is Chess960 named Fischerandom by its inventor In Chess960 the starting position is selected randomly from 960 unique possibilities including the classic chess initial position without change while the other 959 render the use of prepared opening
