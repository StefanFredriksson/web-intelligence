chi χ 2 is a repository of electronic preprints known as eprints approved for posting after moderation but not full peer review It consists of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics physics astronomy electrical engineering computer science quantitative biology statistics mathematical finance and economics which can be accessed online In many fields of mathematics and physics almost all scientific papers are selfarchived on the arXiv repository Begun on August 14 1991 arXivorg passed the halfmillionarticle milestone on October 3 2008 3 4 and had hit a million by the end of 2014 5 6 By October 2016 the submission rate had grown to more than 10000 per month 6 7 Contents 1 History 2 Moderation process and endorsement 3 Submission formats 4 Access 5 Copyright status of files 6

was made possible by the compact TeX file format which allowed scientific papers to be easily transmitted over the Internet and rendered clientside 9 Around 1990 Joanne Cohn began emailing physics preprints to colleagues as TeX files but the number of papers being sent soon filled mailboxes to capacity Paul Ginsparg recognized the need for central storage and in August 1991 he created a central repository mailbox stored at the Los Alamos National Laboratory LANL which could be accessed from any computer Additional modes of access were soon added FTP in 1991 Gopher in 1992 and the World Wide Web in 1993 6 10 The term eprint was quickly adopted to describe the articles It began as a physics archive called the LANL preprint archive but soon expanded to include astronomy mathematics computer science quantitative biology and most recently statistics Its original domain name was xxxlanlgov Due to LANLs lack of interest in the rapidly expanding technology in 2001 Ginsparg changed institutions to Cornell University and changed the name of the repository to arXivorg 11 It is now hosted principally by Cornell with eight mirrors around the world 12 Its existence was one of the precipitating factors that led to the current movement in scientific publishing known as open access Mathematicians and scientists regularly upload their papers to arXivorg for worldwide access 13 and sometimes for reviews before they are published in peerreviewed journals Ginsparg was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2002 for his establishment of arXiv The annual budget for arXiv was approximately 826000 for 2013 to 2017 funded jointly by Cornell University Library the Simons Foundation in both gift and challenge grant forms and annual fee income from member institutions 14 This model arose in 2010 when Cornell sought to broaden the financial funding of the project by asking institutions to make annual voluntary contributions based on the amount of download usage by each institution Each member institution pledges a fiveyear funding commitment to support arXiv Based on institutional usage ranking the annual fees are set in four tiers from 1000 to 4400 Cornells goal is to raise at least 504000 per year through membership fees generated by approximately 220 institutions 15 In September 2011 Cornell University Library took overall administrative and financial responsibility for arXivs operation and development Ginsparg was quoted in the Chronicle of Higher Education as saying it was supposed to be a threehour tour not a life sentence 16 However Ginsparg remains on the arXiv Scientific Advisory Board and on the arXiv Physics Advisory Committee Moderation process and endorsement edit Although arXiv is not peer reviewed a collection of moderators for each area review the submissions they may recategorize any that are deemed offtopic 17 or reject submissions that are not scientific papers or sometimes for undisclosed reasons 18 The lists of moderators for many sections of arXiv are publicly available 19 but moderators for most of the physics sections remain unlisted Additionally an endorsement system was introduced in 2004 as part of an effort to ensure content is relevant and of interest to current research in the specified disciplines 20 Under the system for categories that use it an author must be endorsed by an established arXiv author before being allowed to submit papers to those categories Endorsers are not asked to review the paper for errors but to check whether the paper is appropriate for the intended subject area 17 New authors from recognized academic institutions generally receive automatic endorsement which in practice means that they do not need to deal with the endorsement system at all However the endorsement system has attracted criticism for allegedly restricting scientific inquiry 21 A majority of the eprints are also submitted to journals for publication but some work including some very influential papers remain purely as eprints and are never published in a peerreviewed journal A wellknown example of the latter is an outline of a proof of Thurstons geometrization conjecture including the Poincaré conjecture as a particular case uploaded by Grigori Perelman in November 2002 22 Perelman appears content to forgo the traditional peerreviewed journal process stating If anybody is interested in my way of solving the problem its all there on the arXiv let them go and read about it 23 Despite this nontraditional method of publication other mathematicians recognized this work by offering the Fields Medal and Clay Mathematics Millennium Prizes to Perelman both of which he refused 24 Submission formats edit Papers can be submitted in any of several formats including LaTeX and PDF printed from a word processor other than TeX or LaTeX The submission is rejected by the arXiv software if generating the final PDF file fails if any image file is too large or if the total size of the submission is too large arXiv now allows one to store and modify an incomplete submission and only finalize the submission when ready The time stamp on the article is set when the submission is finalized Access edit The standard access route is through the arXivorg website or one of several mirrors Several other interfaces and access routes have also been created by other unassociated organisations These include the University of California Davis s front a web portal that offers additional search functions and a more selfexplanatory interface for arXivorg and is referred to by some mathematicians as the Front 25 A similar function used to be offered by eprintweborg launched in September 2006 by the Institute of Physics and was switched off on June 30 2014 Carnegie Mellon provides Table arXiv 26 a search engine for tables extracted from arXiv publications Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic can also be used to search for items in arXiv 27 Finally researchers can select subfields and receive daily emailings or RSS feeds of all submissions in them Copyright status of files edit Files on arXiv can have a number of different copyright statuses 28 Some are public domain in which case they will have a statement saying so Some are available under either the Creative Commons 30 AttributionShareAlike license or the Creative Commons 30 AttributionNoncommercialShareAlike license Some are copyright to the publisher but the author has the right to distribute them and has given arXiv a nonexclusive irrevocable license to distribute them Most are copyright to the author and arXiv has only a nonexclusive irrevocable license to distribute them Controversy edit While arXiv does contain some dubious eprints such as those claiming to refute famous theorems or proving famous conjectures such as Fermats Last Theorem using only highschool mathematics a 2002 article which appeared in Notices of the American Mathematical Society described those as surprisingly rare 29 arXiv generally reclassifies these works eg in General mathematics rather than deleting them 30 however some authors have voiced concern over the lack of transparency in the arXiv screening process 31 See also edit bioRxiv require preprints not yet accepted by any journal Hyper Articles en Ligne List of academic databases and search engines List of
