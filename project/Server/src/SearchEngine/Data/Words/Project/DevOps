Ingo Weber and Liming Zhu three computer science researchers from the CSIRO and the Software Engineering Institute suggested defining DevOps as a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production while ensuring high quality 6 The term DevOps however has been used in multiple contexts 7 unreliable source History

to be a crossfunctional mode of working those that practice the methodology use different sets of toolsreferred to as toolchains rather than a single one 17 These toolchains are expected to fit into one or more of the following categories reflective of key aspects of the development and delivery process 18 unreliable source 19 unreliable source Coding code development and review source code management tools code merging Building continuous integration tools build status Testing continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks Packaging artifact repository application predeployment staging Releasing change management release approvals release automation Configuring infrastructure configuration and management infrastructure as code tools Monitoring applications performance monitoring enduser experience Some categories are more essential in a DevOps toolchain than others especially continuous integration eg Jenkins Gitlab Bitbucket pipelines and infrastructure as code eg Terraform Ansible Puppet 20 unreliable source 21 unreliable source Forsgren et al found that IT performance is strongly correlated with DevOps practices like source code management and continuous delivery 13 Relationship to other approaches edit Agile edit Main article Agile software development Agile and DevOps serve complementary roles several standard DevOps practices such as automated build and test continuous integration and continuous delivery originated in the Agile world which dates informally to the 1990s and formally to 2001 22 Agile can be viewed as addressing communication gaps between customers and developers while DevOps addresses gaps between developers and IT operations infrastructure 23 Also DevOps has focus on the deployment of developed software whether it is developed via Agile or other methodologies 22 ArchOps edit ArchOps presents an extension for DevOps practice starting from software architecture artifacts instead of source code for operation deployment 24 ArchOps states that architectural models are firstclass entities in software development deployment and operations TestOps edit TestOps is to hardware development what DevOps is to software development The idea is a toolchain that links design and test op eration s together In the case of hardware design means EDA tools and the CAD department and test means electronic measurement equipment like oscilloscopes and so on 25 Continuous delivery edit Main article Continuous delivery Continuous delivery and DevOps have common goals and are often used in conjunction but there are subtle differences 26 27 While continuous delivery is focused on automating the processes in software delivery DevOps also focuses on the organizational change to support great collaboration between the many functions involved 26 DevOps and continuous delivery share a common background in agile methods and lean thinking small and frequent changes with focused value to the end customer 28 unreliable source Lean management and continuous delivery are fundamental to delivering value faster in a sustainable way 14 Continuous delivery focuses on making sure the software is always in a releasable state throughout its lifecycle 13 This makes it cheaper and less risky to deliver the software 13 Improved collaboration and communication both between and within organizational teams can help achieve faster time to market with reduced risks 29 30 DataOps edit Some of this sections listed sources may not be reliable Please help this article by looking for

features continuously into largescale highavailability systems while maintaining highquality enduser experience 33 While SRE predates the development of DevOps they are generally viewed as being related to each other 34 unreliable source Systems administration edit This section needs expansion You can help by adding to it June 2018 DevOps is often viewed as an approach to applying systems administration work to cloud technology 35 WinOps edit Main article WinOps WinOps is the term used for DevOps practices for a Microsoftcentric view citation needed Goals edit Some of this sections

template message IT performance can be measured in terms of throughput and stability 13 Throughput can be measured by deployment frequency and lead time for changes stability can be measured by mean time to recover The State of DevOps Reports found that investing in practices that increase these throughput and stability measures increase IT performance 13 14 The goals of DevOps span the entire delivery pipeline They include citation needed Improved deployment frequency Faster time to market Lower failure rate of new releases Shortened lead time between fixes Faster mean time to recovery in the event of a new release crashing or otherwise disabling the current system Simple processes become increasingly programmable and dynamic using a DevOps approach 36 unreliable source DevOps aims to maximize the predictability efficiency security and maintainability of operational processes citation needed Very often automation supports this objective DevOps integration targets product delivery continuous testing quality testing feature development and maintenance releases in order to improve reliability and security and provide faster development and deployment cycles citation needed Many of the ideas and people involved in DevOps came from the enterprise systems management and agile software development movements 37 unreliable source Practices that correlate with deployment frequency are 13 Continuous delivery Using version control for all production artifacts Practices that correlate with a lead time for change are 13 Using version control for all production artifacts Automated testing Practices that correlate with a mean time to recovery for change are 13 Using version control for all production artifacts Monitoring system and application health Companies that practice DevOps failed verification have reported significant benefits including significantly shorter time to market improved customer satisfaction better product quality more reliable releases improved productivity and efficiency and the increased ability to build the right product by fast experimentation 29 The 2014 State of DevOps Report found that IT performance strongly correlates with wellknown DevOps practices such as the use of versioncontrol and continuous delivery 13 Criticism edit There is a lack of evidence in academic literature on the effectiveness of DevOps e Cultural change edit DevOps initiatives can create cultural changes in companies 38 by transforming the way operations developers and testers collaborate during the development and delivery processes 2 Getting these groups to work cohesively is a critical challenge in enterprise DevOps adoption 39 40 DevOps is as much about culture as it is about the toolchain 41 DevOps as a job title edit While DevOps describes an approach to work rather than a distinct role like system administrator job advertisements are increasingly using terms like DevOps Engineer 42 unreliable source 43 While DevOps reflects complex topics the DevOps community uses analogies to communicate important concepts relevant discuss much like The Cathedral and the Bazaar from the opensource community 44 Cattle not Pets the paradigm of disposable server infrastructure 45 10 deployments per day the story of Flickr adopting DevOps Building a DevOps culture edit Organizational culture is a strong predictor of IT and organizational performance Cultural practices such as information flow collaboration shared responsibilities learning from failures and new ideas are central to DevOps 13 Teambuilding and other employee engagement activities are often used to create an environment that fosters this communication and cultural change within an organization 46 Teambuilding activities can include board games trust activities and employee engagement seminars 47 unreliable source The 2015 State of DevOps Report discovered that the top seven measures with the strongest correlation to organizational culture are1 Organizational

source Architecturally significant requirements edit To practice DevOps effectively software applications have to meet a set of architecturally significant requirements ASRs such as deployability modifiability testability and monitorability 54 These ASRs require a high priority and cannot be traded off lightly Microservices edit Although in principle it is possible to practice DevOps with any architectural style the microservices architectural style is becoming the standard for building continuously deployed systems 30 Small size service allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring 55 hence reducing the need for a big upfront design citation needed allows for releasing the software early citation needed and continuously DevOps automation edit DevOps automation can be achieved by repackaging platforms systems and applications into reusable building blocks through the use of technologies such as virtual machines and containerization 56 unreliable source 57 Implementation of DevOps automation in the ITorganization is heavily dependent on tools 13 58 unreliable source which are required citation needed to cover different areas of the

2016 citation needed And among larger enterprise organizations DevOps adoption is even higher 81 percent 60 unreliable source Adoption of DevOps is being driven by many factors including citation needed Use of agile and other development processes and methods Demand for an increased rate of production releases from application and business unit stakeholders Wide availability of virtualized 61 unreliable source and cloud infrastructure from internal and external providers Increased usage of data center automation 62 unreliable source and configuration management tools Increased focus on test automation 63 unreliable source and continuous integration methods A critical mass of publicly available best practices See also edit Twelvefactor app Infrastructure as Code Notes edit Dyck et al 2015 To our knowledge there is no uniform definition for the terms release engineering and DevOps As a consequence many people use their own definitions or rely on others which results in confusion about those terms 3 Jabbari et al 2016 The research results of this study showed the need for a definition as individual studies do not consistently define DevOps 4 Erich et al 2017 We noticed that there are various gaps in the study of DevOps There is no consensus of what concepts DevOps covers nor how DevOps is defined 5 Erich et al 2017 We discovered that there exists little agreement about the characteristics of DevOps in the academic literature 5 Erich et al 2017 We noticed that there are various gaps in the study of DevOps There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of DevOps 5
