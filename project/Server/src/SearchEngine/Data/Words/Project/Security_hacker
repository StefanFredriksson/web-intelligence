Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons such as profit protest information gathering 1 challenge recreation 2 or to evaluate system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against potential hackers The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the computer underground 3 Longstanding controversy surrounds the meaning of the term hacker In this controversy computer programmers reclaim the term hacker arguing that it refers simply to someone with an advanced understanding of computers and computer networks 4 and that cracker is the more appropriate term for those who break into computers whether computer criminals black hats or computer security experts white hats 5 6 A 2014 article noted that the blackhat meaning still prevails

Further reading 12 External links History Further information Timeline of computer security hacker history Bruce Sterling author of The Hacker Crackdown In computer security a hacker is someone who focuses on security mechanisms of computer and network systems While including those who endeavor to strengthen such mechanisms it is more often used by the mass media and popular culture to refer to those who seek access despite these security measures That is the media portrays the hacker as a villain Nevertheless parts of the subculture see their aim in correcting security problems and use the word in a positive sense White hat is the name given to ethical computer hackers who utilize hacking in a helpful way White hats are becoming a necessary part of the information security field 8 They operate under a code which acknowledges that breaking into other peoples computers is bad but that discovering and exploiting security mechanisms and breaking into computers is still an interesting activity that can be done ethically and legally Accordingly the term bears strong connotations that are favorable or pejorative depending on the context The subculture around such hackers is termed network hacker subculture hacker scene or computer underground It initially developed in the context of phreaking during the 1960s and the microcomputer BBS scene of the 1980s It is implicated with 2600 The Hacker Quarterly and the alt2600 newsgroup In 1980 an article in the August issue of Psychology Today with commentary by Philip Zimbardo used the term hacker in its title The Hacker Papers It was an excerpt from a Stanford Bulletin Board discussion on the addictive nature of computer use In the 1982 film Tron Kevin Flynn Jeff Bridges describes his intentions to break into ENCOMs computer system saying Ive been doing a little hacking here CLU is the software he uses for this By 1983 hacking in the sense of breaking computer security had already been in use as computer jargon 9 but there was no public awareness about such activities 10 However the release of the film WarGames that year featuring a computer intrusion into NORAD raised the public belief that computer security hackers especially teenagers could be a threat to national security This concern became real when in the same year a gang of teenage hackers in Milwaukee Wisconsin known as The 414s broke into computer systems throughout the United States and Canada including those of Los Alamos National Laboratory SloanKettering Cancer Center and Security Pacific Bank 11 The case quickly grew media attention 11 12 and 17yearold Neal Patrick emerged as the spokesman for the gang including a cover story in Newsweek entitled Beware Hackers at play with Patricks photograph on the cover 13 The Newsweek article appears to be the first use of the word hacker by the mainstream media in the pejorative sense Pressured by media coverage congressman Dan Glickman called for an investigation and began work on new laws against computer hacking 14 15 Neal Patrick testified before the US House of Representatives on September 26 1983 about the dangers of computer hacking and six bills concerning computer crime were introduced in the House that year 15 As a result of these laws against computer criminality white hat grey hat and black hat hackers try to distinguish themselves from each other depending on the legality of their activities These moral conflicts are expressed in The Mentor s The Hacker Manifesto published 1986 in Phrack Use of the term hacker meaning computer criminal was also advanced by the title Stalking the Wily Hacker an article by Clifford Stoll in the May 1988 issue of the Communications of the ACM Later that year the release by Robert Tappan Morris Jr of the socalled Morris worm provoked the popular media to spread this usage The popularity of Stolls book The Cuckoos Egg published one year later further entrenched the term in the publics consciousness Classifications Subgroups of the computer underground with different attitudes and motives use different terms to demarcate themselves from each other These classifications are also used to exclude specific groups with whom they do not agree Cracker Eric S Raymond author of The New Hackers Dictionary advocates that members of the computer underground should be called crackers Yet those people see themselves as hackers and even try to include the views of Raymond in what they see as a wider hacker culture a view that Raymond has harshly rejected Instead of a hackercracker dichotomy they emphasize a spectrum of different categories such as white hat grey hat black hat and script kiddie In contrast to Raymond they usually reserve the term cracker for more malicious activity According to Ralph D Clifford a cracker or cracking is to gain unauthorized access to a computer in order to commit another crime such as destroying information contained in that system 16 These subgroups may also be defined by the legal status of their activities 17 White hat Main article White hat computer security A white hat hacker breaks security for nonmalicious reasons either to test their own security system perform penetration tests or vulnerability assessments for a client or while working for a security company which makes security software The term is generally synonymous with ethical hacker and the ECCouncil 18 among others have developed certifications courseware classes and online training covering the diverse arena of ethical hacking 17 Black hat Main article Black hat computer security A black hat hacker is a hacker who violates computer security for little reason beyond maliciousness or for personal gain Moore 2005 19 The term was coined by Richard Stallman to contrast the maliciousness of a criminal hacker versus the spirit of playfulness and exploration in hacker culture or the ethos of the white hat hacker who performs hacking duties to identify places to repair or as a means of legitimate employment 20 Black hat hackers form the stereotypical illegal hacking groups often portrayed in popular culture and are the epitome of all that the public fears in a computer criminal 21 Grey hat Main article Grey hat A grey hat hacker lies between a black hat and a white hat hacker A grey hat hacker may surf the Internet and hack into a computer system for the sole purpose of notifying the administrator that their system has a security defect for example They may then offer to correct the defect for a fee 21 Grey hat hackers sometimes find the defect of a system and publish the facts to the world instead of a group of people Even though grey hat hackers may not necessarily perform hacking for their personal gain unauthorized access to a system can be considered illegal and unethical Elite hacker A social status among hackers elite is used to describe the most skilled Newly discovered exploits circulate among these hackers Elite groups such as Masters of Deception conferred a kind of credibility on their members 22 Script kiddie A script kiddie also known as a skid or skiddie is an unskilled hacker who breaks into computer systems by using automated tools written by others usually by other black hat hackers hence the term script ie a computer script that automates the hacking kiddie ie kid childan individual lacking knowledge and experience immature 23 usually with little understanding of the underlying concept Neophyte A neophyte newbie or noob is someone who is new to hacking or phreaking and has almost no knowledge or experience of the workings of technology and hacking 21 Blue hat A blue hat hacker is someone outside computer security consulting firms who is used to bugtest a system prior to its launch looking for exploits so they can be closed Microsoft also uses the term BlueHat to represent a series of security briefing events 24 25 26 Hacktivist A hacktivist is a hacker who utilizes technology to publicize a social ideological religious or political message Hacktivism can be divided into two main groups Cyberterrorism Activities involving website defacement or denialofservice attacks and Freedom of information Making information that is not public or is public in nonmachinereadable formats accessible to the public Nation state Intelligence agencies and cyberwarfare operatives of nation states 27 Organized criminal gangs Groups of hackers that carry out organized criminal activities for profit 27 Attacks Main article Computer security This article is part of a series on Information security Related security categories Internet security Automotive security Cyberwarfare Computer security Mobile security Network security Threats Advanced Persistent Threat Computer crime Vulnerabilities Eavesdropping Malware Spyware Ransomware Trojans Viruses Worms Rootkits Bootkits Keyloggers Screen scrapers Exploits Backdoors Logic bombs Payloads Denial of service Web shells Phishing Defenses Computer access control Defence in Depth Application security Antivirus software Secure coding Secure by default Secure by design Secure operating systems Authentication Multifactor authentication Authorization Datacentric security Encryption Firewall Intrusion detection system Mobile secure gateway Runtime application selfprotection RASP v t e A typical approach in an attack on Internetconnected system is Network enumeration Discovering information about the intended target Vulnerability analysis Identifying potential ways of attack Exploitation Attempting to compromise the system by employing the vulnerabilities found through the vulnerability analysis 28 In order to do so there are several recurring tools of the trade and techniques used by computer criminals and security experts Security exploits Main article Exploit computer security A security exploit is a prepared application that takes advantage of a known weakness 29 Common examples of security exploits are SQL injection crosssite scripting and crosssite request forgery which abuse security holes that may result from substandard programming practice Other exploits would be able to be used through File Transfer Protocol FTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP PHP SSH Telnet and some Web pages These are very common in Web site and Web domain hacking Techniques This section does not cite any sources

Learn how and when to remove this template message Vulnerability scanner A vulnerability scanner is a tool used to quickly check computers on a network for known weaknesses Hackers also commonly use port scanners These check to see which ports on a specified computer are open or available to access the computer and sometimes will detect what program or service is listening on that port and its version number Firewalls defend computers from intruders by limiting access to ports and machines but they can still be circumvented Finding vulnerabilities Hackers may also attempt to find vulnerabilities manually A common approach is to search for possible vulnerabilities in the code of the computer system then test them sometimes reverse engineering the software if the code is not provided Experienced hackers can easily find patterns in code to find common vulnerabilities Bruteforce attack Password guessing This method is very fast when used to check all short passwords but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used because of the time a bruteforce search takes 30 Password cracking Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system Common approaches include repeatedly trying guesses for the password trying the most common passwords by hand and repeatedly trying passwords from a dictionary or a text file with many passwords Packet analyzer A packet analyzer packet sniffer is an application that captures data packets which can be used to capture passwords and other data in transit over the network Spoofing attack phishing A spoofing attack involves one program system or website that successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data and is thereby treated as a trusted system by a user or another program usually to fool programs systems or users into revealing confidential information such as user names and passwords Rootkit A rootkit is a program that uses lowlevel hardtodetect methods to subvert control of an operating system from its legitimate operators Rootkits usually obscure their installation and attempt to prevent their removal through a subversion of standard system security They may include replacements for system binaries making it virtually impossible for them to be detected by checking process tables Social engineering In the second stage of the targeting process hackers often use Social engineering tactics to get enough information to access the network They may contact the system administrator and pose as a user who cannot get access to his or her system This technique is portrayed in the 1995 film Hackers when protagonist Dade Zero Cool Murphy calls a somewhat clueless employee in charge of security at a television network Posing as an accountant working for the same company Dade tricks the employee into giving him the phone number of a modem so he can gain access to the companys computer system Hackers who use this technique must have cool personalities and be familiar with their targets security practices in order to trick the system administrator into giving them information In some cases a helpdesk employee with limited security experience will answer the phone and be relatively easy to trick Another approach is for the hacker to pose as an angry supervisor and when hisher authority is questioned threaten to fire the helpdesk worker Social engineering is very effective because users are the most vulnerable part of an organization No security devices or programs can keep an organization safe if an employee reveals a password to an unauthorized person Social engineering can be broken down into four subgroups Intimidation As in the angry supervisor technique above the hacker convinces the person who answers the phone that their job is in danger unless they help them At this point many people accept that the hacker is a supervisor and give them the information they seek Helpfulness The opposite of intimidation helpfulness exploits many peoples natural instinct to help others solve problems Rather than acting angry the hacker acts distressed and concerned The help desk is the most vulnerable to this type of social engineering as a its general purpose is to help people and b it usually has the authority to change or reset passwords which is exactly what the hacker wants 31 Namedropping The hacker uses names of authorized users to convince the person who answers the phone that the hacker is a legitimate user him or herself Some of these names such as those of webpage owners or company officers can easily be obtained online Hackers have also been known to obtain names by examining discarded documents dumpster diving Technical Using technology is also a way to get information A hacker can send a fax or email to a legitimate user seeking a response that contains vital information The hacker may claim that he or she is involved in law enforcement and needs certain data for an investigation or for recordkeeping purposes Trojan horses A Trojan horse is a program that seems to be doing one thing but is actually doing another It can be used to set up a back door in a computer system enabling the intruder to gain access later The name refers to the horse from the Trojan War with the conceptually similar function of deceiving defenders into bringing an intruder into a protected area Computer virus A virus is a selfreplicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other executable code or documents By doing this it behaves similarly to a biological virus which spreads by inserting itself into living cells While some viruses are harmless or mere hoaxes most are considered malicious Computer worm Like a virus a worm is also a selfreplicating program It differs from a virus in that a it propagates through computer networks without user intervention and b does not need to attach itself to an existing program Nonetheless many people use the terms virus and worm interchangeably to describe any selfpropagating program Keystroke logging A keylogger is a tool designed to record log every keystroke on an affected machine for later retrieval usually to allow the user of this tool to gain access to confidential information typed on the affected machine Some keyloggers use virus trojan and rootkitlike methods to conceal themselves However some of them are used for legitimate purposes even to enhance computer security For example a business may maintain a keylogger on a computer used at a point of sale to detect evidence of employee fraud Attack patterns Attack patterns are defined as series of repeatable steps that can be applied to simulate an attack against the security of a system They can be used for testing purposes or locating potential vulnerabilities They also provide either physically or in reference a common solution pattern for preventing a given attack Tools and Procedures A thorough examination of hacker tools and procedures may be found in Cengage Learnings ECSA certification workbook 32 Notable intruders and criminal hackers Main article List of computer

Mitnick and Lewis de Payne in Los Angeles but later framed them for erasing the system files at US Leasing after a falling out leading to Mitnicks first conviction 34 Gary McKinnon is a Scottish hacker who was facing extradition to the United States to face criminal charges Many people in the UK called on the authorities to be lenient with McKinnon who has Asperger syndrome The extradition has now been dropped 35 Gordon Lyon known by the handle Fyodor authored the Nmap Security Scanner as well as many network security books and web sites He is a founding member of the Honeynet Project

Intelligence James Clapper 39 40 41 Customs The computer underground 2 has produced its own specialized slang such as 1337speak Its members often advocate freedom of information strongly opposing the principles of copyright as well as the rights of free speech and privacy citation needed Writing software and performing other activities to support these views is referred to as hacktivism Some consider illegal cracking ethically justified for these goals a common form is website defacement The computer underground is frequently compared to the Wild West 42 It is common for hackers to use aliases to conceal their identities Hacker groups and conventions Main articles Hacker conference and Hacker group The computer underground is supported by regular realworld gatherings called hacker conventions or hacker cons These events include SummerCon Summer DEF CON HoHoCon Christmas ShmooCon February BlackHat Chaos Communication Congress AthCon Hacker Halted and HOPE citation needed Local Hackfest groups organize and compete to develop their skills to send a team to a prominent convention to compete in group pentesting exploit and forensics on a larger scale Hacker groups became popular in the early 1980s providing access to hacking information and resources and a place to learn from other members Computer bulletin board systems BBSs such as the Utopias provided platforms for informationsharing via dialup modem Hackers could also gain credibility by being affiliated with elite groups 43 Consequences for malicious hacking India Section Offence Punishment 65 Tampering with
