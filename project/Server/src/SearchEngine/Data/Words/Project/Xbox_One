China and other European countries in September 2014 It is the first Xbox game console to be released in China specifically in the Shanghai FreeTrade Zone Microsoft marketed the device as an allinone entertainment system hence the name Xbox One 13 14 The Xbox One mainly competes against Sony s PlayStation 4 and Nintendo s Wii U and Switch Moving away from its predecessors PowerPC based architecture the Xbox One marks a shift back to the x86 architecture used in the original Xbox it features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit APU built around the x8664 instruction set Xbox Ones controller was redesigned over the Xbox 360s with a redesigned body Dpad and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic feedback The console places an increased emphasis on cloud computing as well as social networking features and the ability to record and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay or livestream directly to streaming services such as Mixer and Twitch Games can also be played offconsole via a local area network on supported Windows 10 devices The console can play Bluray Disc and overlay live television programming from an existing settop box or a digital tuner for digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide The console optionally included a redesigned Kinect sensor marketed as the Kinect 20 providing improved motion tracking and voice recognition The Xbox One received mostly positive reviews for its refined controller design multimedia features and voice navigation Its quieter and cooler design was praised for making the console more reliable than its predecessor onlaunch but the console was generally criticized for running games at a technically lower graphical level than the PlayStation 4 Its original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive although changes made to it and other aspects of the consoles software postlaunch received a positive reception Its Kinect received praise for its improved motiontracking accuracy its face recognition logins and its voice commands The original Xbox One model was succeeded by the Xbox One S in 2016 which has a smaller form factor and support for HDR10 highdynamicrange video as well as support for 4K video playback and upscaling of games from 1080p to 4K It was praised for its smaller size its onscreen visual improvements and its lack of an external power supply but its regressions such as the lack of a native Kinect port were noted A highend model named Xbox One X was unveiled in June 2017 and released in November it features upgraded hardware specifications and

References 9 External links History Xbox One at E3 2013 alongside the Xbox 360 E model The Xbox One is the successor to Xbox 360 Microsofts previous video game console which was introduced in 2005 as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles 15 Over the years the 360 had received a number of small hardware revisions to reduce the units size and improve its reliability 16 In 2010 Microsofts Chris Lewis stated that the 360 was about halfway through its lifecycle this was aided by the introduction of the Kinect motion sensor that year which Lewis stated would extend the lifecycle by five years 17 Initial hardware for the 360s successor commonly referred to by the industry as the Xbox 720 18 was reportedly under development as early as May 2011 19 The official developer kit was codenamed Durango 20 and appeared to be available to developers by mid2012 21 Leaked documents suggested that the new console would include an improved Kinect sensor cloud access to games and media integration with phone and tablet devices and technology to provide players headsup displays on glasses worn by the player codenamed Fortaleza Microsoft did not comment on these reported features 22 Leaked design documents also suggested that Microsoft was seeking to eliminate the ability to play used games though Microsoft later clarified it was still reviewing the design and were thinking about what is next and how we can push the boundaries of technology like we did with Kinect but did not comment on the validity of the information 23 Initial unveiling and launch Prior to the official unveiling rumors had circulated that the next Xbox console would be an always on system requiring a persistent Internet connection though Microsoft had not confirmed this This had drawn some concerns from consumers which were heightened when Microsoft Studios Adam Orth stated in a Twitter message in April 2013 that said Sorry I dont get the drama around having an always on consoleEvery device now is always on Thats the world we live in dealwithit Orths message drew further ire towards Microsoft with concerns about digital rights management and practices against the sale of used games with an always on unit Orth opted to leave Microsoft a few days later due to the backlash and subsequently went to work for the studio Three One Zero for their first game Adrift 24 Despite Microsofts statements following this situation denying the rumors the mood it created lingered over the next several months 25 The new console was publicly unveiled under the name Xbox One on May 21 2013 in a press conference designed to cover the units broad multimedia and social capabilities 26 27 28 However this event focused heavily on the multimedia capabilities demonstrating integration with television over the first 30 minutes before video game capabilities were brought up 25 Not only had this approach confused consumers about the intent of the Xbox One but also Microsoft employees who had been working on the console Phil Spencer stated that several employees complained to him that they felt this presentation had blown up all the good work that theyve done by talking about the product in a way thats not really matching what the soul of an Xbox console is about and what their customers are looking for from Microsoft 25 Because of the negative feedback from the May presentation the press event for the E3 2013 was made to showcase the video game functionality of the Xbox One first and foremost Don Mattrick described the event as all about the games 25 29 At that time Microsoft announced that the console would be released in 21 different markets on November 22 2013 but this was later amended down to 13 30 31 The change which pushed the release date for the other eight markets to 2014 was attributed to unforeseen complexity in localizing the devices voice recognition capabilities 32 Later in September 2014 the Xbox One was released in 26 markets including remaining markets in Europe the Japanese market and Middle Eastern markets 30 31 33 34 35 Microsoft initially announced a different game licensing scheme for Xbox One than what was used upon its release all games including those purchased at retail would be bound to the users Xbox Live account Users could access their purchased games from any other Xbox One console play games without their disc once installed and allow users to share their games with up to ten designated family members Users would trade games at participating retailers and could also transfer a game directly to any Xbox Live friend on their list for at least 30 days but only once To synchronize licenses the console would be required to connect to the internet once every 24 hours if the console could not connect all games would be disabled until the console was connected again 36 37 38 Reaction to this digital rights management scheme was extremely negative in light of the previous concerns about the always on console from earlier in the year Critics felt that the changes would infringe on consumers firstsale rights for games purchased on physical media as games would only be licensed to users rather than sold and the disc itself would only be used to install the game and not confer ownership of its license or permission to resell Microsoft also stated that publishers could impose restrictions or activation fees on secondhand copies of games 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 GameSpot editor Tom Mcshea went on to say that Microsoft had become anticonsumerist trying to punish their loyal customers with strict restrictions and that by saying no to the used game restrictions and alwaysonline that Microsoft is so happily implementing on the Xbox One Sony has elevated the PlayStation 4 as the console to grab this holiday season 46 Xbox Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi explained that the system was built with digital distribution in mind but that Microsoft wanted to maintain the availability of games on physical media He also noted that Microsoft was not giving in to publishers objections to used games but rather trying to balance the needs of consumers and the industry and that the trading and sharing abilities of the platform added a level of flexibility not seen on other online distribution platforms at the time 47 On June 19 2013 shortly after E3 2013 Microsoft announced in response to the negative reaction that it would change its policy Xbox Ones DRM and game licensing model and reverse course 48 49 As with Xbox 360 users would be able to share and resell physical games without restrictions and beyond a mandatory software update upon the consoles initial setup process to enable playback of Bluray and DVD video 50 the console would not require a permanent internet connection to operate These changes required the family sharing features along with the ability to play games without their disc after installation to be dropped 39 51 Xbox One chief product officer Marc Whitten stated that the family sharing feature may return in the future but could not be implemented on launch due to time restraints 52 53 Don Mattrick the then president of Microsofts Interactive Entertainment Business stated that the licensing changes were in response to the negative public reaction 54 Other analysts believed that the change was in direct response of Sonys aggressive position during its E3 press conference 55 Mattrick who had been a leader in Xbox One development announced his departure from Microsoft on July 1 2013 to become CEO of Zynga Analysts speculated that his departure was predicated on the poor response and subsequent reversal of the plans for Xbox One 56 Microsoft also backtracked on a similarly controversial requirement for the Kinect sensor to be plugged into Xbox One at all times for it to function Privacy advocates argued that Kinect sensor data could be used for targeted advertising and to perform unauthorized surveillance on users In response to these claims Microsoft reiterated that Kinect voice recognition and motion tracking can be disabled by users that Kinect data cannot be used for advertising per its privacy policy and that the console would not redistribute usergenerated content without permission 57 58 59 60 61 62 In response to these prelaunch changes and a belief that Microsofts decisions for the systems were in poor judgement journalists and consumers jokingly gave Xbox One nicknames such as Xbox 180 in reference to the Xbox 360 and Microsofts decision to reverse its controversial decisions and Xbone suggesting that the company was throwing a bone to consumers by making these changes 63 64 65 66 Subsequent updates In 2015 four members of an international hacking group pleaded guilty to gaining unauthorized access to Microsofts computer network and obtaining sensitive information relating to Xbox One and Xbox Live 67 At the time of the security breach Microsoft was in the development stage for its nextgeneration gaming system Between 2011 and 2013 the hackers spent hundreds of hours searching through Microsofts network copying login credentials source code technical specifications and other data Group members say they were driven by an immense curiosity about Microsofts thenunreleased Xbox One console and associated software Using stolen access credentials two of the hackers also committed a physical theft by entering a secure building on Microsofts Redmond Washington campus and carrying away three Durango development kits 68 69 On June 13 2016 during its E3 2016 press conference Microsoft unveiled the Xbox One S a revision of the original Xbox One hardware with a streamlined form factor 70 Microsoft also teased a highend version of Xbox One with upgraded hardware codenamed Project Scorpio which was unveiled and released the following year as Xbox One X 71 On April 16 2019 Microsoft unveiled the Xbox One S AllDigital Edition which will include three digital games Forza Horizon 3 Sea of Thieves and Minecraft The console does not have a physical disc drive and all games must be downloaded It is 50 cheaper than the Xbox One S at 249 and was made available on May 7 2019 72 Hardware Design The Xbox One S features a smaller casing and other design changes over the original model The original Xbox Ones exterior casing consists of a twotone liquid black finish with half finished in a matte grey and the other in a glossier black The matte side of the top of the console consists of a large air vent The design was intended to evoke a more entertainmentoriented and simplified look than previous iterations of the console among other changes the LED rings used by Xbox 360 are replaced by a glowing white Xbox logo used to communicate the systems status to the user 73 Due to the overall ventilation design of the console the original Xbox One is designed to only sit horizontally 74 Xbox One S utilizes a refreshed version of this design with a case that is 40 smaller in size and supports vertical orientation with a stand The main Xbox One S SKU is colored in an entirely matte Robot White finish with half of the console adorned with machined holes and a visible circular vent on top of the consoles right half It utilizes pushbutton controls rather than capacitive keys 70 the side USB port and controller sync button were moved to the front of the console and its power supply is integrated into the consoles casing rather than sitting externally plugging directly into the wall 75 76 Internals The Xbox One is powered by an AMD Jaguar Accelerated Processing Unit APU with two quadcore modules totaling eight x8664 cores clocked at 175 GHz 9 77 and 8 GB of DDR3 RAM with a memory bandwidth of

be played from supported streaming services and Ultra HD Bluray Disc 97 98 99 Games are upscaled from 1080p resolution and are not rendered at 4K 70 The GPU on Xbox One S has a higher clock speed and ESRAM bandwidth than the original model which can provide some performance improvements on games with dynamic resolution scaling or uncapped frame rates 100 101 102 The console can monitor its internal temperature and adjust accordingly to prevent overheating alongside increasing fan speed additional measures can be taken including forcing the hardware to run in a lower power statea feature that was not present on Xbox 360 Restricting power consumption lowers maximum performance but the setting would be intended as a last resort to prevent permanent hardware damage 103 Controller Main article Xbox One Controller Xbox One Elite controller featuring two unique pairs of analog sticks a new Dpad and two differently sized pairs of paddles The Xbox Ones controller maintains the overall layout found in the Xbox 360s controller but with various refinements to its form Among its changes include a smoother form textured analog sticks a fourway directional pad and redesigned triggers and shoulder buttons with a curved shape for ergonomics 104 105 106 107 Menu and View buttons have replaced the Start and Back buttons 108 Each trigger features independent rumble motors called Impulse Triggers which allows developers to program directional vibration One trigger can be made to vibrate when firing a gun or both can work together to create feedback that indicates the direction of an incoming hit 109 The controller also contains light emitters that allow it to be tracked and paired using the Kinect sensor and to detect when its not being held to automatically enter a lowpower state 105 An updated revision of the controller was released in June 2015 which includes a 35millimeter headphone jack and other minor changes 110 111 A third revision was introduced alongside and

times so the console can receive voice commands from the user even when the console is in sleep mode It is possible to wake the console with a command although settings are available to change which individual Kinect functions are active 124 126 127 128 Prior to and after the mandate all Xbox One consoles initially shipped with the Kinect sensor included On June 9 2014 cheaper Xbox One bundles were introduced which did not include the Kinect sensor 129 Microsoft stated the decision to offer Xbox One bundles without Kinect was to offer a choice to people that would allow people to buy an Xbox One and then ramp up to Kinect when they can afford to while also allowing games to use processing power that was previously reserved for Kinect 130 An updated Xbox Development Kit issued in June 2014 allows developers to explicitly disable motion tracking functionality in games allowing access to additional system resources that represent about 10 of the GPU processing power These resources were previously reserved for Kinect skeletal tracking regardless of whether the Kinect sensor was attached or in use 130 A Windows compatible Kinect 20 was released on July 15 2014 131 Kinect 20 was released as a standalone and optional item in October 2014 it is bundled with a digital copy of Dance Central Spotlight 132 Xbox One S lacks the Kinect connection port requiring a USBpower adapter to

192 At its launch the Xbox One did not have native backward compatibility with original Xbox or Xbox 360 games 193 194 It had been a desired launch feature by Microsoft and had been actively under development as early as 2007 under the Trioxide program as to get Xbox 360 code to run on 64bit hardware 195 Rather than going the route of the initial PlayStation 3 which included a core PlayStation 2 systemonachip processor the Xbox One hardware was designed to include support for Xbox 360 XMA and texture processing on hardware knowing this would be difficult to replicate in software 195 Following criticism of its plan for an always on console from the May 2013 announcement Microsoft had to put significant effort to prepare the Xbox One software for a revised approach and the backwards compatibility development work were put on hold 195 Interim solutions were suggested senior project management and planning director Albert Penello explained that Microsoft was initially considering a cloud gaming platform to enable backward compatibility but he felt it would be problematic due to varying internet connection qualities 196 197 Xbox Live director of programming Larry Major Nelson Hryb did state that users could theoretically use the HDMIin port on the console to pass an Xbox 360 or alternatively any other device that supports HDMI output including competing consoles 198 through Xbox One 192 199 This process does generate a small amount of unnoticeable display lag 198 Following the release of the Xbox One and transition of Phil Spencer to the head of the Xbox division in 2014 he and software engineering vice president Kareem Choudhry restarted the backwards compatibility program in relative secret within the company Choudhry brought on previous engineers that worked on Trioxide including Kevin La Chapelle Jonathan Morrison and Barry Bond to restart the program The team chose to start with Castle Crashers which included Xbox networking features to test backwards compatibility 195 Castle Crashers frequently crashed to a screen with alphanumeric codes which La Chapelle was able to obtain from the games developers The Behemoth which helped them to rapidly diagnose problems and fix the compatibility issues 195 Solving most of the major problems through Castle Crashers the background compatibility team decided to let the program be announced at E3 2015 with plans to have one hundred titles available by the end of 2015 195 However by E3 they still found problems with some games running at extremely low framerates During the event Morrison recognized that a fundamental difference between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One was its scheduling rate and when they returned Morrisons idea helped them to rapidly complete work to meet its promised goal by the end of that year 195 Individual games still brought some difficulty specifically Halo Reach but this prompted the team to develop automatic tools that could be used to identify where Xbox 360 titles would be difficult to run asis on the Xbox One and how to work around those this further set up the potential to improve Xbox 360 games on the future iterations of the Xbox One such as the Xbox One X to improve graphics support 195 Xbox 360 backward compatibility uses Fission a software emulator within the system software 104 Xbox 360 titles were supported at the features public launch with more added in the following months 200 Xbox 360 games contained within Rare Replay are packaged as standalone applications using the Xbox 360 emulation 201 Microsoft stated that publishers would only need to provide permission to the company to allow the repackaging and it expected the number of supported games to increase significantly over time 202 203 204 Microsoft along with fourteen other thirdparty publishers will offer supported games and all Games with Gold titles on Xbox 360 since November 2015 are made compatible 174 175 On June 10 2019 Microsoft stated that it had wound down the addition of new titles to the backwards compatibility program in order to focus on Xbox Ones successor 205 206 Original Xbox compatibility The first Xbox videogame revealed to be compatible with the Xbox One was Crimson Skies High Road to Revenge Xbox division head Phil Spencer had also hinted the possibility of adding support for games from the original Xbox 207 For the backwards compatibility team after they completed the framework for Xbox 360 compatibility so that other engineering teams could take over they turned to the question of compatibility with the original Xbox console The program was started in November 2016 under the code name Fusion and was led by software engineer Spencer Perreault 195 Perreault initially tried the same approaches as the team had done with Fission but due to the differences in memory management sizes and chipset bitrates these initial tests failed Instead Perreault worked to bring Dolphin a developer tool for the original Xbox working to get its emulation correct La Chapelle brought in a number of personal Xbox titles to test in Perreaults emulation getting about a 10 hit rate on successes though the variety of failures helped Perreault to identify common problems and within a month had improved the successful hit rate to about 90 195 As with Xbox 360 backwards compatibility the Fusion emulation enables Xbox games to be scaled to 1080p resolutions work with Xbox One networking features and can allow mixedconsole System Link connection between all three generations of Xbox 195 With Perreaults success Microsoft announced the Xbox backwards compatibility on the Xbox One in June 2017 208 Thirteen titles were initially released on October 24 2017 209 Microsoft announced an additional 19 titles to be added to the Xbox One service during April 2018 210 Microsoft does not anticipate that there will be as many Xbox titles brought to the program as with the Xbox 360 primarily due to legal issues related to intellectual property contracts and companies that have since gone defunct 195 Reception Prerelease While the initial unveiling of the Xbox One in May 2013 created criticism that led to significant changes in the digital rights management scheme it would use other features of the console were highlighted by journalists The editorial staff of Game Informer offered both praise and criticism for the console Matt Helgeson described the console as Microsofts intent to control the living room He called Xbox Ones instant switching features impressive and that the console was a step in the right direction with regards to TV entertainment especially the prospect of avoiding the usage of nonintuitive user interfaces often found on cable settop boxes Jeff Cork said that Microsoft had some great ideas for the console but that it failed to properly communicate them 211 Microsofts E3 2013 press conference was criticized for focusing too much on games that beyond increased graphical capabilities provided experiences that were otherwise similar to previousgeneration gamesgiving little incentive for buying the new console 212 213 Rafi Mohammed author of The Art of Pricing felt that Microsoft priced Xbox One too high and that the 100 premium over its competitor could derail the system during the 2013 holiday season 214 215 Critical reception Upon its release the Xbox One received favorable reviews from critics and reviewers In its launch review Polygon gave the Xbox One an 810 Its design was described as inoffensive but its larger size noted while the consoles quieter and cooler operation was praised for indicating a potentially higher reliability than Xbox 360 was onlaunch The controller was praised for its battery life and premium design but some members of the sites staff felt that its shoulder buttons were stiffer than that of previous designs The design of Xbox Ones interface received mixed reviews noting that it carried over Windows 8 s design language the interface was disfavored for hiding functions under the controllers menu button and for being awkward to use with a controller or motion gestures seemingly encouraging users to use voice navigation instead While praised for having more robust voice navigation than Xbox 360 they felt that voice navigation still had a learning curve in understanding what works and what doesnt Although its user following Smart Match and improved voice chat features were noted Xbox Live was panned for not offering the option onlaunch to add a real name to user profiles Despite a regression in local and network multimedia functionality in comparison to Xbox 360 and how OneGuide interacted with outside settop boxes drawing comparisons to the operations of TiVo DVRs Polygon felt the Xbox Ones overall multimedia experience feels like a major step forward in settop boxes and makes the Xbox One the obvious center of any living room that has one 216 Ben Gilbert of Engadget was similarly modest upon its launch assigning the console a score of 81100 and describing the Xbox Ones design as a 1993 artists rendering of 2013s technology Acknowledging that its controller was a mere refinement of the ubiquitous Xbox 360 design he praised the controller for its improved Dpad and quieter triggers but criticized its stiff shoulder buttons Kinect received positive reviews for its face recognition login and improved motion tracking but that whilst magical every false positive or unrecognized voice command had us reaching for the controller The overall interface was also considered more intuitive and flexible than that of PlayStation 4 but its game library view was described as being a jumbled sadly unfilterable rows of every owned piece of software that also knowingly listed games that require their disc to run alongside those which did not The console was also panned for missing certain promised features onlaunch such as Upload Studio game streaming and certain appsservices 217 Later on critics felt that the Xbox Ones functionality had matured over the year following its launch Jeff Bakalar of CNET assigning it a score of 810 acknowledged improvements to Xbox Ones software since its original release but that its user interface was still unintuitive in comparison to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4 explaining that navigating the interface seems to be much more problematic than it rightfully should be and theres simply not enough transparency in the logic within it There are oddities peppered throughout which is the root for countless headaches and frustrations Xbox Ones ingame performance was mixed with some titles showing slower performance over PS4 but some multiplatform games performing better on Xbox One than PS4 CNET praised the wider lineup of multimedia services and apps on Xbox One over PS4 not requiring Xbox Live Gold for online save data storage support for highspeed USB 30 as secondary storage and having a slightly better lineup of upcoming exclusives concluding that While the PS4 had a clear advantage at launch that edge is slowly evaporating as Microsoft has worked feverishly to undo most of the Xbox Ones original missteps 218 Nick Pino of TechRadar giving it four stars out of five similarly felt that the Xbox One felt more like a media titan today than it did 12 months ago citing OneGuide Upload Studio and Microsofts decision to drop the Xbox Live Gold requirement for multimedia streaming apps and that theres still a lot of potential locked away inside the hardware of the system that developers are just beginning to figure out So while PlayStation might have the upper hand for now when it comes to certain thirdparty titles it may not always remain that way Just how Microsoft will get it to that point though is still a mystery However he disfavored the consoles dependence upon a subscription for most of its functionality Kinects voice recognition and that some games do not natively run at 1080p resolution but are upscaled 137 In an August 2016 review of the Xbox One S model TechRadar further commended Microsofts recent improvements to Xbox One citing a strong lineup of firstparty titles in 2015 and further improvements to the consoles interface 70 Alaina Yee of IGN also praised how Xbox One had evolved since its launch assigning it with Kinect a score of 8110 and acknowledging that Microsoft had made good on its promise of listening to consumers rolling out a steady stream of updates that have both broadened and deepened what this third Xbox console offers Regarding the consoles slightly lower level of graphics capabilities in comparison to PlayStation 4 it was noted that while videophiles might spot instances of upscaled graphics and less detailed environments immediately most people generally wont notice a difference between Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of a game when there is one unless they see both running side by side and examples of gorgeous Xbox One games were noted such as Sunset Overdrive and Forza Motorsport 5 The number of hidden options in Xbox Ones user interface was equated to hunting for treasure in a messy room as such Kinect voice commands in combination with access to common functions within the Xbox SmartGlass app were praised for helping to provide a more streamlined user experience 219 The Xbox One S revision was critically praised for its improvements over the original model including its streamlined design the addition of HDR and 4K video support and visual improvements on some games such as Fallout 4 and Rise of the Tomb Raider when upscaled to 4K However TechRadar noted regressions such as the lack of a Kinect port considered one last kick in the pants for all the gamers forced into buying the more expensive console bundle two short years ago and concerns that the revised hardware and HDR support would lead to fragmentation of Xbox Ones ecosystem as not all users will necessarily experience a game the same way 70 Dieter Bohn of The Verge similarly felt that although it was one of the cheapest 4K Bluray players on the market consumers were more interested in streaming 4K content which could be accomplished with cheaper digital media players than 4K Bluray discs and noted the small number of HDRenabled games on launch Bohn concluded that the Xbox One S would appeal best to new owners or those who wish to leverage its HDR and 4K support but recommended that existing owners consider Xbox One X instead 220 221 Lack of exclusive titles The Xbox One platform has faced criticism for lacking in exclusive releases over competitors such as PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch Although there have been releases in flagship Microsoft franchises such as Forza and Halo they have underperformed in comparison to other entries while several major Xbox One exclusives have faced notable delays such as Crackdown 3 or outright cancellations including Fable Legends and Scalebound 222 By contrast PS4 and Switch have seen a large number of critically successful first and thirdparty exclusives and Activision would sign with Sony Interactive Entertainment for timed exclusivity on certain addon content in the Call of Duty and Destiny franchisesthe former having replaced a previous deal with Microsoft 223 224 An analyst also noted that Microsofts firstparty studios were not as strong as those of Sony explaining that Sony has always been about first party and Microsoft wanted to emulate that but they allowed studios like Rare and Lionhead to fade away 225 In 2018 Microsoft acquired a large number of thirdparty studios including Compulsion Games InXile Entertainment Ninja Theory Obsidian Entertainment Playground Games and Undead Labs and hired former Crystal Dynamics head Darrell Gallagher to lead a new Microsoft studio known as The Initiative 226 227 In 2016 Microsoft began to make future Xbox Oneexclusive firstparty releases simultaneously available on Windows 10 PCs with digital crossbuy support via Microsoft Store under the branding Xbox Play Anywhere This thus makes the games Microsoft platform exclusives rather than Xbox One exclusives 228 229 Microsoft has used the branding console launch exclusive to refer to titles such as PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds that are timed or permanent exclusives to Xbox console hardware but were already available on or are planned to be available on PC 230 Microsoft initially imposed policies referred to as the parity clause on indie games which required that the Xbox One version of a game be released at the same time as versions on other platforms Phil Spencer stated that this rule was intended to ensure that Xbox One was a firstclass platform by discouraging staggered releases However these policies resulted in some studios such as Vlambeer developer of Nuclear Throne choosing to negotiate console exclusivity with Sony instead who proved to be more receptive to indie development By July 2015 Microsoft had changed its policies in response to the criticism with Spencer admitting that this policy was onerous on smaller studios Spencer also stated that Microsoft was willing to work with studios to help make the Xbox launches of former timed exclusives special in some way so that customers are not simply purchasing last years game 231 232 Sales Microsoft only publicized its sales figures during the first year after release The last official figure was released in November 2014 with the company announcing in October 2015 that it would no longer publish sales figures for the system 233 On November 22 2013 Microsoft confirmed that it had sold one million Xbox One consoles within its first 24 hours of being available 234 Based on approximately 102000 shopping receipts tracked by InfoScout 1500 of which included a purchase of either a video game or a video game console the Xbox One was the highestselling console during the Black Friday sales period in the United States 235 On December 11 2013 Microsoft announced that it had sold approximately 2 million units in its first 18 days on sale 236 On December 12 2013 Microsoft announced it was the fastest selling console in the United States based on NPD Group figures however the NPD report clarified PlayStation 4 sales included an additional week within the November data month compared to Xbox One When looking at sales on an average perweek basis Xbox One led PS4 Keep in mind however that supply typically becomes constrained in the second week after launch 237 238 On January 6 2014 Microsoft announced that approximately 3 million consoles had been sold worldwide in 2013 239 In their Q2 2014 earnings report on January 23 2014 Microsoft announced that 39 million Xbox One units had been shipped worldwide 240 On November 12 2014 Microsoft announced it had shipped almost 10 million units to retailers worldwide The company also revealed that a price cut had tripled US sales of the console over the previous week 6 241 242 On December 11 2014 Microsoft announced based on NPD Group figures that Xbox One was the bestselling console in November 2014 243 With Microsofts October 2015 announcement that it would no longer publish sales figures for the system the 10 million figure from November 2014 is still the latest official cumulative sales number 233 Some journalists think that its lower sales figures than rival PlayStation 4 is the reason behind the decision to make their system not look bad compared to Sonys 244 The Xbox One has sold poorly in Japan continuing the trend of Microsofts previous consoles which have struggled against the local Sony and Nintendo The Xbox One sold a total figure of 23562 consoles within its launch week By comparison the Xbox 360 sold 62000 consoles in Japan during its opening week in 2005 245 246 In the week ending June 14 2015 the Xbox One sold just 100 consoles in Japan in the same week the Wii U sold 16413 consoles 247 In January 2016 the CFO of Electronic Arts reported during a financial call that the Xbox One has sold around 18 to 19 million units 248 This is half of the 36 million units of the PlayStation 4 that Sony claimed at the time but higher than that of the Xbox Ones other main competitor Nintendos Wii U which sold 125 million units 249 250 Research firm IHS Markit estimated 391million units were sold by the end of March 2018 251 Video game industry analyst Daniel Ahmad estimated that approximately 41 million units had been sold through 2018 252 According to the International Data Corporation of the 469 million Xbox Ones sold worldwide through the second quarter of 2019 just 03 of them have been in Japan 253 At Turtle Beach Corporation Q3 2019 earnings call Xbox One sales reached 50 million 254 Retail configurations Firstgeneration On launch Xbox One was available in a single retail configuration which included the console with 500GB hard drive one controller and Kinect sensor In the United States it retailed for US 499 255 On June 9 2014 Microsoft released a new Xbox One retail configuration that excludes the Kinect sensor costing US399 A standalone Kinect sensor for Xbox One for use with these models was released in October

Master Chief Collection 110 111 In May 2016 Microsoft lowered the price of selected 500GB bundles to US299 and 1TB bundles to US319 as a limited time offer of unspecified length 257 258 On June 14 2016 the price of 500GB models was lowered once more to US279 through October 2016 in anticipation of the launch of Xbox One S 259 On August 31 2015 Microsoft announced Xbox One Elitea new SKU with a 1TB solidstate hybrid drive and an Elite controller It was released in November 2015 and retails for US49999 In the US the Elite bundle was a timed exclusive to GameStop and Microsoft Store 260

Microsoft announced that it would for a limited time offer a financing program known as Xbox All Access through Microsoft Store in the United States The program will allow users to purchase an Xbox One S or X console bundled with subscriptions to both Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass financed over a twoyear contract The customer retains ownership of the console after the two years and if they break contract prior to that they must pay the difference on the remaining console cost The pricing is set to be cheaper overall than purchasing the individual elements alone 272 273 Hardware revisions Xbox One S The Xbox One S is available in 500GB 1TB and a special edition 2TB model which originally retailed at US299 349 and 399 respectively The 2TB model was released on August 2 2016 97

Minecraft and Sea of Thieves The console was released on May 7 2019 283 It has been suggested that this article be split into multiple articles Discuss November 2019 Xbox One X An Xbox One X Microsoft first teased the Xbox One X a highend hardware revision of the Xbox One at E3 2016 under the codename Project Scorpio and released it on November 7 2017 with a 1 TB model priced at US499 284 and a limited preorder exclusive Project Scorpio Edition with a darkgradient finish vertical standbrace and green Project Scorpio inscriptions on the console and bundled controller 285 286 Like the Xbox One S the Xbox One X also includes a UHD Bluray player The Xbox One X features upgraded hardware designed primarily to render games at 4K resolution and to provide performance improvements for existing games 284 they can be displayed at full resolution on 4K displays or supersampled for lowerresolution displays 284 It uses a systemonchip SoC known as Scorpio Engine which incorporates a 23GHz octacore CPU and a Radeon GPU with 40 Compute Units clocked at 1172MHz generating 6 teraflops of graphical computing performance It also includes 12GB of GDDR5 RAM with 9GB allocated to games 287 Scorpio Engines CPU utilizes a custom platform designed to maintain compatibility with the Jaguar CPU of the original Xbox One but with a 31 increase in performance the custom platform is unrelated to AMDs current Ryzen architecture The console uses a vaporchamber method of cooling for the SoC and motherboards tailored to the exact voltage needs of each individual Scorpio SoC to optimize their output and energy usage 288 The console also supports AMDs FreeSync technology 1440p resolution andor 120Hz refresh rate on compatible displays 289 290 The Xbox One X is compatible with all existing Xbox One software and accessories 291 To assist in optimizing the new hardware to run existing games at 4K resolution Microsoft developers used internal debugging software to collect GPU traces from major titles that did not run at full 1080p resolution on the original Xbox One 288 Halo 5 Guardians which uses a scaling system that dynamically lowers the games resolution when needed to maintain a consistent frame rate 292 was able to run at its native resolution with no scaling on Xbox One X hardware 291 Phil Spencer touted that Xbox One Xs hardware could also support virtual reality due to its power price point and convenience 291 At the 2017 Game Developers Conference Microsoft announced plans to support Windows Mixed Reality VR headsets on Xbox One in 2018 but the company later stated that it was initially focusing on PC platforms first and that it wanted to focus on wireless VR solutions for consoles 293 294 Games marketed by Microsoft as Xbox One X Enhanced have specific optimizations for graphical fidelity on the consoles hardware Separate iconography denotes games that natively run at 4K resolution or support HDR 188 Existing games can be updated to provide these enhancements 71 284 Though Xbox Games marketing head Aaron Greenberg stated that Xbox One X will have no exclusive titles 295 general manager of game publishing Shannon Loftis remarked in a followup interview that she was not sure on this point and exclusivity would be up to the game development community what do they want to do 296 The Xbox One X has been characterized by whom as a competitor to the PlayStation 4 Pro a hardware update of the PlayStation 4 released in late 2016 that similarly focuses on 4K gaming and improved virtual reality performance although Phil Spencer stated that the PlayStation 4 Pros competition is instead the Xbox One S 297 In October 2016 Penello stated that the performance advantage of the Xbox One X over the PS4 Pro would be obvious noting that the PS4 Pros GPU only had 42 teraflops of graphical computing performance in comparison to Microsofts stated 6 teraflops 298 299 Some journalists thought that Microsofts messaging and positioning of Scorpio alongside the release of the Xbox One S were at odds with themselves and confusing 300 301 Hardware comparison Xbox One Xbox One S Xbox One S AllDigital Xbox One X Kinect a Release 500GB Nov 22 2013
