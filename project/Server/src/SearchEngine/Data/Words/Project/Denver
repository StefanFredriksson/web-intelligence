1882 The Bronco Buster a variation of Frederic Remington s Bronco Buster western sculpture at the Denver capitol grounds a gift from JK Mullen in 1920 In the summer of 1858 during the Pikes Peak Gold Rush a group of gold prospectors from Lawrence Kansas established Montana City as a mining town on the banks of the South Platte River in what was then western Kansas Territory This was the first historical settlement in what was later to become the city of Denver The site faded quickly however and by the summer of 1859 it was abandoned in favor of Auraria named after the goldmining town of Auraria Georgia and St Charles City 23 On November 22 1858 contradictory General William Larimer and Captain Jonathan Cox Esquire both land speculators from eastern Kansas Territory placed cottonwood logs to stake a claim on the bluff overlooking the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek across the creek from the existing mining settlement of Auraria and on the site of the existing townsite of St Charles Larimer named the townsite Denver City to curry favor with Kansas Territorial Governor James W Denver 24 Larimer hoped the towns name would help it be selected as the county seat of Arapaho County but unbeknownst to him Governor Denver had already resigned from office The location was accessible to existing trails and was across the South Platte River from the site of seasonal encampments of the Cheyenne and Arapaho The site of these first towns is now occupied by Confluence Park near downtown Denver Larimer along with associates in the St Charles City Land Company sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners with the intention of creating a major city that would cater to new immigrants Denver City was a frontier town with an economy based on servicing local miners with gambling saloons livestock and goods trading In the early years land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by miners in Auraria 24 In May 1859 Denver City residents donated 53 lots to the Leavenworth Pikes Peak Express in order to secure the regions first overland wagon route Offering daily service for passengers mail freight and gold the Express reached Denver on a trail that trimmed westward travel time from twelve days to six In 1863 Western Union furthered Denvers dominance of the region by choosing the city for its regional terminus The Colorado Territory was created on February 28 1861 25 Arapahoe County was formed on November 1 1861 25 and Denver City was incorporated on November 7 1861 26 Denver City served as the Arapahoe County Seat from 1861 until consolidation in 1902 27 In 1867 Denver City became the acting territorial capital and in 1881 was chosen as the permanent state capital in a statewide ballot With its newfound importance Denver City shortened its name to Denver 27 On August 1 1876 Colorado was admitted to the Union Pioneer Mothers of Colorado statue at The Denver Post building Although by the close of the 1860s Denver residents could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center the decision to route the nations first transcontinental railroad through Cheyenne rather than Denver threatened the prosperity of the young town The transcontinental railroad passed a daunting 100 miles away but citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to it Spearheaded by visionary leaders including Territorial Governor John Evans David Moffat and Walter Cheesman fundraising began Within three days 300000 had been raised and citizens were optimistic Fundraising stalled before enough was raised forcing these visionary leaders to take control of the debtridden railroad Despite challenges on June 24 1870 citizens cheered as the Denver Pacific completed the link to the transcontinental railroad ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver 28 Finally linked to the rest of the nation by rail Denver prospered as a service and supply center The young city grew during these years attracting millionaires with their mansions as well as a mixture of crime and poverty of a rapidly growing city Denver citizens were proud when the rich chose Denver and were thrilled when Horace Tabor the Leadville mining millionaire built an impressive business block at 16th and Larimer as well as the elegant Tabor Grand Opera House Luxurious hotels including the muchloved Brown Palace Hotel soon followed as well as splendid homes for millionaires such as the Croke Patterson Campbell Mansion at 11th and Pennsylvania and the nowdemolished Moffat Mansion at 8th and Grant 29 Intent on transforming Denver into one of the worlds great cities leaders wooed industry and attracted laborers to work in these factories Soon in addition to the elite and a large middle class Denver had a growing population of immigrant German Italian and Chinese laborers soon followed by African Americans from the Deep South and Hispanic workers The influx of the new residents strained available housing In addition the Silver Crash of 1893 unsettled political social and economic balances Competition among the different ethnic groups was often expressed as bigotry and social tensions gave rise to the Red Scare Americans were suspicious of immigrants who were sometimes allied with socialist and labor union causes After World War I a revival of the Ku Klux Klan attracted white nativeborn Americans who were anxious about the many changes in society Unlike the earlier organization that was active in the rural South KKK chapters developed in urban areas of the Midwest and West including Denver and into Idaho and Oregon Corruption and crime also developed in Denver 30 Panorama print of Denver 1898 Between 1880 and 1895 the city underwent a huge rise in corruption as crime bosses such as Soapy Smith worked side by side with elected officials and the police to control elections gambling and bunco gangs 31 The city also suffered a depression in 1893 after the crash of silver prices In 1887 the precursor to the international charity United Way was formed in Denver by local religious leaders who raised funds and coordinated various charities to help Denvers poor 32 By 1890 Denver had grown to be the secondlargest city west of Omaha Nebraska 33 In 1900 whites represented 968 of Denvers population 34 The African American and Hispanic populations increased with migrations of the 20th century Many African Americans first came as workers on the railroad which had a terminus in Denver and began to settle there Between the 1880s and 1930s Denvers floriculture industry developed and thrived 35 36 This period became known locally as the Carnation Gold Rush 37 A bill proposing a state constitutional amendment to allow home rule for Denver and other municipalities was introduced in the legislature in 1901 and passed The measure called for a statewide referendum which voters approved in 1902 On December 1 that year Governor James Orman proclaimed the amendment part of the states fundamental law The City and County of Denver came into being on that date and was separated from Arapahoe and Adams Counties 8 9 38 Early in the 20th century Denver like many other cities was home to a pioneering Brass Era car company The Colburn Automobile Company made cars copied from one of its contemporaries Renault 39 From 1953 to 1989 the Rocky Flats Plant a DOE nuclear weapon facility that was about 15 miles from Denver produced fissile plutonium pits for nuclear warheads A major fire at the facility in 1957 as well as leakage from nuclear waste stored at the site between 1958 and 1968 resulted in the contamination of some parts of Denver to varying degrees with plutonium239 a harmful radioactive substance with a halflife of 24200 years 40 A 1981 study by the Jefferson County health director Dr Carl Johnson linked the contamination to an increase in birth defects and cancer incidence in central Denver and nearer Rocky Flats Later studies confirmed many of his findings 41 42 43 Plutonium contamination was still present outside the former plant site as of August2010 update 44 It presents risks to building the envisioned Jefferson Parkway 45 which would

part of the Brown Palace Hotel and Cosmopolitan Hotel since demolished In 1970 Denver was selected to host the 1976 Winter Olympics to coincide with Colorados centennial celebration but in November 1972 Colorado voters struck down ballot initiatives allocating public funds to pay for the high costs of the games They were moved to Innsbruck Austria 46 The notoriety of becoming the only city ever to decline to host an Olympiad after being selected has made subsequent bids difficult The movement against hosting the games was based largely on environmental issues and was led by State Representative Richard Lamm He was subsequently elected to three terms 197587 as Colorado governor 47 Denver explored a potential bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics 48 but no bid was submitted 49 In 2010 Denver adopted a comprehensive update of its zoning code 50 The new zoning was developed to guide development as envisioned in adopted plans such as Blueprint Denver 51 Transit Oriented Development Strategic Plan Greenprint Denver and the Strategic Transportation Plan Denver has hosted the Democratic National Convention twice in 1908 and again in 2008 It promoted the city on the national political and socioeconomic stage 52 On August 1015 1993 Denver hosted the Catholic Churchs 6th World Youth Day which was attended by an estimated 500000 making it the largest gathering in

neighborhoods that the city and community groups use for planning and administration 55 Although the citys delineation of the neighborhood boundaries is somewhat arbitrary it corresponds roughly to the definitions used by residents These neighborhoods should not be confused with cities or suburbs which may be separate entities within the metro area The character of the neighborhoods varies significantly from one to another and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern suburbanstyle developments Generally the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser older and contain more brick building material Many neighborhoods away from the city center were developed after World War II and are built with more modern materials and style Some of the neighborhoods even farther from the city center or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods Denver does not have larger area designations unlike the City of Chicago which has larger areas that house the neighborhoods IE Northwest Side Denver residents use the terms north south east and west 56 Construction along Cherokee Street in the Golden Triangle neighborhood Denver also has a number of neighborhoods not reflected in the administrative boundaries These neighborhoods may reflect the way people in an area identify themselves or they might reflect how others such as real estate developers have defined those areas Wellknown nonadministrative neighborhoods include the historic and trendy LoDo short for Lower Downtown part of the citys Union Station neighborhood Uptown straddling North Capitol Hill and City Park

climate zone Köppen climate classification BSk 58 Despite having a partially dry climate data from the University of Melbourne shows that Denver is influenced by other climates that are possibly a consequence of the adjacent elevation that changes precipitation and temperature Humid continental and subtropical microclimates can be found 59 60 It has four distinct seasons and receives most of its precipitation from April through August Due to its inland location on the High Plains at the foot of the Rocky Mountains the region can be subject to sudden changes in weather 61 July is the warmest month with an average high temperature of 88F 311C 62 Summers range from warm to hot with occasional sometimes severe afternoon thunderstorms and high temperatures reaching 90F 32C on 38 days annually and occasionally 100F 38C December the coldest month of the year has an average daily high temperature of 46F 78C Winters consist of periods of snow and very low temperatures alternating with periods of milder weather due to the warming effect of Chinook winds In winter daytime highs can exceed 60F 16C but also often fail to reach 32F 0C during periods of cold weather and can even fail to rise above 0F 18C on occasion 63 On the coldest nights of the year lows can easily fall to 10F 23C or below Snowfall is common throughout the late fall winter and early spring averaging 535 inches

65 Extremes in temperature range from 29F 34C on January 9 1875 up to 105F 41C as recently as June 29 2018 66 Due to the citys high elevation and aridity diurnal temperature variation is large throughout the year Tornadoes are rare west of the I25 corridor however one notable exception was an F3 tornado that struck 44 miles south of downtown on June 15 1988 On the other hand the suburbs east of Denver and the citys eastnortheastern extension Denver International Airport can see a few tornadoes often weak landspout tornadoes each spring and summer especially during June with the

northeastsouthwest and northwestsoutheast This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal if the streets were in a normal NSEW grid only the NS streets would receive sunlight With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions the NWSE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NESW streets receive it in the afternoon This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the Brown Palace Hotel There is now a plaque across the street from the Brown Palace Hotel that honors this idea The NWSE streets are numbered while the NESW streets are named The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the blocklong Cheyenne Place The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I25 viaducts There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid such as Park Avenue Morrison Road and Speer Boulevard Larimer Street named after William Larimer Jr the founder of Denver which is in the heart of LoDo is the oldest street in Denver Speer Boulevard runs north and south through downtown Denver All roads in the downtown grid system are streets eg 16th Street Stout Street Roads outside that system that travel eastwest are given the suffix avenue and those that head north and south are given the street suffix eg Colfax Avenue Lincoln Street Boulevards are higher capacity streets and travel any direction more commonly north and south Smaller roads are sometimes referred to as places drives though not all drives are smaller capacity roads some are major thoroughfares or courts Most streets outside the area between Broadway and Colorado Boulevard are organized alphabetically from the citys center Some Denver streets have bicycle lanes leaving a patchwork of disjointed routes throughout the city There are over 850 miles 144 of paved offroad bike paths in Denver parks and along bodies of water like Cherry Creek and the South Platte This allows for a significant portion of Denvers population to be bicycle commuters and has led to Denver being known as a bicyclefriendly city 145 Some residents are very opposed to bike lanes which have caused some plans to be watered down or nixed The review process for one bike line on Broadway will last over a year before city council members will make a decision In addition to the many bike paths Denver launched BCycle a citywide bicycle sharing program in late April 2010 The BCycle network was the largest in the United States at the time of its launch boasting 400 bicycles 146 The Denver Boot a cardisabling device was first used in Denver 147 Cycling edit The League of American Bicyclists has rated Colorado as the sixth most bicyclefriendly state in the nation for the year 2014 This is due in large part to Front Range cities like Boulder Fort Collins and Denver placing an emphasis on legislation programs and infrastructure developments that promote cycling as a mode of transportation 148 Walk score has rated Denver as the fourth most bicyclefriendly large city in the United States 149 According to data from the 2011 American Community Survey Denver ranks 6th among US cities with populations over 400000 in terms of the percentage of workers who commute by bicycle at 22 of commuters 150 BCycle Denvers citywide bicycle sharing program was the largest in the United States at the time of its launch in 2010 boasting 400 bicycles 146 BCycle ridership peaked in 2014 then steadily declined The program announced it would cease operations at the end of January 2020 151 152 153 The city announced plans to seek one or more new contractors to run a bikeshare program starting mid2020 154 Electric rental scooters edit In 2018 electric scooter services began to place scooters in Denver Hundreds of unsanctioned LimeBike and Bird electric scooters appeared on Denver streets in May causing an uproar In June the city ordered the companies to remove them 155 and acted quickly to create an official program making a requirement that scooters be left at RTD stops and out of the public rightofway Lime and Bird scooters then reappeared in late July with limited compliance Uber s Jump ebikes arrived in late August followed by Lyft s nationwide electric scooter launch in early September 156 Lyft plans to offer ridesharing electric scooter and ebike services all from its app It says that it will each night take the scooters to the warehouse for safety checks maintenance and charging Additionally Spin and Razor each were permitted to add 350 scooters 157 Walkability edit 2017 rankings by Walk Score placed Denver twentysixth among 108 US cities with a population of 200000 or greater 149 City leaders have acknowledged the concerns of walkability advocates that Denver has serious gaps in its sidewalk network The 2019 Denver Moves Pedestrians plan outlines a need for approximate 13 billion in sidewalk funding plus 400 million for trails 158 Denver does not currently have resources to fully fund this plan 159 Modal characteristics edit In 2015 96 percent of Denver households lacked a car and in 2016 this was virtually unchanged 94 percent The national average was 87 percent in 2016 Denver averaged 162 cars per household in 2016 compared to a national average of 18 160 Freeways and highways edit Denver is primarily served by the interstate freeways I25 and I70 The problematic intersection of the two interstates is referred to locally as the mousetrap because when viewed from the air the junction and subsequent vehicles resemble mice in a large trap Interstate 25 runs northsouth from New Mexico through Denver to Wyoming Interstate 225 traverses neighboring Aurora I225 was designed to link Aurora with I25 in the southeastern corner of Denver and I70 to the north of Aurora with construction starting May 1964 and ending May 21 1976 Interstate 70 runs eastwest from Utah to Maryland It is also the primary corridor on which Denverites access the mountains A proposed 12 billion widening of an urban portion through a primarily lowincome and Latino community has been met with community protests and calls to reroute the interstate along the less urban Interstate 270 alignment They cite increased pollution and the negative effects of tripling the interstates large footprint through the neighborhood as primary objections The affected neighborhood bisected by the Interstate was also designated the most polluted neighborhood in the country and is home to a Superfund site 161 Interstate 270 runs concurrently with US 36 from an interchange with Interstate 70 in northeast Denver to an interchange with Interstate 25 north of Denver The freeway continues as US 36 from the interchange with Interstate 25 Interstate 76 begins from I70 just west of the city in Arvada It intersects I25 north of the city and runs northeast to Nebraska where it ends at I80 US 6 follows the alignment of 6th Avenue west of I25 and connects downtown Denver to the westcentral suburbs of Golden and Lakewood It continues west through Utah and Nevada to Bishop California To the east it continues as far as Provincetown on Cape Cod in Massachusetts US 285 ends its 847 Mile route through New Mexico and Texas at Interstate 25 in the University Hills Neighborhood US 85 also travels through Denver This Highway is often used as an alternate route to Castle Rock instead of taking Interstate 25 US 36 connects Denver to Boulder and Rocky Mountain National Park near Estes Park It runs east into Ohio after crossing four other states State Highway 93 starts in the Western Metropolitan area in Golden Colorado and travels almost 19 miles to meet with SH119 in central Boulder This highway is often used as an alternate route to Boulder instead of taking US 36 State Highway 470 C470 SH 470 is the southwestern portion of the Denver metro areas beltway Originally planned as Interstate 470 in the 1960s the beltway project was attacked on environmental impact grounds and the interstate beltway was never built The portion of Interstate 470 built as a state highway is the presentday SH 470 which is a freeway for its entire length Denver also has a nearly complete beltway known as the 470s These are SH 470 also known as C470 a freeway in the southwest Metro area and two toll highways E470 from southeast to northeast and Northwest Parkway from terminus of E470 to US 36 SH 470 was intended to be I470 and built with federal highway funds but the funding was redirected to complete conversion of downtown Denvers 16th Street to a pedestrian mall As a result construction was delayed until 1980 after state and local legislation was passed 162 I470 was also once called The Silver Stake Highway from Gov Lamms declared intention to drive a silver stake through it and kill it A highway expansion and transit project for the southern I25 corridor dubbed TREX Transportation Expansion Project was completed on November 17 2006 163 The project installed wider and additional highway lanes and improved highway access and drainage The project also includes a light rail line that traverses from downtown to the south end of the metro area at Lincoln Avenue 164 The project spanned almost 19 miles 31km along the highway with an additional line traveling parallel to part of I225 stopping just short of Parker Road Metro Denver highway conditions can be accessed on the Colorado Department of Transportation website Traffic Conditions 165 Mass transportation edit Denver RTD Light Rail car at the Colfax at Auraria station Denver Union

commuter rail lines are planned to open in the near future with the G Line to the suburb of Arvada opening on April 26 2019 after being originally planned to open in the Fall of 2016 168 and the N Line to Commerce City and Thornton currently estimated to be open in Spring 2020 169 An express bus service known as the Flatiron Flyer serves to connect Boulder and Denver The service billed as bus rapid transit has been accused of bus rapid transit creep for failing to meet the majority of BRT requirements including level boarding and alldoor entry A commuter rail connection to Boulder and its suburb of Longmont also part of the FasTracks ballot initiative and an extension of the B Line is planned to be finished by RTD but no construction funds have yet been identified prior to 2040 170 RTD

Ski Train operated on the former Denver Rio Grande Western Railroad which took passengers between Denver and the Winter Park Ski Resort but it is no longer in service The Ski Train made its final run to Winter Park on March 29 2009 The service was revived on a trial basis in 2016 with a great amount of local fanfare Further development of a mountain corridor rail option though publicly popular has been met with resistance from politicians namely the director of Colorado Department of Transportation 173 failed verification The Ski Train did return to service under Amtrak with the name Winter Park Express in 2017 and currently runs only on Saturdays Sundays and major holidays during the winter ski seasons Denvers early years as a major train hub of the west are still very visible today Trains stop in Denver at historic Union Station where travelers can access RTDs 16th Street Free MallRide or use light rail to tour the city Union Station will also serve as the main juncture for rail
