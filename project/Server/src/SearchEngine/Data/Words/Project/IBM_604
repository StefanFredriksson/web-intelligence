IBM 604 IBM 604 Electronic Calculator at NEMO national science museum in Amsterdam Note plugboard control panel used to program the 604 at bottom The IBM 604 was a control panel programmable Electronic Calculating Punch introduced in 1948 1 2 and was a machine on which considerable expectations for the future of the business were pinned and in which a corresponding amount of planning talent was invested 3 Most of the circuitry was based on modifications of circuit designs used in the earlier 603 Electronic Multiplier and was packaged in small one tube replaceable pluggable units which made the product more easily manufactured and serviced 4 The calculation unit contained 1250 tubes 5 Clock speed was increased from the 603s rate of 35k Hz to 50kHz The 604 performed fixed point addition subtraction multiplication and division using BCD arithmetic Initial versions supported 40 program steps and this was soon expanded to 60 Processing was still locked to the readerpunch cycle time thus program execution had to complete within the time between a punched card leaving the read station and entering the punch station The 604 and a modified version the 605 were used as components of the Card Programmed Electronic Calculators CPC and CPC II The 604 was also a component of the Test Assembly a precursor to IBMs early computers The circuit module design and packaging was also used for the IBM 650 a popular early computer An all transistor version of the 604 was built and demonstrated in October 1954 Although it used about 2000 transistors 6 as opposed to 1250 tubes in the original it occupied only half the volume and used only 5 as much power This was only an experimental machine but its technology was used to build the IBM 608 which shipped in December 1957 and was the first solidstate computing product to be commercialized 7 An IBM 604 is preserved at the American Computer Museum and another at the University of Amsterdam Computer Museum Contents 1 Photos 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Photos edit IBM 604 vacuum tube modules Single vacuum tube module Twotube modules See also edit List of IBM products List of vacuum tube computers References edit IBM Archive 1948 Research United States Office of Naval 1953 A survey of automatic digital computers Office of Naval Research Dept of the Navy p47 mwparseroutput citecitationfontstyleinheritmwparseroutput citation qquotesmwparseroutput citation cs1lockfree abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb665Lockgreensvg9pxLockgreensvgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput citation cs1locklimited amwparseroutput citation cs1lockregistration abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbdd6Lockgrayalt2svg9pxLockgrayalt2svgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput citation cs1locksubscription abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbaaaLockredalt2svg9pxLockredalt2svgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput cs1subscriptionmwparseroutput cs1registrationcolor555mwparseroutput cs1subscription spanmwparseroutput cs1registration spanborderbottom1px dottedcursorhelpmwparseroutput cs1wsicon abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb44cWikisourcelogosvg12pxWikisourcelogosvgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput codecs1codecolorinheritbackgroundinheritborderinheritpaddinginheritmwparseroutput cs1hiddenerrordisplaynonefontsize100mwparseroutput cs1visibleerrorfontsize100mwparseroutput cs1maintdisplaynonecolor33aa33marginleft03emmwparseroutput cs1subscriptionmwparseroutput cs1registrationmwparseroutput cs1formatfontsize95mwparseroutput cs1kernleftmwparseroutput cs1kernwlleftpaddingleft02emmwparseroutput cs1kernrightmwparseroutput cs1kernwlrightpaddingright02em Charles J Bashe Lyle R Johnson John H Palmer and Emerson W Pugh IBMs Early Computers MIT Press 1986 ISBN 0262022257 p 61 Pluggable Support for Electron Tube and Circuit US patent 2637763 filed July 9 1948 issued May 5 1953 Ralph L Palmer Weik Martin H March 1961 A Third Survey of Domestic Electronic Digital Computing Systems IBM 604 Section Ballistic Research Laboratories BRL Report No 1115 Contains about 4 pages of IBM 604 survey detail applications customers specifications and costs 195411pdf FORUM AllTransistor Computer Computers and Automation 3 9 2829 Nov 1954 CS1 maint others link Pugh Emerson W Johnson Lyle R Palmer John H 1991 IBMs 360 and Early 370 Systems MIT Press p34 ISBN 9780262161237 IBM 604 Electronic Calculating Punch notes manuals IBM 1954 IBM 604 Electronic Calculating Punch Manual of Operation IBM Form 22527910 PDF IBM 1958 IBM Customer Engineering Manual of Instruction 604 Electronic Calculating Punch IBM Form 22776090 PDF External links edit University of Amsterdam Computer Museum IBM 604 Columbia University ACIS History IBM 604
