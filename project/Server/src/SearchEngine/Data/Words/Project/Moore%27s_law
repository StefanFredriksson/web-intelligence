of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years The observation is named after Gordon Moore the cofounder of Fairchild Semiconductor and CEO of Intel whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit 2 and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade 3 In 1975 4 looking forward to the next decade 5 he revised the forecast to doubling every two years a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 40 6 7 8 The doubling period is often misquoted as 18 months because of a prediction by Moores colleague Intel executive David House In 1975 House noted that Moores revised law of doubling transistor count every 2 years in turn implied that computer chip performance would roughly double every 18 months with no increase in power consumption 9 Moores law is closely related to MOSFET scaling 10 as the rapid scaling and miniaturization of metaloxidesilicon fieldeffect transistors MOSFETs or MOS transistors 11 12 is the key driving force behind Moores law 10 13 Moores prediction proved accurate for several decades and has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide longterm planning and to set targets for research and development RD 14 Advancements in digital electronics are strongly linked to Moores law qualityadjusted microprocessor prices 15 memory capacity RAM and flash sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras 16 Digital electronics has contributed to world economic growth in the late twentieth and early twentyfirst centuries 17 Moores law describes a driving force of technological and social change productivity and economic growth 18 19 20 21 Moores law is an observation and projection of a historical trend It is an empirical relationship and not a physical or natural law Although the rate held steady from 1975 until around 2012 the rate was faster during the first decade In general it is not logically sound to extrapolate from the historical growth rate into the indefinite future For example the 2010 update to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors predicted that growth would slow around 2013 22 and in 2015 Gordon Moore foresaw that the rate of progress would reach saturation I see Moores law dying here in the next decade or so 23 Microprocessor architects report that semiconductor advancement has slowed industrywide since around 2010 below the pace predicted by Moores law 24 Brian Krzanich the former CEO of Intel announced Our cadence today is closer to two and a half years than two 25 Intel stated in 2015 that improvements in MOSFET devices have slowed starting at the 22nm feature width around 2012 and continuing at 14nm 26 Krzanich cited Moores 1975 revision as a precedent for the current deceleration which results from technical challenges and is a natural part of the history of Moores law 27 28 29 Leading semiconductor manufacturers TSMC and Samsung Electronics have the 10nm and 7nm FinFET nodes in mass production 30 31 and 5nm nodes in risk production 32 33 Contents 1 History of the concept 11 Moores second law 2 Major enabling factors 21 Recent trends 22 Alternative materials research 3 Forecasts and roadmaps 4 Consequences 5 Other formulations and similar observations 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References 9 Further reading 10 External links History of the concept edit Gordon Moore in 2004 In 1959 Douglas Engelbart discussed the projected downscaling of integrated circuit IC size in the article Microelectronics and the Art of Similitude 34 35 Engelbart presented his ideas at the 1960 International SolidState Circuits Conference where Moore was present in the audience 36 The MOSFET metaloxidesemiconductor fieldeffect transistor also known as the MOS transistor was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959 and demonstrated in 1960 37 It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and massproduced for a wide range of uses 38 due to its high scalability 11 and low power consumption leading to increasing transistor density 13 This made it possible to build highdensity IC chips 39 enabling what would later be known as Moores law 13 In the early 1960s Gordon E Moore recognized that the ideal electrical and scaling characteristics of MOSFET devices would lead to rapidly increasing integration levels and unparalleled growth in electronic applications 40 For the thirtyfifth anniversary issue of Electronics magazine which was published on April 19 1965 Gordon Moore who was working as the director of research and development at Fairchild Semiconductor at the time was asked to predict what was going to happen in the semiconductor components industry over the next ten years His response was a brief article entitled Cramming more components onto integrated circuits 41 Within his editorial he speculated that by 1975 it would be possible to contain as many as 65000 components on a single quartersquareinch semiconductor The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue if not to increase Over the longer term the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years His reasoning was a loglinear relationship between device complexity higher circuit density at reduced cost and time 42 43 In 1974 Robert H Dennard at IBM recognized the rapid MOSFET scaling technology and formulated what became known as Dennard scaling It states that as MOS transistors get smaller their power density stays constant so that the power use stays in proportion with area 44 45 MOSFET scaling and miniaturization has been the key driving force behind Moores law 10 According to experts in microprocessor design Dennard scaling ended in the 2000s so power density no longer scales inversely with areal density 24 At the 1975 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting Moore revised the forecast rate 6 46 Semiconductor complexity would continue to double annually until about 1980 after which it would decrease to a rate of doubling approximately every two years 46 He outlined several contributing factors for this exponential behavior 42 43 The advent of metaloxidesemiconductor MOS technology Die sizes were increasing at an exponential rate and as defective densities decreased chip manufacturers could work with larger areas without losing reduction yields Finer minimum dimensions What Moore called circuit and device cleverness Shortly after 1975 Caltech professor Carver Mead popularized the term Moores law 47 48 Despite a popular misconception Moore did not predict a doubling every 18 months Rather David House an Intel colleague had factored in the increasing performance of transistors to conclude that integrated circuits would double in performance every 18months 49 Mathematically Moores Law predicted that transistor count would double every 2 years due to shrinking transistor dimensions and other improvements As a consequence of shrinking dimensions Dennard scaling predicted that power consumption per unit area would remain constant Combining these effects David House deduced that computer chip performance would roughly double every 18 months Also due to Dennard scaling this increased performance would not be accompanied by increased power ie the energyefficiency of silicon based computer chips roughly doubles every 18 months Dennard scaling ended in the 2000s 24 Koomey later showed that a similar rate of efficiency improvement predated silicon chips and Moores Law for technologies such as vacuum tubes An Osborne Executive portable computer from 1982 with a Zilog Z80 4MHz CPU and a 2007 Apple iPhone with a 412MHz ARM11 CPU the Executive weighs 100 times as much is nearly 500 times the volume costs approximately 10 times as much adjusted for inflation and has 1103rd the clock frequency of the smartphone Moores law came to be widely accepted as a goal for the industry and it was cited by competitive semiconductor manufacturers as they strove to increase processing power Moore viewed his eponymous law as surprising and optimistic Moores law is a violation of Murphys law Everything gets better and better 50 The observation was even seen as a selffulfilling prophecy 14 51 However the rate of improvement in physical dimensions known as Dennard scaling MOSFET scaling has come to an end for most semiconductor manufacturers in recent years with much of the industry shifting circa 2016 from using semiconductor scaling as a driver to more of a focus on meeting the needs of major computing applications 14 52 24 In April 2005 Intel offered US10000 to purchase a copy of the original Electronics issue in which Moores article appeared 53 An engineer living in the United Kingdom was the first to find a copy and offer it to Intel 54 The 10 nm and 7 nm semiconductor nodes at Samsung and TSMC are claimed to keep pace with Moores law 30 31 55 56 57 58 Moores second law edit Further information Moores second law As the cost of computer power to the consumer falls the cost for producers to fulfill Moores law follows an opposite trend RD manufacturing and test costs have increased steadily with each new generation of chips Rising manufacturing costs are an important consideration for the sustaining of Moores law 59 This had led to the formulation of Moores second law also called Rocks law which is that the capital cost of a semiconductor fab also increases exponentially over time 60 61 Major enabling factors edit See also List of semiconductor scale examples and Transistor count The trend of MOSFET scaling for NAND flash memory allows the doubling of floatinggate MOSFET components manufactured in the same wafer area in less than 18 months Numerous innovations by scientists and engineers have sustained Moores law since the beginning of the integrated circuit IC era Some of the key innovations are listed below as examples of breakthroughs that have advanced integrated circuit and semiconductor device fabrication technology allowing transistor counts to grow by more than seven orders of magnitude in less than five decades Integrated circuit IC The raison dêtre for Moores law The germanium hybrid IC was invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958 62 followed by the invention of the silicon monolithic IC chip by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959 63 which was enabled by Jean Hoerni s planar process 1959 64 and Mohamed Atalla s silicon surface passivation process 1957 65 66 67 MOSFET metaloxidesemiconductor fieldeffect transistor Also known as the MOS transistor this is the key driving force behind Moores law 13 10 It was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959 37 It was the first transistor that could be miniaturised and massproduced for a wide range of uses 38 due to high scalability known as MOSFET scaling or Dennard scaling 11 making it possible to build highdensity IC chips 39 It is the most widely manufactured device in history with an estimated total of 13 sextillion MOS transistors manufactured as of 2018 68 69 CMOS complementary metaloxidesemiconductor The CMOS process a form of MOSFET fabrication was invented by ChihTang Sah and Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963 70 71 72 A number of advances in CMOS technology by researchers in the semiconductor field since then have enabled the extremely dense and highperformance ICs that the industry makes today Dynamic randomaccess memory DRAM Bipolar DRAM was developed by Toshiba in 1965 73 74 and then MOS DRAM was independently developed by Robert H Dennard at IBM in 1967 75 MOS DRAM made it possible to fabricate singletransistor memory cells on IC chips Microprocessor The first commercial singlechip microprocessor the Intel 4004 released in 1971 76 It was designed by Intel engineers Federico Faggin Marcian Hoff and Stan Mazor and Busicom engineer Masatoshi Shima 77 using Faggins MOS silicongate technology SGT 78 Flash memory Invented by Fujio Masuoka at Toshiba circa 1980 79 80 81 using floatinggate MOSFET FGMOS technology 82 83 This led to lowcost highcapacity memory in diverse electronic products NAND flash memory has since become the most rapidly scaling technology among electronic devices 3D integrated circuit 3D IC chip Research and development RD on 3D ICs was initiated in 1981 by the Research and Development Association for Future New Electron Devices in Japan 84 and the earliest 3D IC to be fabricated was a CMOS chip by a Fujitsu research team led by S Kawamura in 1983 85 Multigate MOSFET MuGET and 3D transistor A doublegate MOSFET was first demonstrated by Electrotechnical Laboratory researchers Toshihiro Sekigawa and Yutaka Hayashi in 1984 86 87 and a nonplanar doublegate 3D transistor by Digh Hisamotos Hitachi team in 1989 88 89 The FinFET fin fieldeffect transistor 3D transistor was developed by Hisamoto with a team of TSMC and UC Berkeley researchers who achieved 17nm fabrication in 1998 and 10nm fabrication in 2002 90 Chemicallyamplified photoresist Invented by Hiroshi Ito C Grant Willson and J M J Fréchet at IBM circa 1980 91 92 93 which was 510 times more sensitive to ultraviolet light 94 IBM introduced chemically amplified photoresist for DRAM production in the mid1980s 95 96 Deep UV excimer laser photolithography Invented by Kanti Jain 97 at IBM circa 1980 98 99 100 Prior to this excimer lasers had been mainly used as research devices since their development in the 1970s 101 102 From a broader scientific perspective the invention of excimer laser lithography has been highlighted as one of the major milestones in the 50year history of the laser 103 104 Interconnect innovations Interconnect innovations of the late 1990s including chemicalmechanical polishing or chemical mechanical planarization CMP trench isolation and copper interconnectsalthough not directly a factor in creating smaller transistorshave enabled improved wafer yield additional layers of metal wires closer spacing of devices and lower electrical resistance 105 106 107 Computer industry technology road maps predicted in 2001 that Moores law would continue for several generations of semiconductor chips 108 Recent trends edit An atomistic simulation for electron density as gate voltage Vg varies in a nanowire MOSFET The threshold voltage is around 045V Nanowire MOSFETs lie toward the end of the ITRS road map for scaling devices below 10nm gate lengths A FinFET has three sides of the channel covered by gate while some nanowire transistors have gateallaround GAA structure providing better gate control 108 One of the key challenges of engineering future nanoscale transistors is the design of gates As device dimension shrinks controlling the current flow in the thin channel becomes more difficult Compared to FinFETs which have gate dielectric on three sides of the channel gateallaround MOSFET GAAFET structure has even better gate control A gateallaround MOSFET was first demonstrated in 1988 by a Toshiba research team led by Fujio Masuoka who demonstrated a vertical nanowire GAAFET which he called a surrounding gate transistor SGT 109 110 Masuoka best known as the inventor of flash memory later left Toshiba and founded Unisantis Electronics in 2004 to research surroundinggate technology along with Tohoku University 111 In 2006 a team of Korean researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology KAIST and the National Nano Fab Center developed a 3nm transistor the worlds smallest nanoelectronic device based on FinFET technology 112 113 In 2010 researchers at the Tyndall National Institute in Cork Ireland announced a junctionless transistor A control gate wrapped around a silicon nanowire can control the passage of electrons without the use of junctions or doping They claim these may be produced at 10nanometer scale using existing fabrication techniques 114 In 2011 researchers at the University of Pittsburgh announced the development of a singleelectron transistor 15 nanometers in diameter made out of oxide based materials Three wires converge on a central island that can house one or two electrons Electrons tunnel from one wire to another through the island Conditions on the third wire result in distinct conductive properties including the ability of the transistor to act as a solid state memory 115 Nanowire transistors could spur the creation of microscopic computers 116 117 118 In 2012 a research team at the University of New South Wales announced the development of the first working transistor consisting of a single atom placed precisely in a silicon crystal not just picked from a large sample of random transistors 119 Moores law predicted this milestone to be reached for ICs in the lab by 2020 In 2015 IBM demonstrated 7 nm node chips with silicongermanium transistors produced using EUVL The company believes this transistor density would be four times that of current 14 nm chips 120 In 2020 Samsung Electronics plans to produce the 5nm node using FinFET and EUV technology 31 Samsung and TSMC plan to manufacture 3 nm GAAFET nodes by 20212022 121 122 Note that node names such as 3 nm have no relation to the physical size of device elements transistors A Toshiba research team including T Imoto M Matsui and C Takubo developed a System Block Module wafer bonding process for manufacturing 3D integrated circuit 3D IC packages in 2001 123 124 In April 2007 Toshiba introduced an eightlayer 3D IC the 16 GB THGAM embedded NAND flash memory chip which was manufactured with eight stacked 2 GB NAND flash chips 125 In September 2007 Hynix introduced 24layer 3D IC a 16 GB flash memory chip that was manufactured with 24 stacked NAND flash chips using a wafer bonding process 126 VNAND also known as 3D NAND allows flash memory cells to be stacked vertically using charge trap flash technology significantly increasing the number of transistors on a flash memory chip 3D NAND was first announced by Toshiba in 2007 127 VNAND was first commercially manufactured by Samsung Electronics in 2013 128 129 130 In 2008 researchers at HP Labs announced a working memristor a fourth basic passive circuit element whose existence only had been theorized previously The memristors unique properties permit the creation of smaller and betterperforming electronic devices 131 In 2014 bioengineers at Stanford University developed a circuit modeled on the human brain Sixteen Neurocore chips simulate one million neurons and billions of synaptic connections claimed to be 9000 times faster as well as more energy efficient than a typical PC 132 In 2015 Intel and Micron announced 3D XPoint a nonvolatile memory claimed to be significantly faster with similar density compared to NAND Production scheduled to begin in 2016 was delayed until the second half of 2017 133 134 135 In 2017 Samsung combined its VNAND technology with eUFS 3D IC stacking to produce a 512 GB flash memory chip with eight stacked 64layer VNAND dies 136 In 2019 Samsung produced a 1 TB flash chip with eight stacked 96layer VNAND dies along with quadlevel cell QLC technology 4bit per transistor 137 138 equivalent to 2 trillion transistors the highest transistor count of any IC chip The physical limits to transistor scaling have been reached due to sourcetodrain leakage limited gate metals and limited options for channel material Other approaches are being investigated which do not rely on physical scaling These include the spin state of electron spintronics tunnel junctions and advanced confinement of channel materials via nanowire geometry 139 Spinbased logic and memory options are being developed actively in labs 140 141 Alternative materials research edit The vast majority of current transistors on ICs are composed principally of doped silicon and its alloys As silicon is fabricated into single nanometer transistors shortchannel effects adversely change desired material properties of silicon as a functional transistor Below are several nonsilicon substitutes in the fabrication of small nanometer transistors One proposed material is indium gallium arsenide or InGaAs Compared to their silicon and germanium counterparts InGaAs transistors are more promising for future highspeed lowpower logic applications Because of intrinsic characteristics of IIIV compound semiconductors quantum well and tunnel effect transistors based on InGaAs have been proposed as alternatives to more traditional MOSFET designs In the early 2000s the atomic layer deposition highk film and pitch doublepatterning processes were invented by Gurtej Singh Sandhu at Micron Technology extending Moores law for planar CMOS technology to 30nm class and smaller 88 In 2009 Intel announced the development of 80nanometer InGaAs quantum well transistors Quantum well devices contain a material sandwiched between two layers of material with a wider band gap Despite being double the size of leading pure silicon transistors at the time the company reported that they performed equally as well while consuming less power 142 In 2011 researchers at Intel demonstrated 3D trigate InGaAs transistors with improved leakage characteristics compared to traditional planar designs The company claims that their design achieved the best electrostatics of any IIIV compound semiconductor transistor 143 At the 2015 International SolidState Circuits Conference Intel mentioned the use of IIIV compounds based on such an architecture for their 7 nanometer node 144 145 In 2011 researchers at the University of Texas at Austin developed an InGaAs tunneling fieldeffect transistors capable of higher operating currents than previous designs The first IIIV TFET designs were demonstrated in 2009 by a joint team from Cornell University and Pennsylvania State University 146 147 In 2012 a team in MITs Microsystems Technology Laboratories developed a 22nm transistor based on InGaAs which at the time was the smallest nonsilicon transistor ever built The team used techniques currently used in silicon device fabrication and aims for better electrical performance and a reduction to 10nanometer scale 148 Research is also showing how biological microcells are capable of impressive computational power clarification needed while being energy efficient 149 Scanning probe microscopy image of graphene in its hexagonal lattice structure Various forms of graphene are being studied for graphene electronics eg Graphene nanoribbon transistors have shown great promise since its appearance in publications in 2008 Bulk graphene has a band gap of zero and thus cannot be used in transistors because of its constant conductivity an inability to turn off The zigzag edges of the nanoribbons introduce localized energy states in the conduction and valence bands and thus a bandgap that enables switching when fabricated as a transistor As an example a typical GNR of width of 10nm has a desirable bandgap energy of 04eV 150 151 More research will need to be performed however on sub 50nm graphene layers as its resistivity value increases and thus electron mobility decreases 150 Forecasts and roadmaps edit Most forecasters including Gordon Moore 152 expect Moores law will end by around 2025 153 154 155 In April 2005 Gordon Moore stated in an interview that the projection cannot be sustained indefinitely It cant continue forever The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens He also noted that transistors eventually would reach the limits of miniaturization at atomic levels mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 In terms of size of transistors you can see that were approaching the size of atoms which is a fundamental barrier but itll be two or three generations before we get that farbut thats as far out as weve ever been able to see We have another 10 to 20 years before we reach a fundamental limit By then theyll be able to make bigger chips and have transistor budgets in the billions 156 In 2016 the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors after using Moores Law to drive the industry since 1998 produced its final roadmap It no longer centered its research and development plan on Moores law Instead it outlined what might be called the More than Moore strategy in which the needs of applications drive chip development rather than a focus on semiconductor scaling Application drivers range from smartphones to AI to data centers 154 IEEE began a roadmapping initiative in 2016 Rebooting Computing named the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems IRDS 157 Consequences edit Technological change is a combination of more and of better technology A 2011 study in the journal Science showed that the peak of the rate of change of the worlds capacity to compute information was in 1998 when the worlds technological capacity to compute information on generalpurpose computers grew at 88 per year 158 Since then technological change clearly has slowed In recent times every new year allowed humans to carry out roughly 60 more computation than possibly could have been executed by all existing generalpurpose computers in the year before 158 This still is exponential but shows that the rate of technological change varies over time 159 The primary driving force of economic growth is the growth of productivity 20 and Moores law factors into productivity Moore 1995 expected that the rate of technological progress is going to be controlled from financial realities 160 The reverse could and did occur around the late1990s however with economists reporting that Productivity growth is the key economic indicator of innovation 21 An acceleration in the rate of semiconductor progress contributed to a surge in US productivity growth 161 162 163 which reached 34 per year in 19972004 outpacing the 16 per year during both 19721996 and 20052013 164 As economist Richard G Anderson notes Numerous studies have traced the cause of the productivity acceleration to technological innovations in the production of semiconductors that sharply reduced the prices of such components and of the products that contain them as well as expanding the capabilities of such products 165 Intel transistor gate length trend transistor scaling has slowed down significantly at advanced smaller nodes An alternative source of improved performance is in microarchitecture techniques exploiting the growth of available transistor count Outoforder execution and onchip caching and prefetching reduce the memory latency bottleneck at the expense of using more transistors and increasing the processor complexity These increases are described empirically by Pollacks Rule which states that performance increases due to microarchitecture techniques approximate the square root of the complexity number of transistors or the area of a processor For years processor makers delivered increases in clock rates and instructionlevel parallelism so that singlethreaded code executed faster on newer processors with no modification 166 Now to manage CPU power dissipation processor makers favor multicore chip designs and software has to be written in a multithreaded manner to take full advantage of the hardware Many multithreaded development paradigms introduce overhead and will not see a linear increase in speed vs number of processors This is particularly true while accessing shared or dependent resources due to lock contention This effect becomes more noticeable as the number of processors increases There are cases where a roughly 45 increase in processor transistors has translated to roughly 1020 increase in processing power 167 On the other hand manufacturers are adding specialized processing units to deal with features such as graphics video and cryptography For one example Intels Parallel JavaScript extension not only adds support for multiple cores but also for the other nongeneral processing features of their chips as part of the migration in client side scripting toward HTML5 168 A negative implication of Moores law is obsolescence that is as technologies continue to rapidly improve these improvements may be significant enough to render predecessor technologies obsolete rapidly In situations in which security and survivability of hardware or data are paramount or in which resources are limited rapid obsolescence may pose obstacles to smooth or continued operations 169 Because of the toxic materials used in the production of modern computers obsolescence if not properly managed may lead to harmful environmental impacts On the other hand obsolescence may sometimes be desirable to a company which can profit immensely from the regular purchase of what is often expensive new equipment instead of retaining one device for a longer period of time Those in the industry are well aware of this and may utilize planned obsolescence as a method of increasing profits 170 Moores law has affected the performance of other technologies significantly Michael S Malone wrote of a Moores War following the apparent success of shock and awe in the early days of the Iraq War Progress in the development of guided weapons depends on electronic technology 171 Improvements in circuit density and lowpower operation associated with Moores law also have contributed to the development of technologies including mobile telephones 172 and 3D printing 173 Other formulations and similar observations edit Several measures of digital technology are improving at exponential rates related to Moores law including the size cost density and speed of components Moore wrote only about the density of components a component being a transistor resistor diode or capacitor 160 at minimum cost Transistors per integrated circuit The most popular formulation is of the doubling of the number of transistors on integrated circuits every two years At the end of the 1970s Moores law became known as the limit for the number of transistors on the most complex chips The graph at the top shows this trend holds true today As of 2017 the commercially available processor possessing the highest number of transistors is the 48 core Centriq with over 18 billion transistors 174 Density at minimum cost per transistor This is the formulation given in Moores 1965 paper 3 It is not just about the density of transistors that can be achieved but about the density of transistors at which the cost per transistor is the lowest 175 As more transistors are put on a chip the cost to make each transistor decreases but the chance that the chip will not work due to a defect increases In 1965 Moore examined the density of transistors at which cost is minimized and observed that as transistors were made smaller through advances in photolithography this number would increase at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year 3 Dennard scaling MOSFET scaling This posits that power usage would decrease in proportion to area both voltage and current being proportional to length of transistors Combined with Moores law performance per watt would grow at roughly the same rate as transistor density doubling every 12 years According to Dennard scaling transistor dimensions would be scaled by 30 07x every technology generation thus reducing their area by 50 This would reduce the delay by 30 07x and therefore increase operating frequency by about 40 14x Finally to keep electric field constant voltage would be reduced by 30 reducing energy by 65 and power at 14x frequency by 50 note 1 Therefore in every technology generation transistor density would double circuit becomes 40 faster while power consumption with twice the number of transistors stays the same 176 Dennnard scaling came to end in 20052010 due to leakage currents 24 The exponential processor transistor growth predicted by Moore does not always translate into exponentially greater practical CPU performance Since around 20052007 Dennard scaling has ended so even though Moores law continued for several years after that it has not yielded dividends in improved performance 44 177 The primary reason cited for the breakdown is that at small sizes current leakage poses greater challenges and also causes the chip to heat up which creates a threat of thermal runaway and therefore further increases energy costs 44 177 24 The breakdown of Dennard scaling prompted a greater focus on multicore processors but the gains offered by switching to more cores are lower than the gains that would be achieved had Dennard scaling continued 178 179 In another departure from Dennard scaling Intel microprocessors adopted a nonplanar trigate FinFET at 22 nm in 2012 that is faster and consumes less power than a conventional planar transistor 180 The rate of performance improvement for singlecore microprocessors has slowed significantly 181 Singlecore performance was improving by 52 per year in 19862003 and 23 per year in 20032011 but slowed to just seven percent per year in 20112018 181 Quality adjusted price of IT equipment The price of information technology IT computers and peripheral equipment adjusted for quality and inflation declined 16 per year on average over the five decades from 1959 to 2009 182 183 The pace accelerated however to 23 per year in 19951999 triggered by faster IT innovation 21 and later slowed to 2 per year in 20102013 182 184 The rate of qualityadjusted microprocessor price improvement likewise varies and is not linear on a log scale Microprocessor price improvement accelerated during the late 1990s reaching 60 per year halving every nine months versus the typical 30 improvement rate halving every two years during the years earlier and later 185 186 Laptop microprocessors in particular improved 2535 per year in 20042010 and slowed to 1525 per year in 20102013 187 The number of transistors per chip cannot explain qualityadjusted microprocessor prices fully 185 188 189 Moores 1995 paper does not limit Moores law to strict linearity or to transistor count The definition of Moores Law has come to refer to almost anything related to the semiconductor industry that on a semilog plot approximates a straight line I hesitate to review its origins and by doing so restrict its definition 160 Hard disk drive areal density A similar prediction sometimes called Kryders law was made in 2005 for hard disk drive areal density 190 The prediction was later viewed as overoptimistic Several decades of rapid progress in areal density slowed around 2010 from 30100 per year to 1015 per year because of noise related to smaller grain size of the disk media thermal stability and writability using available magnetic fields 191 192 Fiberoptic capacity The number of bits per second that can be sent down an optical fiber increases exponentially faster than Moores law Kecks law in honor of Donald Keck 193 Network capacity According to GerryGerald Butters 194 195 the former head of Lucents Optical Networking Group at Bell Labs there is another version called Butters Law of Photonics 196 a formulation that deliberately parallels Moores law Butters law says that the amount of data coming out of an optical fiber is doubling every nine months 197 Thus the cost of transmitting a bit over an optical network decreases by half every nine months The availability of wavelengthdivision multiplexing sometimes called WDM increased the capacity that could be placed on a single fiber by as much as a factor of 100 Optical networking and dense wavelengthdivision multiplexing DWDM is rapidly bringing down the cost of networking and further progress seems assured As a result the wholesale price of data traffic collapsed in the dotcom bubble Nielsens Law says that the bandwidth available to users increases by 50 annually 198 Pixels per dollar Similarly Barry Hendy of Kodak Australia has plotted pixels per dollar as a basic measure of value for a digital camera demonstrating the historical linearity on a log scale of this market and the opportunity to predict the future trend of digital camera price LCD and LED screens and resolution 199 200 201 The great Moores law compensator TGMLC also known as Wirths law generally is referred to as software bloat and is the principle that successive generations of computer software increase in size and complexity thereby offsetting the performance gains predicted by Moores law In a 2008 article in InfoWorld Randall C Kennedy 202 formerly of Intel introduces this term using successive versions of Microsoft Office between the year 2000 and 2007 as his premise Despite the gains in computational performance during this time period according to Moores law Office 2007 performed the same task at half the speed on a prototypical year 2007 computer as compared to Office 2000 on a year 2000 computer Library expansion was calculated in 1945 by Fremont Rider to double in capacity every 16 years if sufficient space were made available 203 He advocated replacing bulky decaying printed works with miniaturized microform analog photographs which could be duplicated ondemand for library patrons or other institutions He did not foresee the digital technology that would follow decades later to replace analog microform with digital imaging storage and transmission media Automated potentially lossless digital technologies allowed vast increases in the rapidity of information growth in an era that now sometimes is called the Information Age Carlson curve is a term coined by The Economist 204 to describe the biotechnological equivalent of Moores law and is named after author Rob Carlson 205 Carlson accurately predicted that the doubling time of DNA sequencing technologies measured by cost and performance would be at least as fast as Moores law 206 Carlson Curves illustrate the rapid in some cases hyperexponential decreases in cost and increases in performance of a variety of technologies including DNA sequencing DNA synthesis and a range of physical and computational tools used in protein expression and in determining protein structures Erooms law is a pharmaceutical drug development observation which was deliberately written as Moores Law spelled backwards in order to contrast it with the exponential advancements of other forms of technology such as transistors over time It states that the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubles every nine years Experience curve effects says that each doubling of the cumulative production of virtually any product or service is accompanied by an approximate constant percentage reduction in the unit cost The acknowledged first documented qualitative description of this dates from 1885 207 208 A power curve was used to describe this phenomenon in a 1936 discussion of the cost of airplanes 209 Edholms law Phil Edholm observed that the bandwidth of telecommunication networks including the Internet is doubling every 18 months 210 The bandwidths of online communication networks has risen from bits per second to terabits per second The rapid rise in online bandwidth is largely due to the same MOSFET scaling that enables Moores law as telecommunications networks are built from MOSFETs 211 See also edit Accelerating change Beyond CMOS Ephemeralization Koomeys law List of eponymous
