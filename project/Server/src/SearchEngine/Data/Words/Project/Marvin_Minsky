edit Marvin Lee Minsky was born in New York City to an eye surgeon father Henry and to a mother Fannie Reiser who was a Zionist activist 15 16 17 His family was Jewish He attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School and the Bronx High School of Science He later attended Phillips Academy in Andover Massachusetts He then served in the US Navy from 1944 to 1945 He received a BA in mathematics from Harvard University 1950 and a PhD in mathematics from Princeton University 1954 18 19 He was a Junior Fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows from 19541957 20 He was on the MIT faculty from 1958 to his death He joined the staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 1958 and a year later he and John McCarthy initiated what is as of 2019 update named the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory 21 22 He was the Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences and professor of electrical engineering and computer science Contributions in computer science edit 3D profile of a coin partial measured with a modern confocal white light microscope Minskys inventions include the first headmounted graphical display 1963 23 and the confocal microscope 2 note 1 1957 a predecessor to todays widely used confocal laser scanning microscope He developed with Seymour Papert the first Logo turtle Minsky also built in 1951 the first randomly wired neural network learning machine SNARC In 1962 Minsky published a 74 Turing machine that he was able to prove to be universal At the time it was the simplest known universal Turing machine a record that stood for about 40 years until Stephen Wolfram published a 25 universal Turing machine in his 2002 book A New Kind of Science 24 Minsky wrote the book Perceptrons with Seymour Papert attacking the work of Frank Rosenblatt which became the foundational work in the analysis of artificial neural networks This book is the center of a controversy in the history of AI as some claim it to have had great importance in discouraging research of neural networks in the 1970s and contributing to the socalled AI winter 25 He also founded several other AI models His book A framework for representing knowledge created a new paradigm in programming While his Perceptrons is now more a historical than practical book the theory of frames is in wide use 26 Minsky also wrote of the possibility that extraterrestrial life may think like humans permitting communication 27 In the early 1970s at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Minsky and Papert started developing what came to be known as the Society of Mind theory The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of nonintelligent parts Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm a video camera and a computer to build with childrens blocks In 1986 Minsky published The Society of Mind a comprehensive book on the theory which unlike most of his previously published work was written for the general public In November 2006 Minsky published The Emotion Machine a book that critiques many popular theories of how human minds work and suggests alternative theories often replacing simple ideas with more complex ones Recent drafts of the book are freely available from his webpage 28 Role in popular culture edit Minsky was an adviser 29 on Stanley Kubrick s movie 2001 A Space Odyssey one of the movies characters Victor Kaminski was named in Minskys honor 30 Minsky is mentioned explicitly in Arthur C Clarke s derivative novel of the same name where he is portrayed as achieving a crucial breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the thenfuture 1980s paving the way for HAL 9000 in the early 21st century mwparseroutput

artificial neural networks could be generated automaticallyself replicatedin accordance with any arbitrary learning program Artificial brains could be grown by a process strikingly analogous to the development of a human brain In any given case the precise details would never be known and even if they were they would be millions of times too complex for human understanding 31 Personal life edit The Minskytron or Three Position Display running on the Computer History Museum s PDP1 2007 In 1952 Minsky married pediatrician Gloria Rudisch together they had three children 32 Minsky was a talented improvisational pianist 33 who published musings on the relations between music and psychology Opinions edit Minsky was an atheist 34 a signatory to the Scientists Open Letter on Cryonics 35 He was a critic of the Loebner Prize for conversational robots 36 and argued that a fundamental difference between humans and machines was that while humans are machines they are machines in which intelligence emerges from the interplay of the many unintelligent but semiautonomous agents that comprise the brain 37 He argued that somewhere down the line some computers will become more intelligent than most people but that it was very hard to predict how fast progress would be 38 He cautioned that an artificial superintelligence designed to solve an innocuous mathematical problem might decide to assume control of Earths resources to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal 39 but believed that such negative scenarios are hard to take seriously because he felt confident that AI would go through a lot of testing before being deployed 40 Death edit In January 2016 Minsky died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 88 41 Minsky was a member of Alcor Life Extension Foundation s Scientific Advisory Board 42 Controversies edit Minsky an alumni of Harvard University was one of a number of prominent scientists who received research funding from Jeffrey Epstein Many of those scientists were affiliated with Harvard including physicist Lawrence Krauss geneticist George Church and cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker 43 In 2002 four years before Epsteins first arrest for a sex offense Minsky received a research grant from him it was the first from Epstein to MIT 44 45 46 47 In 2016 Virginia Giuffre named Minsky as one of the men she was directed to have sex with on Epsteins private island 48 43 49 As of September 2019 update there is no independent corroboration of this and there have been no civil or criminal claims made against any of the men 50 51 Minskys widow Gloria Rudisch denied that he had sex with any of the women at Epsteins residences and explained that she went with him on all trips as a couple and that they were always together 48 Bibliography selected edit 1967

Medal from the Franklin Institute for 2001 52 In 2006 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for cofounding the field of artificial intelligence creating early neural networks and robots and developing theories of human and machine cognition 53 In 2011 Minsky was inducted into IEEE Intelligent Systems AI Hall of Fame for the significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems 54 55 In 2014 Minsky won the Dan David Prize for Artificial Intelligence the Digital Mind 56 He was also awarded with the 2013 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Information and Communication Technologies category 57 Minsky was affiliated with the following organizations United States National Academy of Engineering 23 United States National Academy of
