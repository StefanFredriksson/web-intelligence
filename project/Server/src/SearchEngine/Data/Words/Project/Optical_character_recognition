Optical character recognition Computer recognition of visual text Play media Video of the process of scanning and realtime optical character recognition OCR with a portable scanner Optical character recognition or optical character reader OCR is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed handwritten or printed text into machineencoded text whether from a scanned document a photo of a document a scenephoto for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image for example from a television broadcast 1 Widely used as a form of data entry from printed paper data records whether passport documents invoices bank statements computerized receipts business cards mail printouts of staticdata or any suitable documentation it is a common method of digitizing printed texts so that they can be electronically edited searched stored more compactly displayed online and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing machine translation extracted texttospeech key data and text mining OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition artificial intelligence and computer vision Early versions needed to be trained with images of each character and worked on one font at a time Advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of recognition accuracy for most fonts are now common and with support for a variety of digital image file format inputs 2 Some systems are capable of reproducing formatted output that closely approximates the original page including images columns and other nontextual components

character recognition may be traced to technologies involving telegraphy and creating reading devices for the blind 3 In 1914 Emanuel Goldberg developed a machine that read characters and converted them into standard telegraph code 4 Concurrently Edmund Fournier dAlbe developed the Optophone a handheld scanner that when moved across a printed page produced tones that corresponded to specific letters or characters 5 In the late 1920s and into the 1930s Emanuel Goldberg developed what he called a Statistical Machine for searching microfilm archives using an optical code recognition system In 1931 he was granted USA Patent number 1838389 for the invention The patent was acquired by IBM Blind and visually impaired users edit In 1974 Ray Kurzweil started the company Kurzweil Computer Products Inc and continued development of omni font OCR which could recognize text printed in virtually any font Kurzweil is often credited with inventing omnifont OCR but it was in use by companies including CompuScan in the late 1960s and 1970s 3 6 Kurzweil decided that the best application of this technology would be to create a reading machine for the blind which would allow blind people to have a computer read text to them out loud This device required the invention of two enabling technologies the CCD flatbed scanner and the texttospeech synthesizer On January 13 1976 the successful finished product was unveiled during a widely reported news conference headed by Kurzweil and the leaders of the National Federation of the Blind citation needed In 1978 Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program LexisNexis was one of the first customers and bought the program to upload legal paper and news documents onto its nascent online databases Two years later Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox which had an interest in further commercializing papertocomputer text conversion Xerox eventually spun it off as Scansoft which merged with Nuance Communications In the 2000s OCR was made available online as a service WebOCR in a cloud computing environment and in mobile applications like realtime translation of foreignlanguage signs on a smartphone With the advent of smartphones and smartglasses OCR can be used in internet connected mobile device applications that extract text captured using the devices camera These devices that do not have OCR functionality built into the operating system will typically use an OCR API to extract the text from the image file captured and provided by the device 7 8 The OCR API returns the extracted text along with information about the location of the detected text in the original image back to the device app for further processing such as texttospeech or display Various commercial and open source OCR systems are available for most common writing systems including Latin Cyrillic Arabic Hebrew Indic Bengali Bangla Devanagari Tamil Chinese Japanese and Korean characters Applications edit OCR engines have been developed into many kinds of domainspecific OCR applications such as receipt OCR invoice OCR check OCR legal billing document OCR They can be used for Data entry for business documents eg check passport invoice bank statement and receipt Automatic number plate recognition In airports for passport recognition and information extraction Automatic insurance documents key information extraction Extracting business card information into a contact list 9 More quickly make textual versions of printed documents eg book scanning for Project Gutenberg Make electronic images of printed documents searchable eg Google Books Converting handwriting in real time to control a computer pen computing Defeating CAPTCHA antibot systems though these are specifically designed to prevent OCR 10 11 12 The purpose can also be to test the robustness of CAPTCHA antibot systems Assistive technology for blind and visually impaired users Types edit Optical character recognition OCR targets typewritten text one glyph or character at a time Optical word recognition targets typewritten text one word at a time for languages that use a space as a word divider Usually just called OCR Intelligent character recognition ICR also targets handwritten printscript or cursive text one glyph or character at a time usually involving machine learning Intelligent word recognition IWR also targets handwritten printscript or cursive text one word at a time This is especially useful for languages where glyphs are not separated in cursive script OCR is generally an offline process which analyses a static document Handwriting movement analysis can be used as input to handwriting recognition 13 Instead of merely using the shapes of glyphs and words this technique is able to capture motions such as the order in which segments are drawn the direction and the pattern of putting the pen down and lifting it This additional information can make the endtoend process more accurate This technology is also known as online character recognition dynamic character recognition realtime character recognition and intelligent character recognition Techniques edit Preprocessing edit OCR software often preprocesses images to improve the chances of successful recognition Techniques include 14 De skew If the document was not aligned properly when scanned it may need to be tilted a few degrees clockwise or counterclockwise in order to make lines of text perfectly horizontal or vertical Despeckle remove positive and negative spots smoothing edges Binarisation Convert an image from color or greyscale to blackandwhite called a binary image because there are two colors The task of binarisation is performed as a simple way of separating the text or any other desired image component from the background 15 The task of binarisation itself is necessary since most commercial recognition algorithms work only on binary images since it proves to be simpler to do so 16 In addition the effectiveness of the binarisation step influences to a significant extent the quality of the character recognition stage and the careful decisions are made in the choice of the binarisation employed for a given input image type since the quality of the binarisation method employed to obtain the binary result depends on the type of the input image scanned document scene text image historical degraded document etc 17 18 Line removal Cleans up nonglyph boxes and lines Layout analysis or zoning Identifies columns paragraphs captions etc as distinct blocks Especially important in multicolumn layouts and tables Line and word detection Establishes baseline for word and character shapes separates words if necessary Script recognition In multilingual documents the script may change at the level of the words and hence identification of the script is necessary before the right OCR can be invoked to handle the specific script 19 Character isolation or segmentation For percharacter OCR multiple characters that are connected due to image artifacts must be separated single characters that are broken into multiple pieces due to artifacts must be connected Normalize aspect ratio and scale 20 Segmentation of fixedpitch fonts is accomplished relatively simply by aligning the image to a uniform grid based on where vertical grid lines will least often intersect black areas For proportional fonts more sophisticated techniques are needed because whitespace between letters can sometimes be greater than that between words and vertical lines can intersect more than one character 21 Character recognition edit There are two basic types of core OCR algorithm which may produce a ranked list of candidate characters 22 Matrix matching involves comparing an image to a stored glyph on a pixelbypixel basis it is also known as pattern matching pattern recognition or image correlation This relies on the input glyph being correctly isolated from the rest of the image and on the stored glyph being in a similar font and at the same scale This technique works best with typewritten text and does not work well when new fonts are encountered This is the technique the early physical photocellbased OCR implemented rather directly Feature extraction decomposes glyphs into features like lines closed loops line direction and line intersections The extraction features reduces the dimensionality of the representation and makes the recognition process computationally efficient These features are compared with an abstract vectorlike representation of a character which might reduce to one or more glyph prototypes General techniques of feature detection in computer vision are applicable to this type of OCR which is commonly seen in intelligent handwriting recognition and indeed most modern OCR software 23 Nearest neighbour classifiers such as the knearest neighbors algorithm are used to compare image features with stored glyph features and choose the nearest match 24 Software such as Cuneiform and Tesseract use a twopass approach to character recognition The second pass is known as adaptive recognition and uses the letter shapes recognized with high confidence on the first pass to recognize better the remaining letters on the second pass This is advantageous for unusual fonts or lowquality scans where the font is distorted eg blurred or faded 21 The OCR result can be stored in the standardized ALTO format a dedicated XML schema maintained by the United States Library of Congress For a list of optical character recognition software see Comparison of optical character recognition software Postprocessing edit OCR accuracy can be increased if the output is constrained by a lexicon a list of words that are allowed to occur in a document 14 This might be for example all the words in the English language or a more technical lexicon for a specific field This technique can be problematic if the document contains words not in the lexicon like proper nouns Tesseract uses its dictionary to influence the character segmentation step for improved accuracy 21 The output stream may be a plain text stream or file of characters but more sophisticated OCR systems can preserve the original layout of the page and produce for example an annotated PDF that includes both the original image of the page and a searchable textual representation Nearneighbor analysis can make use of cooccurrence frequencies to correct errors by noting that certain words are often seen together 25 For example Washington DC is generally far more common in English than Washington DOC Knowledge of the grammar of the language being scanned can also help determine if a word is likely to be a verb or a noun for example allowing greater accuracy The Levenshtein Distance algorithm has also been used in OCR postprocessing to further optimize results from an OCR API 26 Applicationspecific optimizations edit In recent years when the major OCR technology providers began to tweak OCR systems to deal more efficiently with specific types of input Beyond an applicationspecific lexicon better performance may be had by taking into account business rules standard expression clarification needed or rich information contained in color images This strategy is called ApplicationOriented OCR or Customized OCR and has been applied to OCR of license plates invoices screenshots ID cards driver licenses and automobile manufacturing The New York Times has adapted the OCR technology into a proprietary tool they entitle Document Helper that enables their interactive news team to accelerate the processing of documents that need to be reviewed They note that it enables them to process what amounts to as many as 5400 pages per hour in preparation for reporters to review the contents 27 Workarounds edit There are several techniques for solving the problem of character recognition by means other than improved OCR algorithms Forcing better input edit Special fonts like OCRA OCRB or MICR fonts with precisely specified sizing spacing and distinctive character shapes allow a higher accuracy rate during transcription in bank check processing Ironically however several prominent OCR engines were designed to capture text in popular fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman and are incapable of capturing text in these fonts that are specialized and much different from popularly used fonts As Google Tesseract can be trained to recognize new fonts it can recognize OCRA OCRB and MICR fonts 28 Comb fields are preprinted boxes that encourage humans to write more legibly one glyph per box 25 These are often printed in a dropout color which can be easily removed by the OCR system 25 Palm OS used a special set of glyphs known as Graffiti which are similar to printed English characters but simplified or modified for easier recognition on the platforms computationally limited hardware Users would need to learn how to write these special glyphs Zonebased OCR restricts the image to a specific part of a document This is often referred to as Template OCR Crowdsourcing edit Crowdsourcing humans to perform the character recognition can quickly process images like computerdriven OCR but with higher accuracy for recognizing images than is obtained with computers Practical systems include the Amazon Mechanical Turk and reCAPTCHA The National Library of Finland has developed an online interface for users to correct OCRed texts in the standardized ALTO format 29 Crowd sourcing has also been used not to perform character recognition directly but to invite software developers to develop image processing algorithms for example through the use of rankorder tournaments 30 Accuracy edit This article needs to be updated Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information March 2013 Commissioned by the US Department of Energy DOE the Information Science Research Institute ISRI had the mission to foster the improvement of automated technologies for understanding machine printed documents and it conducted the most authoritative of the Annual Test of OCR Accuracy from 1992 to 1996 31 Recognition of Latinscript typewritten text is still not 100 accurate even where clear imaging is available One study based on recognition of 19th and early 20thcentury newspaper pages concluded that characterbycharacter OCR accuracy for commercial OCR software varied from 81 to 99 32 total accuracy can be achieved by human review or Data Dictionary Authentication Other areasincluding recognition of hand printing cursive handwriting and printed text in other scripts especially those East Asian language characters which have many strokes for a single characterare still the subject of active research The MNIST database is commonly used for testing systems ability to recognise handwritten digits Accuracy rates can be measured in several ways and how they are measured can greatly affect the reported accuracy rate For example if word context basically a lexicon of words is not used to correct software finding nonexistent words a character error rate of 1 99 accuracy may result in an error rate of 5 95 accuracy or worse if the measurement is based on whether each whole word was recognized with no incorrect letters 33 An example of the difficulties inherent in digitizing old text is the inability of OCR to differentiate between the long s and f characters 34 Webbased OCR systems for recognizing handprinted text on the fly have become well known as commercial products in recent years when see Tablet PC history Accuracy rates of 80 to 90 on neat clean handprinted characters can be achieved by pen computing software but that accuracy rate still translates to dozens of errors per page making the technology useful only in very limited applications citation needed Recognition of cursive text is an active area of research with recognition rates even lower than that of handprinted text Higher rates of recognition of general cursive script will likely not be possible without the use of contextual or grammatical information For example recognizing entire words from a dictionary is easier than trying to parse individual characters from script Reading the Amount line of a cheque which is always a writtenout number is an example where using a smaller dictionary can increase recognition rates greatly The shapes of individual cursive characters themselves simply do not contain enough information to accurately greater than 98 recognize all handwritten cursive script citation needed Most programs allow users to set confidence rates This means that if the software does not achieve their desired level of accuracy a user can be notified for manual review Unicode edit Main article Optical Character Recognition Unicode block Characters to support OCR were added to the Unicode Standard in June 1993 with the release of
