Cryptanalysis Several terms redirect here For other uses see Codebreaker disambiguation Closeup of the rotors in a Fialka cipher machine Cryptanalysis from the Greek kryptós hidden and analýein to loosen or to untie is the study of analyzing information systems in order to study the hidden aspects of the systems 1 Cryptanalysis is used to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages even if the cryptographic key is unknown In addition to mathematical analysis of cryptographic algorithms cryptanalysis includes the study of sidechannel attacks that do not target weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms themselves but instead exploit weaknesses in their implementation Even though the goal has been the same the methods and techniques of cryptanalysis have changed drastically through the history of cryptography adapting to increasing cryptographic complexity ranging from the penandpaper methods of the past through machines like the British Bombes and Colossus computers at Bletchley Park in World War II to the mathematically advanced computerized schemes of the present Methods for breaking modern cryptosystems often involve solving carefully constructed problems in pure mathematics the bestknown being integer factorization Contents 1 Overview 11 Amount of information available to the attacker 12 Computational resources

Further reading 11 External links Overview edit Given some encrypted data ciphertext the goal of the cryptanalyst is to gain as much information as possible about the original unencrypted data plaintext It is useful to consider two aspects of achieving this The first is breaking the system that is discovering how the encipherment process works The second is solving the key that is unique for a particular encrypted message or group of messages citation needed Amount of information available to the attacker edit Attacks can be classified based on what type of information the attacker has available As a basic starting point it is normally assumed that for the purposes of analysis the general algorithm is known this is Shannons Maxim the enemy knows the system 2 in its turn equivalent to Kerckhoffs principle 3 This is a reasonable assumption in practice throughout history there are countless examples of secret algorithms falling into wider knowledge variously through espionage betrayal and reverse engineering And on occasion ciphers have been broken through pure deduction for example the German Lorenz cipher and the Japanese Purple code and a variety of classical schemes 4 Ciphertextonly the cryptanalyst has access only to a collection of ciphertexts or codetexts Knownplaintext the attacker has a set of ciphertexts to which he knows the corresponding plaintext Chosenplaintext chosenciphertext the attacker can obtain the ciphertexts plaintexts corresponding to an arbitrary set of plaintexts ciphertexts of his own choosing Adaptive chosenplaintext like a chosenplaintext attack except the attacker can choose subsequent plaintexts based on information learned from previous encryptions Similarly Adaptive chosen ciphertext attack Relatedkey attack Like a chosenplaintext attack except the attacker can obtain ciphertexts encrypted under two different keys The keys are unknown but the relationship between them is known for example two keys that differ in the one bit Computational resources required edit Attacks can also be characterised by the resources they require Those resources include 5 Time the number of computation steps eg test encryptions which must be performed Memory the amount of storage required to perform the attack Data the quantity and type of plaintexts and ciphertexts required for a particular approach Its sometimes difficult to predict these quantities precisely especially when the attack isnt practical to actually implement for testing But academic cryptanalysts tend to provide at least the estimated order of magnitude of their attacks difficulty saying for example SHA1 collisions now 2 52 6 Bruce Schneier notes that even computationally impractical attacks can be considered breaks Breaking a cipher simply means finding a weakness in the cipher that can be exploited with a complexity less than brute force Never mind that bruteforce might require 2 128 encryptions an attack requiring 2 110 encryptions would be considered a breaksimply put a break can just be a certificational weakness evidence that the cipher does not perform as advertised 7 Partial breaks edit The results of cryptanalysis can also vary in usefulness For example cryptographer Lars Knudsen 1998 classified various types of attack on block ciphers according to the amount and quality of secret information that was discovered Total break the attacker deduces the secret key Global deduction the attacker discovers a functionally equivalent algorithm for encryption and decryption but without learning the key Instance local deduction the attacker discovers additional plaintexts or ciphertexts not previously known Information deduction the attacker gains some Shannon information about plaintexts or ciphertexts not previously known Distinguishing algorithm the attacker can distinguish the cipher from a random permutation Academic attacks are often against weakened versions of a cryptosystem such as a block cipher or hash function with some rounds removed Many but not all attacks become exponentially more difficult to execute as rounds are added to a cryptosystem 8 so its possible for the full cryptosystem to be strong even though reducedround variants are weak Nonetheless partial breaks that come close to breaking the original cryptosystem may mean that a full break will follow the successful attacks on DES MD5 and SHA1 were all preceded by attacks on weakened versions In academic cryptography a weakness or a break in a scheme is usually defined quite conservatively it might require impractical amounts of time memory or known plaintexts It also might require the attacker be able to do things many realworld attackers cant for example the attacker may need to choose particular plaintexts to be encrypted or even to ask for plaintexts to be encrypted using several keys related to the secret key Furthermore it might only reveal a small amount of information enough to prove the cryptosystem imperfect but too little to be useful to realworld attackers Finally an attack might only apply to a weakened version of cryptographic tools like a reducedround block cipher as a step towards breaking of the full system 7 History edit Main article History of cryptography Cryptanalysis has coevolved together with cryptography and the contest can be traced through the history of cryptography new ciphers being designed to replace old broken designs and new cryptanalytic techniques invented to crack the improved schemes In practice they are viewed as two sides of the same coin secure cryptography requires design against possible cryptanalysis citation needed Classical ciphers edit First page of AlKindi s 9th century Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages See also Frequency analysis Index of coincidence and Kasiski examination Although the actual word cryptanalysis is relatively recent it was coined by William Friedman in 1920 methods for breaking codes and ciphers are much older David Kahn notes in The Codebreakers that Arab scholars were the first people to systematically document cryptanalytic methods 9 The first known recorded explanation of cryptanalysis was given by AlKindi c 801873 also known as Alkindus in Europe a 9thcentury Arab polymath 10 11 in Risalah fi Istikhraj alMuamma A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages This treatise contains the first description of the method of frequency analysis 12 AlKindi is thus regarded as the first codebreaker in history 13 His breakthrough work was influenced by AlKhalil 717786 who wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels 14 Frequency analysis is the basic tool for breaking most classical ciphers In natural languages certain letters of the alphabet appear more often than others in English E is likely to be the most common letter in any sample of plaintext Similarly the digraph TH is the most likely pair of letters in English and so on Frequency analysis relies on a cipher failing to hide these statistics For example in a simple substitution cipher where each letter is simply replaced with another the most frequent letter in the ciphertext would be a likely candidate for E Frequency analysis of such a cipher is therefore relatively easy provided that the ciphertext is long enough to give a reasonably representative count of the letters of the alphabet that it contains 15 AlKindis invention of the frequency analysis technique for breaking monoalphabetic substitution ciphers 16 17 was the most significant cryptanalytic advance until World War II AlKindis Risalah fi Istikhraj alMuamma described the first cryptanalytic techniques including some for polyalphabetic ciphers cipher classification Arabic phonetics and syntax and most importantly gave the first descriptions on frequency analysis 18 He also covered methods of encipherments cryptanalysis of certain encipherments and statistical analysis of letters and letter combinations in Arabic 19 12 An important contribution of Ibn Adlan 11871268 was on sample size for use of frequency analysis 14 In Europe Italian scholar Giambattista della Porta 15351615 was the author of a seminal work on cryptanalysis De Furtivis Literarum Notis 20 Successful cryptanalysis has undoubtedly influenced history the ability to read the presumedsecret thoughts and plans of others can be a decisive advantage For example in England in 1587 Mary Queen of Scots was tried and executed for treason as a result of her involvement in three plots to assassinate Elizabeth I of England The plans came to light after her coded correspondence with fellow conspirators was deciphered by Thomas Phelippes In Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries the idea of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher was developed among others by the French diplomat Blaise de Vigenère 152396 21 For some three centuries the Vigenère cipher which uses a repeating key to select different encryption alphabets in rotation was considered to be completely secure le chiffre indéchiffrable the indecipherable cipher Nevertheless Charles Babbage 17911871 and later independently Friedrich Kasiski 180581 succeeded in breaking this cipher 22 During World War I inventors in several countries developed rotor cipher machines such as Arthur Scherbius Enigma in an attempt to minimise the repetition that had been exploited to break the Vigenère system 23 Ciphers from World War I and World War II edit See also Cryptanalysis of the Enigma and Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher The decrypted Zimmermann Telegram In World War I the breaking of the Zimmermann Telegram was instrumental in bringing the United States into the war In World War II the Allies benefitted enormously from their joint success cryptanalysis of the German ciphers including the Enigma machine and the Lorenz cipher and Japanese ciphers particularly Purple and JN25 Ultra intelligence has been credited with everything between shortening the end of the European war by up to two years to determining the eventual result The war in the Pacific was similarly helped by Magic intelligence 24 Cryptanalysis of enemy messages played a significant part in the Allied victory in World War II F W Winterbotham quoted the western Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D Eisenhower at the wars end as describing Ultra intelligence as having been decisive to Allied victory 25 Sir Harry Hinsley official historian of British Intelligence in World War II made a similar assessment about Ultra saying that it shortened the war by not less than two years and probably by four years moreover he said that in the absence of Ultra it is uncertain how the war would have ended 26 In practice frequency analysis relies as much on linguistic knowledge as it does on statistics but as ciphers became more complex mathematics became more important in cryptanalysis This change was particularly evident before and during World War II where efforts to crack Axis ciphers required new levels of mathematical sophistication Moreover automation was first applied to cryptanalysis in that era with the Polish Bomba device the British Bombe the use of punched card equipment and in the Colossus computers the first electronic digital computers to be controlled by a program 27 28 Indicator edit With reciprocal machine ciphers such as the Lorenz cipher and the Enigma machine used by Nazi Germany during World War II each message had its own key Usually the transmitting operator informed the receiving operator of this message key by transmitting some plaintext andor ciphertext before the enciphered message This is termed the indicator as it indicates to the receiving operator how to set his machine to decipher the message 29 Poorly designed and implemented indicator systems allowed first Polish cryptographers 30 and then the British cryptographers at Bletchley Park 31 to break the Enigma cipher system Similar poor indicator systems allowed the British to identify depths that led to the diagnosis of the Lorenz SZ4042 cipher system and the comprehensive breaking of its messages without the cryptanalysts seeing the cipher machine 32 Depth edit Sending two or more messages with the same key is an insecure process To a cryptanalyst the messages are then said to be in depth 33 This may be detected by the messages having the same indicator by which the sending operator informs the receiving operator about the key generator initial settings for the message 34 Generally the cryptanalyst may benefit from lining up identical enciphering operations among a set of messages For example the Vernam cipher enciphers by bitforbit combining plaintext with a long key using the exclusive or operator which is also known as modulo2 addition symbolized by Plaintext Key Ciphertext Deciphering combines the same key bits with the ciphertext to reconstruct the plaintext Ciphertext Key Plaintext In modulo2 arithmetic addition is the same as subtraction When two such ciphertexts are aligned in depth combining them eliminates the common key leaving just a combination of the two plaintexts Ciphertext1 Ciphertext2 Plaintext1 Plaintext2 The individual plaintexts can then be worked out linguistically by trying probable words or phrases also known as cribs at various locations a correct guess when combined with the merged plaintext stream produces intelligible text from the other plaintext component Plaintext1 Plaintext2 Plaintext1 Plaintext2 The recovered fragment of the second plaintext can often be extended in one or both directions and the extra characters can be combined with the merged plaintext stream to extend the first plaintext Working back and forth between the two plaintexts using the intelligibility criterion to check guesses the analyst may recover much or all of the original plaintexts With only two plaintexts in depth the analyst may not know which one corresponds to which ciphertext but in practice this is not a large problem When a recovered plaintext is then combined with its ciphertext the key is revealed Plaintext1 Ciphertext1 Key Knowledge of a key of course allows the analyst to read other messages encrypted with the same key and knowledge of a set of related keys may allow cryptanalysts to diagnose the system used for constructing them 32 Development of modern cryptography edit Governments have long recognized the potential benefits of cryptanalysis for intelligence both military and diplomatic and established dedicated organizations devoted to breaking the codes and ciphers of other nations for example GCHQ and the NSA organizations which are still very active today The Bombe replicated the action of several Enigma machines wired together Each of the rapidly rotating drums pictured above in a Bletchley Park museum mockup simulated the action of an Enigma rotor Even though computation was used to great effect in the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher and other systems during World War II it also made possible new methods of cryptography orders of magnitude more complex than ever before Taken as a whole modern cryptography has become much more impervious to cryptanalysis than the penandpaper systems of the past and now seems to have the upper hand against pure cryptanalysis citation needed The historian David Kahn notes mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 Many are the cryptosystems offered by the hundreds of commercial vendors today that cannot be broken by any known methods of cryptanalysis Indeed in such systems even a chosen plaintext attack in which a selected plaintext is matched against its ciphertext cannot yield the key that unlocks other messages In a sense then cryptanalysis is dead But that is not the end of the story Cryptanalysis may be dead but there is to mix my metaphors more than one way to skin a cat 35 Kahn goes on to mention increased opportunities for interception bugging side channel attacks and quantum computers as replacements for the traditional means of cryptanalysis In 2010 former NSA technical director Brian Snow said that both academic and government cryptographers are moving very slowly forward in a mature field 36 However any postmortems for cryptanalysis may be premature While the effectiveness of cryptanalytic methods employed by intelligence agencies remains unknown many serious attacks against both academic and practical cryptographic primitives have been published in the modern era of computer cryptography citation needed The block cipher Madryga proposed in 1984 but not widely used was found to be susceptible to ciphertextonly attacks in 1998 FEAL4 proposed as a replacement for the DES standard encryption algorithm but not widely used was demolished by a spate of attacks from the academic community many of which are entirely practical The A51 A52 CMEA and DECT systems used in mobile and wireless phone technology can all be broken in hours minutes or even in realtime using widely available computing equipment Bruteforce keyspace search has broken some realworld ciphers and applications including singleDES see EFF DES cracker 40bit exportstrength cryptography and the DVD Content Scrambling System In 2001 Wired Equivalent Privacy WEP a protocol used to secure WiFi wireless networks was shown to be breakable in practice because of a weakness in the RC4 cipher and aspects of the WEP design that made relatedkey attacks practical WEP was later replaced by WiFi Protected Access In 2008 researchers conducted a proofofconcept break of SSL using weaknesses in the MD5 hash function and certificate issuer practices that made it possible to exploit collision attacks on hash functions The certificate issuers involved changed their practices to prevent the attack from being repeated Thus while the best modern ciphers may be far more resistant to cryptanalysis than the Enigma cryptanalysis and the broader field of information security remain quite active 37 In 2004 it was reported that the United States had broken Iranian ciphers It is unknown however whether this was pure cryptanalysis or whether other factors were involved 38 Symmetric ciphers edit Boomerang attack Bruteforce attack Davies attack Differential cryptanalysis Impossible differential cryptanalysis Improbable differential cryptanalysis Integral cryptanalysis Linear cryptanalysis Meetinthemiddle attack Modn cryptanalysis Relatedkey attack Sandwich attack Slide attack XSL attack Asymmetric ciphers edit Asymmetric cryptography or public key cryptography is cryptography that relies on using two mathematically related keys one private and one public Such ciphers invariably rely on hard mathematical problems as the basis of their security so an obvious point of attack is to develop methods for solving the problem The security of twokey cryptography depends on mathematical questions in a way that singlekey cryptography generally does not and conversely links cryptanalysis to wider mathematical research in a new way citation needed Asymmetric schemes are designed around the conjectured difficulty of solving various mathematical problems If an improved algorithm can be found to solve the problem then the system is weakened For example the security of the DiffieHellman key exchange scheme depends on the difficulty of calculating the discrete logarithm In 1983 Don Coppersmith found a faster way to find discrete logarithms in certain groups and thereby requiring cryptographers to use larger groups or different types of groups RSAs security depends in part upon the difficulty of integer factorization a breakthrough in factoring would impact the security of RSA citation needed In 1980 one could factor a difficult 50digit number at an expense of 10 12 elementary computer operations By 1984 the state of the art in factoring algorithms had advanced to a point where a 75digit number could be factored in 10 12 operations Advances in computing technology also meant that the operations could be performed much faster too Moores law predicts that computer speeds will continue to increase Factoring techniques may continue to do so as well but will most likely depend on mathematical insight and creativity neither of which has ever been successfully predictable 150digit numbers of the kind once used in RSA have been factored The effort was greater than above but was not unreasonable on fast modern computers By the start of the 21st century 150digit numbers were no longer considered a large enough key size for RSA Numbers with several hundred digits were still considered too hard to factor in 2005 though methods will probably continue to improve over time requiring key size to keep pace or other methods such as elliptic curve cryptography to be used citation needed Another distinguishing feature of asymmetric schemes is that unlike attacks on symmetric cryptosystems any cryptanalysis has the opportunity to make use of knowledge gained from the public key 39 Attacking cryptographic hash systems edit This section needs expansion You can help
