Future v t e Ancient history as a term refers to the aggregate of past events 1 from the beginning of writing and recorded human history and extending as far as the postclassical history The phrase may be used either to refer to the period of time or the academic discipline The span of recorded history is roughly 5000 years beginning with Sumerian Cuneiform script the oldest discovered form of coherent writing from the protoliterate period around the 30th century BC 2 Ancient history covers all continents inhabited by humans in the 3000 BC AD 500 period The broad term ancient history is not to be confused with Classical Antiquity The term classical antiquity is often used to refer to Western History in the Ancient Mediterranean from the beginning of recorded Greek history in 776 BC First Olympiad This roughly coincides with the traditional date of the Founding of Rome in 753 BC the beginning of the history of ancient Rome and the beginning of the Archaic period in Ancient Greece The academic term history is not to be confused with colloquial references to times past History is fundamentally the study of the past through documents and can be either scientific archaeology or humanistic history through language Although the ending date of ancient history is disputed some Western scholars use the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD the most used 3 4 the closure of the Platonic Academy in 529 AD 5 the death of the emperor Justinian I in 565 AD 6 the coming of Islam 7 or the rise of Charlemagne 8 as the end of ancient and Classical European history Outside of Europe the 450500 time frame for the end of ancient times has had difficulty as a transition date from Ancient to PostClassical times During the time period of ancient history starting roughly from 3000 BC the world population was already exponentially increasing due to the Neolithic Revolution which was in full progress According to HYDE estimates from the Netherlands world population increased exponentially in this period In 10000 BC in Prehistory the world population had stood at 2 million rising to 45 million by 3000 BC By the rise of the Iron Age in 1000 BC the population had risen to 72 million By the end of the period in 500 AD the world population is thought to have stood at 209 million In 3500 years the world population increased by 100 times 9 mwparseroutput toclimit2 toclevel1

the excavation and study of artifacts in an effort to interpret and reconstruct past human behavior 13 14 15 16 Archaeologists excavate the ruins of ancient cities looking for clues as to how the people of the time period lived Some important discoveries by archaeologists studying ancient history include The Egyptian pyramids 17 giant tombs built by the ancient Egyptians beginning about 2600 BC as the final resting places of their royalty The study of the ancient cities of Harappa Pakistan 18 Mohenjodaro Pakistan and Lothal 19 in India South Asia The city of Pompeii Italy 20 an ancient Roman city preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 Its state of preservation is so great that it is a valuable window into Roman culture and provided insight into the cultures of the Etruscans and the Samnites 21 The Terracotta Army 22 the mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor in ancient China The discovery of Knossos by Minos Kalokairinos and Sir Arthur Evans The discovery of Troy by Heinrich Schliemann Source text edit Main article Source text Most of what is known of the ancient world comes from the accounts of antiquitys own historians Although it is important to take into account the bias of each ancient author their accounts are the basis for our understanding of the ancient past Some of the more notable ancient writers include Herodotus Thucydides Arrian Plutarch Polybius Sima Qian Sallust Livy Josephus Suetonius and Tacitus A fundamental difficulty of studying ancient history is that recorded histories cannot document the entirety of human events and only a fraction of those documents have survived into the present day 23 Furthermore the reliability of the information obtained from these surviving records must be considered 23 24 Few people were capable of writing histories as literacy was not widespread in almost any culture until long after the end of ancient history 25 The earliest known systematic historical thought emerged in ancient Greece beginning with Herodotus of Halicarnassus 484c 425 BC Thucydides largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta 26 establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event 26 The Roman Empire was an ancient culture with a relatively high literacy rate 27 but many works by its most widely read historians are lost For example Livy a Roman historian who lived in the 1st century BC wrote a history of Rome called Ab Urbe Condita From the Founding of the City in 144 volumes only 35 volumes still exist although short summaries of most of the rest do exist Indeed no more than a minority of the work of any major Roman

Sumerian city states had collectively formed civilization with government religion division of labor and writing Among the city states Ur was among the most significant In the 24th century BC the Akkadian Empire 32 33 was founded in Mesopotamia From Sumer civilization and bronze smelting spread westward to Egypt the Minoans and the Hittites The First Intermediate Period of Egypt of the 22nd

message Main article Iron Age The Iron Age is the last principal period in the threeage system preceded by the Bronze Age Its date and context vary depending on the country or geographical region The Iron Age over all was characterized by the prevalent smelting of iron with Ferrous metallurgy and the use of Carbon steel Smelted iron proved more durable than earlier metals such as Copper or Bronze and allowed for more productive societies The Iron Age took place at different times in different parts of the world and comes to an end when a society began to maintain historical records Map of the late Bronze Age collapse c 1200 BC During the 13th to 12th centuries BC the Ramesside Period occurred in Egypt Around 1200BC the Trojan War was thought to have taken place 35 By around 1180BC the disintegration of the Hittite Empire was under way The collapse of the Hitties was part of the larger scale Bronze Age Collapse which took place in the Ancient Near East around 1200BC In Greece the Mycenae and Minona both disintegrated A wave of Sea Peoples attacked many countries only Egypt survived intact Afterwards some entirely new successor civilizations arose in the Eastern Mediterranean In 1046 BC the Zhou force led by King Wu of Zhou overthrew the last king of the Shang dynasty The Zhou dynasty was established in China shortly thereafter During this Zhou era China embraced a feudal society of decentralized power Iron Age China then dissolved into the warring states period where possibly millions of soldiers fought each other over feudal struggles Pirak is an early ironage site in Balochistan Pakistan going back to about 1200BC This period is believed to be the beginning of the Iron Age in India and the subcontinent 36 Around the same time came the Vedas the oldest sacred texts for the Hindu Religion In 1000BC the Mannaean Kingdom began in Western Asia Around the 10th to 7th centuries BC the NeoAssyrian Empire developed in Mesopotamia 37 In 800BC the rise of Greek citystates began In 776BC the first recorded Olympic Games were held 38 In contrast to neighboring cultures the Greek City states did not become a single militaristic empire but competed with each other as separate polis Axial Age edit Main article Axial Age The preceding Iron Age is often thought to have ended in the Middle East around 550 BC due to the rise of Historiography the historical record The Axial Age is used to describe history between 800 and 200 BC of Eurasia including Ancient Greece Iran India and China Widespread trade and communication between distinct regions in this period including the rise of the Silk Road This period saw the rise of philosophy and proselytizing religions Philosophy religion and science were diverse in the Hundred Schools of Thought producing thinkers such as Confucius Lao Tzu and Mozi during the sixth century BC Similar trends emerged throughout Eurasia in India with the rise of Buddhism in the Near East with Zoroastrianism and Judaism and in the west with Ancient Greek Philosophy In these developments religious and philosophical figures were all searching for human meaning 39 The Axial Age and its aftermath saw large wars and the formation of large empires that stretched beyond the limits of earlier Iron Age Societies Significant for the time was the Persian Achaemenid Empire 40 The empires vast territory extended from modern day Egypt to Xinjiang The empires legacy include the rise of commerce over land routes through Eurasia as well as the spreading of Persian culture through the middle east The Royal Road allowed for efficient trade and taxation Though Macedonian Alexander the Great conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety the unity of Alexanders conquests did not survive past his lifetime Greek culture and technology spread through West and South Asia often synthesizing with local cultures Formation of Empires and Fragmentation Separate Greek Kingdoms Egypt and Asia encouraged trade and communication like earlier Persian administrations 41 Combined with the expansion of the Han Dynasty westward the Silk Road as a series of routes made possible the exchange of goods between the Mediterranean Basin South Asia and East Asia In South Asia the Mauryan empire briefly annexed much of the Indian Subcontinent though short lived its reign had the legacies of spreading Buddhism and providing an inspiration to later Indian states Supplanting the warring Greek Kingdoms in the western world came the growing Roman Republic and the Iranian Parthian Empire As a result of empires urbanization and literary spread to locations which had previously been at the periphery of civilization as known by the large empires Upon the turn of the millennium the independence of tribal peoples and smaller kingdoms were threatened by more advanced states Empires were not just remarkable for their territorial size but for their administration and the dissemination of culture and trade in this way the influence of empires often extended far beyond their national boundaries Trade routes expanded by land and sea and allowed for flow of goods between distant regions even in the absence of communication Distant nations such as Imperial Rome and the Chinese Han Dynasty rarely communicated but trade of goods did occur as evidenced by archaeological discoveries such as Roman coins in Vietnam At this time most of the worlds population inhabited only a small part of the earths surface Outside of civilization large geographic areas such as Siberia Sub Saharan Africa and Australia remained sparsely populated The New World hosted a variety of separate civilizations in the but its own trade networks were smaller due to the lack of draft animals and the wheel Empires with their immense military strength remained fragile to civil wars economic decline and a changing political environment internationally In 220 AD Han China collapsed into warring states while the European Roman Empire began to suffer from turmoil in the Third Century Crisis In Persia regime change took place from Parthian Empire to the more centralized Sassanian Empire The land based Silk Road continued to deliver profits in trade but came under continual assault by nomads all on the northern frontiers of Eurasian nations Safer sea routes began to gain preference in the early centuries AD Proselytizing religions began to replace polytheism and folk religions in many areas Christianity gained a wide following in the Roman Empire Zoroastrianism became the state enforced religion of Iran and Buddhism spread to East Asia from South Asia Social change political transformation as well as ecological events all contributed to the end of Ancient Times and the beginning of the Post Classical

for local conditions The rise of civilization corresponded with the institutional sponsorship of belief in gods supernatural forces and the afterlife During the Bronze Age many civilizations adopted their own form of Polytheism Usually polytheistic Gods manifested human personalities strengths and failings Early religion was often based on location with cities or entire countries selecting a deity that would grant them preferences and advantages over their competitors Worship involved the construction of representation of deities and the granting of sacrifices Sacrifices could be material goods food or in extreme cases human sacrifice to please a deity New philosophies and religions arose in both east and west particularly about the 6th century BC Over time a great variety of religions developed around the world with some of the earliest major ones being Hinduism Buddhism and Jainism in India and Zoroastrianism in Persia The Abrahamic religions trace their origin to Judaism around 1800 BC The ancient Indian philosophy is a fusion of two ancient traditions Sramana tradition and Vedic tradition Indian philosophy begins with the Vedas where questions related to laws of nature the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked Jainism and Buddhism are continuation of the Sramana school of thought The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic world view of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities They laid stress on philosophical concepts like Ahimsa Karma Jnana Samsara and Moksa While there are ancient relations between the Indian Vedas and the Iranian Avesta the two main families of the IndoIranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human beings position in society and their view on the role of man in the universe In the east three schools of thought were to dominate Chinese thinking until the modern day These were Taoism Legalism and Confucianism The Confucian tradition which would attain dominance looked for political morality not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition Confucianism would later spread into the Korean peninsula and Goguryeo 42 and toward Japan In the west the Greek philosophical tradition represented by Socrates Plato and Aristotle was diffused throughout Europe and the Middle East in the 4th century BC by the conquests of Alexander III of Macedon more commonly known as Alexander the Great After the Bronze and Iron Age religions formed the rise and spread of Christianity through the Roman

period and beyond Inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks such as the gear screw bronze casting techniques water clock water organ torsion catapult and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war Roman technology is the engineering practice which supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years The Roman Empire had the most advanced set of technology of their time some of which may have been lost during the turbulent eras of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages Roman technological feats of many different areas like civil engineering construction materials transport technology and some inventions such as the mechanical reaper went unmatched until the 19th century citation needed Maritime activity edit Main article Ancient maritime history The history of ancient navigation began in earnest when men took to the sea in planked boats and ships propelled by sails hung on masts like the Ancient Egyptian Khufu ship from the mid3rd millennium BC According to the Greek historian Herodotus Necho II sent out an expedition of Phoenicians which in three years sailed from the Red Sea around Africa to the mouth of the Nile Many current historians tend to believe Herodotus on this point even though Herodotus himself was in disbelief that the Phoenicians had accomplished the act Hannu was an ancient Egyptian explorer around 2750 BC and the first explorer of whom there is any knowledge He made the first recorded exploring expedition writing his account of his exploration in stone Hannu travelled along the Red Sea to Punt and sailed to what is now part of eastern Ethiopia and Somalia He returned to Egypt with great treasures including precious myrrh metal and wood Warfare edit Technical drawing of Roman Ballista mechanism Main article Ancient warfare Ancient warfare is war as conducted from the beginnings of recorded history to the end of the ancient period In Europe the end of antiquity is often equated with the fall of Rome in 476 In China it can also be seen as ending in the 5th century with the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the evergrowing threat from the north The difference between prehistoric warfare and ancient warfare is less one of technology than of organization The development of the first citystates and then empires allowed warfare to change dramatically Beginning in Mesopotamia states produced sufficient agricultural surplus that fulltime ruling elites and military commanders could emerge While the bulk of military forces were still farmers the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year Thus organized armies developed for the first time These new armies could help states grow in size and became increasingly centralized and the first empire that of the Sumerians formed in Mesopotamia Early ancient armies continued to primarily use bows and spears the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting Early armies in Egypt and China followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears Artwork and music edit Ancient art history Middle East Mesopotamia

two major cities Assur and Nineveh wedged between Babylonia downstream and the states of Mitanni and Hatti upstream Mesopotamia edit Main article Mesopotamia Mesopotamia is the site of some of the earliest known civilizations in the world Early settlement of the alluvial plain lasted from the Ubaid period late 6th millennium BC through the Uruk period 4th millennium BC and the Dynastic periods 3rd millennium BC until the rise of Babylon in the early 2nd millennium BC The surplus of storable foodstuffs created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating after crops and herds It also allowed for a much greater population density and in turn required an extensive labor force and division of labor This organization led to the necessity of record keeping and the development of writing c 3500 BC Babylonia was an Amorite state in lower Mesopotamia modern southern Iraq with Babylon as its capital Babylonia emerged when Hammurabi fl c 17281686 BC according to the short chronology created an empire out of the territories of the former kingdoms of Sumer and Akkad The Amorites being ancient Semiticspeaking peoples Babylonia adopted the written Akkadian language for official use they retained the Sumerian language for religious use which by that time was no longer a spoken language The Akkadian and Sumerian cultures played a major role in later Babylonian culture and the region would remain an important cultural center even under outside rule The earliest mention of the city of Babylon can be found in a tablet from the reign of Sargon of Akkad dating back to the 23rd century BC The NeoBabylonian Empire or Chaldea was Babylonia under the rule of the 11th Chaldean dynasty from the revolt of Nabopolassar in 626 BC until the invasion of Cyrus the Great in 539 BC Notably it included the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II who conquered the Kingdom of Judah and Jerusalem Akkad was a city and its surrounding region in central Mesopotamia Akkad also became the capital of the Akkadian Empire 44 The city was probably situated on the west bank of the Euphrates between Sippar and Kish in presentday Iraq about 50km 31mi southwest of the center of Baghdad Despite an extensive search the precise site has never been found Akkad reached the height of its power between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC following the conquests of king Sargon of Akkad Because of the policies of the Akkadian Empire toward linguistic assimilation Akkad also gave its name to the predominant Semitic dialect the Akkadian language reflecting use of akkadû in the language of Akkad in the Old Babylonian period to denote the Semitic version of a Sumerian text Assyria was originally in the Middle Bronze Age a region on the Upper Tigris named for its original capital the ancient city of Assur Later as a nation and empire that came to control all of the Fertile Crescent Egypt and much of Anatolia the term Assyria proper referred to roughly the northern half of Mesopotamia the southern half being Babylonia with Nineveh as its capital The Assyrian kings controlled a large kingdom at three different times in history These are called the Old 20th to 15th centuries BC Middle 15th to 10th centuries BC and NeoAssyrian 911612 BC kingdoms or periods of which the last is the most well known and best documented Assyrians invented excavation to undermine city walls battering rams to knock down gates as well as the concept of a corps of engineers who bridged rivers with pontoons or provided soldiers with inflatable skins for swimming 45 Mitanni was an IndoIranian 46 empire in northern Mesopotamia from c 1500 BC At the height of Mitanni power during the 14th century BC it encompassed what is today southeastern Turkey northern Syria and northern Iraq

52 53 According to available written records it is known to have existed from around 3200 BC making it among the worlds oldest historical civilizations and to have endured up until 539 BC Its culture played a crucial role in the Gutian Empire especially during the Achaemenid dynasty that succeeded it when the Elamite language remained among those in official use The Elamite period is considered a starting point for the history of Iran The Medes were an ancient Iranian people They had established their own empire by the 6th century BC having defeated the NeoAssyrian Empire with the Chaldeans They overthrew Urartu later on as well The Medes are credited with the foundation of the first Iranian empire the largest of its day until Cyrus the Great established a unified Iranian empire of the Medes and Persian often referred to as the Achaemenid Persian Empire by defeating his grandfather and overlord Astyages the king of Media The Persian Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent c 500 BC The Achaemenid Empire was the largest and most significant of the Persian Empires and followed the Median Empire as the second great empire of the Iranians It is noted in western history as the foe of the Greek city states in the GrecoPersian Wars for freeing the Israelites from their Babylonian captivity for its successful model of a centralized bureaucratic administration the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and for instituting Aramaic as the empires official language Because of the Empires vast extent and long endurance Persian influence upon

an Iranian civilization situated in the northeastern part of modern Iran Their power was based on a combination of the guerrilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe with organizational skills to build and administer a vast empire even though it never matched in power and extent the Persian empires that preceded and followed it The Parthian Empire was led by the Arsacid dynasty which reunited and ruled over significant portions of the Near East and beyond after defeating and disposing the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire beginning in the late 3rd century BC It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran after the Median and the Achaemenid dynasties Parthia had many wars with the Roman Republic and subsequently the Roman Empire which marked the start of what would be over 700 years of

1209BC Israel is laid waste and his seed is no more 62 This Israel was a cultural and probably political entity of the central highlands well enough established to be perceived by the Egyptians as a possible challenge to their hegemony but an ethnic group rather than an organised state 63 Archaeologist Paula McNutt says It is probably during Iron Age I that a population began to identify itself as Israelite differentiating itself from its neighbours via prohibitions on intermarriage an emphasis on family history and genealogy and religion 64 Israel had emerged by the middle of the 9th century BC when the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III names Ahab the Israelite among his enemies at the battle of Qarqar 853 Judah emerged somewhat later than Israel probably during the 9th century BC but the subject is one of considerable controversy 65 Israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding neoAssyrian empire which first split its territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital Samaria 722 A series of campaigns by the NeoBabylonian Empire between 597 and 582 led to the destruction of Judah Followed by the fall of Babylon to the Persian empire Jews were allowed by Cyrus the Great to return to Judea The Hasmonean Kingdom followed by the Maccabean revolt had existed during the Hellenistic period and then the Herodian kingdom during the Roman period

geographically located in northeastern Africa It was concentrated along the middle to lower reaches of the Nile River reaching its greatest extension during the 2nd millennium BC which is referred to as the New Kingdom period It reached broadly from the Nile Delta in the north as far south as Jebel Barkal at the Fourth Cataract of the Nile Extensions to the geographical range of ancient Egyptian civilization included at different times areas of the southern Levant the Eastern Desert and the Red Sea coastline the Sinai Peninsula and the Western Desert focused on the several oases Ancient Egypt developed over at least three and a half millennia It began with the incipient unification of Nile Valley polities around 3500 BC and is conventionally thought to have ended in 30 BC when the early Roman Empire conquered and absorbed Ptolemaic Egypt as a province Though this last did not represent the first period of foreign domination the Roman period was to witness a marked if gradual transformation in the political and religious life of the Nile Valley effectively marking the termination of independent civilisational development The civilization of ancient Egypt was based on a finely balanced control of natural and human resources characterised primarily by controlled irrigation of the fertile Nile Valley the mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions the early development of an independent writing system and literature the organisation of collective projects trade with surrounding regions in east central Africa and the eastern Mediterranean finally military ventures that exhibited strong characteristics of imperial hegemony and territorial domination of neighbouring cultures at different periods Motivating and organizing these activities

Egyptian incursion into the area The first cultures arose in what is now Sudan before the time of a unified Egypt and the most widespread culture is known as the Kerma civilization Egyptians referred to Nubia as TaSeti or The Land of the Bow since the Nubians were known to be expert archers The two civilization shared an abundance of peaceful cultural interchange and cooperation including mixed marriages and even the same gods In the New Kingdom Nubians became indistinguishable in the archaeological record from Egyptians The Kingdom of Kush survived longer than that of Egypt and at its greatest extent Nubia ruled over Egypt under the leadership of king Piye and controlled Egypt during the 8th century BC as the 25th Dynasty 67 It is also referred to as Ethiopia in ancient Greek and Roman records According to Josephus and other classical writers the Kushite Empire covered all of Africa and some parts of Asia and Europe at one time or another In contrast to the Egyptians the Nubians had an unusually high number of ruling queens also known as Kandake especially during the golden age of the Meroitic Kingdom Unlike the rest of the world at the time women in Nubia exercised significant control in society 68 The Kushites are also famous for having buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves The Kushites also built burial mounds and pyramids and

ebony ivory slaves and wild animals 69 Information about Punt has been found in ancient Egyptian records of trade missions to this regionThe exact location of Punt remains a mystery The mainstream view is that Punt was located to the southeast of Egypt most likely on the coast of the Horn of Africa Archaeologist Richard Pankhurst academic states Punt has been identified with territory on both the Arabian and the Horn of Africa coasts Consideration of the articles that the Egyptians obtained from Punt notably gold and ivory suggests however that these were primarily of African origin This leads us to suppose that the term Punt probably applied more to African than Arabian territory 69 70 71 72 The earliest recorded Egyptian expedition to Punt was organized by Pharaoh Sahure of the

within the Yellow River Valley is one of five original civilizations in the world Prior to the formation of civilization neolithic cultures such as the Longshan and Yangshao dating to 5000 BC lived in wall cities and likely had social organizations of complex chiefdoms The practice of rice cultivation was vital to settled life in China Chinese history records such as the Records of the Grand Historian claim of the existence of the Xia Dynasty However as the Xia left behind no written record themselves the time and location of their civilization has been in doubt Some historians believe that the neolithic Erlitou culture 19001600 BC is the Xia Dynasty but whether archaeological discoveries in the area Xia Dynasty or a different culture remains in doubt 89 90 The early part of the Shang dynasty described in traditional histories c 16001300 is commonly identified with archaeological finds at Erligang Zhengzhou and Yanshi south of the Yellow River in modernday Henan provinceThe last capital of the Shang c 13001046 BC at Anyang also in Henan has been directly confirmed by the discovery there of the earliest Chinese texts inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animals the socalled oracle bones Towards the end of the 2nd millennium BC the Shang were overrun by the Zhou dynasty from the Wei River valley to the west The death of King Wu of Zhou soon after the conquest triggered a succession crisis and civil war that was suppressed by Wus brother the Duke of Zhou acting as regent The Zhou rulers at this time invoked the concept of the Mandate of Heaven to legitimize their rule a concept that would be influential for almost every successive dynasty The Zhou initially established their capital in the west near modern Xian near the Yellow River but they would preside over a series of expansions into the Yangtze River valley This would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in Chinese history Terracotta Warriors from the time of Qin Shi Huang In the 8th century BC power became decentralized during the Spring and Autumn period named after the influential Spring and Autumn Annals In this period local military leaders used by the Zhou began to assert their power and vie for hegemony The situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest such as the Quanrong forcing the Zhou to move their capital east to Luoyang This marks the second large phase of the Zhou dynasty the Eastern Zhou In each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the Zhou kings in name only Local leaders for instance started using royal titles for themselves The Hundred Schools of Thought of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period and such influential intellectual movements as Confucianism Taoism Legalism and Mohism were founded partly in response to the changing political world The Spring and Autumn period is marked by a falling apart of the central Zhou power China now consisted of hundreds of states some only as large as a village with a fort After further political consolidation seven prominent states remained by the end of the 5th century BC and the years in which these few states battled each other is known as the Warring States period Though there remained a nominal Zhou king until 256 BC he was largely a figurehead and held little power As neighboring territories of these warring states including areas of modern Sichuan and Liaoning were annexed they were governed under the new local administrative system of commandery and prefecture This system had been in use since the Spring and Autumn period and parts can still be seen in the modern system of Sheng and Xian province and county The final expansion in this period began during the reign of Ying Zheng the king of Qin His unification of the other six powers and further annexations in the modern regions of Zhejiang Fujian Guangdong and Guangxi in 214 BC enabled him to proclaim himself the First Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi The Chinese Han Dynasty dominated the East Asia region at the beginning of the first millennium AD Qin Shi Huangdi ruled the unified China directly with absolute power In contrast to the decentralized and feudal rule of earlier dynasties the Qin set up a number of commandries around the country which answered directly to the emperor Nationwide the philosophy of legalism was enforced and publications promoting rival ideas such as Confucianism were prohibited In his reign unified China created the first continuous Great Wall with the use of forced labor Invasions were launched southward to annex Vietnam After the emperors death rebels rose against the Qins brutal reign in new civil wars Ultimately the Han Dynasty arose and ruled China for over four centuries in what accounted for a long period in prosperity with a brief interruption by the Xin Dynasty The Han Dynasty played a great role in developing the Silk Road which would transfer wealth and ideas for millennia and also invented paper Though the Han enjoyed great military and economic success it was strained by the rise of aristocrats who disobeyed the central government Public frustration provoked the Yellow Turban Rebellion though a failure it nonetheless accelerated the empires downfall After 208 AD

of horses to herd and migrate started during the Iron Age These were Tengriist horseriding pastoral kingdoms that had close contact with the sedentary agrarian Chinese To appease the aggressive nomads local Chinese rulers often gave important hostages and arranged marriages In 208 BC the Xiongnu emperor Modu Chanyu in his first major military campaign defeated the Donghu who split into the new tribes Xianbei and Wuhuan The Xiongnu were the largest nomadic enemies of the Han Dynasty fighting wars for over three centuries with the Han Dynasty before dissolving Afterwards the Xianbei returned

was founded by General Wiman from China who originally served but usurped the throne of Gojoseon the name of ancient Korea in 194 BC 91 In 108 BC the Han dynasty of China destroyed Wiman Joseon and established four commanderies on the northern Korean peninsula Three of the commanderies were shortly lost but the Lelang commandery remained on the northwestern Korean peninsula for about 400 years The Three Kingdoms of Korea of Baekje Goguryeo and Silla emerged after the fall of Gojoseon and eventually expelled the Chinese The Three Kingdoms competed with each other both economically and militarily Goguryeo and Baekje were the main players for much of the Three Kingdoms era and controlled most of the Korean peninsula At times more powerful than neighboring Chinese dynasties Goguryeo where the name Korea comes from was a regional power that defeated massive invasions by the Sui dynasty multiple times 92 Goguryeo and Baekje were eventually destroyed by a Tang dynasty and Silla

Greece Ancient Greece is the period in Greek history lasting for close to a millennium until the rise of Christianity It is considered by most historians to be the foundational culture of Western Civilization Greek culture was a powerful influence in the Roman Empire which carried a version of it to many parts of Europe The earliest known human settlements in Greece were on the island of Crete more than 9000 years ago though there is evidence of tool use on the island going back over 100000 years 110 The earliest evidence of a civilisation in ancient Greece is that of the Minoans on Crete dating as far back as 3600 BC On the mainland the Mycenaean civilisation rose to prominence around 1600 BC superseded the Minoan civilisation on Crete and lasted until about 1100 BC leading to a period known as the Greek Dark Ages The Archaic Period in Greece is generally considered to have lasted from around the eighth century BC to the invasion by Xerxes in 480 BC This period saw the expansion of the Greek world around the Mediterranean with the founding of Greek citystates as far afield as Sicily in the West and the Black sea in the East 111 Politically the Archaic period in Greece saw the collapse of the power of the old aristocracies 112 with democratic reforms in Athens and the development of Spartas unique constitution The end of the Archaic period also saw the rise of Athens which would come to be a dominant power in the Classical period after the reforms of Solon and the tyranny of Pisistratus 112 The Classical Greek world was dominated throughout the fifth century BC by the major powers of Athens and Sparta Through the Delian League Athens was able to convert Panhellenist sentiment and fear of the Persian threat into a powerful empire and this along with the conflict between Sparta and Athens culminating in the Peloponnesian war was the major political development of the first part of the Classical period 113 The period in Greek history from the death of Alexander the Great until the rise of the Roman empire and its conquest of Egypt in 30 BC is known as the Hellenistic period The name derives from the Greek word Hellenistes the Greek speaking ones and describes the spread of Greek culture into the nonGreek world following the conquests of Alexander and the rise of his successors Following the Battle of Corinth in 146 BC Greece came under Roman rule ruled from the province of Macedonia In 27 BC Augustus organised the Greek peninsula into the province of Achaea Greece remained under Roman control until the break up of the Roman empire in which it remained part of the Eastern Empire Much of Greece remained under Byzantine control until the end of the Byzantine empire in 1453 AD Main article Ancient Rome Roman Empire 117 AD The Senatorial Provinces marked on the map were considered to be the developed areas of the empire by Ancient Romans Ancient Rome was a civilization that grew out of the citystate of Rome originating as a small agricultural community founded on the Italian Peninsula in the 9th century BC In its twelve centuries of existence Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to an oligarchic republic to an increasingly autocratic empire Roman civilization is often grouped into classical antiquity with ancient Greece a civilization that inspired much of the culture of ancient Rome Ancient Rome contributed greatly to the development of law war art literature architecture and language in the Western world and its history continues to have a major influence on the world today The Roman civilization came to dominate Europe and the Mediterranean region through conquest and assimilation Throughout the territory under the control of ancient Rome residential architecture ranged from very modest houses to country villas A number of Roman founded cities had monumental structures Many contained fountains with fresh drinkingwater supplied by hundreds of miles of aqueducts theatres gymnasiums bath complexes sometime with libraries and shops marketplaces and occasionally functional sewers A number of factors led to the eventual decline of the Roman Empire The western half of the empire including Hispania Gaul and Italy eventually broke into independent kingdoms in the 5th century the Eastern Roman Empire governed from Constantinople is referred to as the Byzantine Empire after AD 476 the traditional date for the fall of Rome and subsequent onset of the Middle Ages Further information Culture of ancient Rome Late Antiquity edit The Age of Migrations in Europe was deeply detrimental to the late Roman Empire Main article Late Antiquity The Roman Empire underwent considerable social cultural and organizational change starting with reign of Diocletian who began the custom of splitting the Empire into Eastern and Western halves ruled by multiple emperors Beginning with Constantine the Great the Empire was Christianized and a new capital founded at Constantinople Migrations of Germanic tribes disrupted Roman rule from the late 4th century onwards culminating in the eventual collapse of the Empire in the West in 476 replaced by the socalled barbarian kingdoms The resultant cultural fusion of GrecoRoman Germanic and Christian traditions formed the cultural foundations of Europe Nomads and Iron Age Peoples edit The Huns left practically no written records There is no record of what happened between the time they left Mongolian Plateau and arrived in Europe 150 years later The last mention of the northern Xiongnu was their defeat by the Chinese in 151 at the lake of Barkol 114 after which they fled to the western steppe at Kangju centered on the city of Turkistan in Kazakhstan Chinese records between the 3rd and 4th centuries suggest that a small tribe called Yueban remnants of Northern Xiongnu was distributed about the steppe of Kazakhstan The HunXiongnu connection is controversial at best and is often disputed but is also not completely discredited 115 116 117 Historians have estimated that the origins of the Huns came somewheres from within Kazakhstan 118 Approaching the Danube River in 370 AD the Huns would repeatedly invaded Europe and wreaked havoc on the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity They later dissolved and became part of the native population The expansion of the Germanic tribes 750BC AD1 after the Penguin Atlas of World History 1988 Settlements before 750BC New settlements by 500BC New settlements by 250BC New settlements by AD1 The Celts were a diverse group of tribal societies in Iron Age Europe ProtoCeltic culture formed in the Early Iron Age in Central Europe Hallstatt period named for the site in presentday Austria By the later Iron Age La Tène period Celts had expanded over wide range of lands as far west as Ireland and the Iberian Peninsula as far east as Galatia central Anatolia and as far north as Scotland 119 By the early centuries AD following the expansion of the Roman Empire and the Great Migrations of Germanic peoples Celtic culture had becomerestricted to the British Isles Insular Celtic with the Continental Celtic languages extinct by the mid1st millennium AD Migration of Germanic peoples to Britain from what is now northern Germany and southern Scandinavia is attested from the 5th century eg Undley bracteate 120 Based on Bedes Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum the intruding population is traditionally divided into Angles Saxons and Jutes but their composition was likely less clearcut and may also have included ancient Frisians and Franks The AngloSaxon Chronicle contains text that may be the first recorded indications of the movement of these Germanic Tribes to Britain 121 The Angles and Saxons and Jutes were noted to be a confederation in the Greek Geographia written by Ptolemy in around AD 150 AngloSaxon is the term usually used to describe the peoples living in the south and east of Great Britain from the early 5th century AD 122 Benedictine monk Bede identified them as the descendants of three Germanic tribes the Angles the Saxons and the Jutes from the Jutland peninsula and Lower Saxony German Niedersachsen Germany The Angles may have come from Angeln and Bede wrote their nation came to Britain leaving their land empty 123 They spoke closely related Germanic dialects The AngloSaxons knew themselves as the Englisc from which the word English derives Viking refers to a member of the Norse Scandinavian peoples famous as explorers warriors merchants and pirates who raided and colonized wide areas of Europe beginning in the late 8th 124 These Norsemen used their famed longships to travel The Viking Age forms a major part of Scandinavian history with a minor yet significant part in European history

Crisis of the 3rd century c 284 to the Islamic conquests and the reorganization of the Byzantine Empire under Heraclius that occurred in the seventh century The beginning of the postclassical age known as the Middle Ages for Europe following the fall of the Western Roman Empire spanning roughly from AD 500 to 1500 Aspects of continuity with the earlier classical period are discussed in greater detail under the heading Late Antiquity There has been attempt by scholars to connect European Late Antiquity to other areas in Eurasia 125 To an extent most centralized kingdoms within proximity to Steppe grasslands faced major challenges or in some cases complete destruction in the 5th6th century in the case of nomadic invasions and political fragmentation The Western Roman Empire in Europe and the Gupta Empire in India and the Jin in North China were overwhelmed by tribal invasions Nomadic invasions along with worldwide natural climate change the Plague of Justinian and the rise of proselytizing religions changed the face of the Old World Still disconnected was the New World who also built complex societies but at a separate and different pace By 500 the world era of Postclassical history had begun Despite being placed in different eras of history in an academic view of world history Ancient and Post Classical eras are linked with each other in the case of the Old World Land and coastal trade routes often went on similar or the same directions and many of the inventions and religions which were birthed prior to 500 AD such as Christianity Judaism Hinduism and
