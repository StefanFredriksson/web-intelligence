IBM 402 An IBM 403 accounting machine with builtin printer left wired to an IBM 514 summary punch center IBM 402 control panel wiring This board was labeled profit loss summary The IBM 402 and IBM 403 Accounting Machines were tabulating machines introduced by International Business Machines in the late 1940s Contents 1 Overview 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Overview edit The 402 could read punched cards at a speed of 80 to 150 cards per minute depending on process options while printing data at a speed of up to 100 lines per minute The builtin line printer used 43 alphanumerical type bars leftside and 45 numerical type bars rightside shorter bars to print a total of 88 positions across a line of a report 1 The IBM 403 added the ability to print up to three lines such as a multiline shipping address from a single punchcard instead of just one line per card with the 402 1 The 402 and 403 were primarily controlled by a removable control panel Additional controls included a carriage control tape and mechanical levers called hammersplits and hammerlocks that controlled some printing functions 1 Both the IBM 402 and IBM 403 were considered smaller models of the prior model IBM 405 In July 2010 a group from the Computer History Museum reported that an IBM 402 was still in operation at a filter manufacturing company in Conroe Texas 2 See also edit IBM 407 IBM 711 Keypunch References edit a b c IBM Accounting Machine 402 403 and 419 Principles of Operation PDF 1963 Form 224565413 mwparseroutput citecitationfontstyleinheritmwparseroutput citation qquotesmwparseroutput citation cs1lockfree abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb665Lockgreensvg9pxLockgreensvgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput citation cs1locklimited amwparseroutput citation cs1lockregistration abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbdd6Lockgrayalt2svg9pxLockgrayalt2svgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput citation cs1locksubscription abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbaaaLockredalt2svg9pxLockredalt2svgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput cs1subscriptionmwparseroutput cs1registrationcolor555mwparseroutput cs1subscription spanmwparseroutput cs1registration spanborderbottom1px dottedcursorhelpmwparseroutput cs1wsicon abackgroundurluploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumb44cWikisourcelogosvg12pxWikisourcelogosvgpngnorepeatbackgroundpositionright 1em centermwparseroutput codecs1codecolorinheritbackgroundinheritborderinheritpaddinginheritmwparseroutput cs1hiddenerrordisplaynonefontsize100mwparseroutput cs1visibleerrorfontsize100mwparseroutput cs1maintdisplaynonecolor33aa33marginleft03emmwparseroutput cs1subscriptionmwparseroutput cs1registrationmwparseroutput cs1formatfontsize95mwparseroutput cs1kernleftmwparseroutput cs1kernwlleftpaddingleft02emmwparseroutput cs1kernrightmwparseroutput cs1kernwlrightpaddingright02em Visit to a working IBM 402 in Conroe Texas External links edit IBM History 402 developed in 1948 or 1949 The IBM 402 at Columbia University Some IBM 402 pictures from Paul Pierces Computer Collection Annotated labeled photograph of an IBM 402 from its manual Company that still uses IBM 402
