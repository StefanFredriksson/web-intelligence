supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis Given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other making it a non probabilistic binary linear classifier although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on the side of the gap on which they fall In addition to performing linear classification SVMs can efficiently perform a nonlinear classification using what is called the kernel trick implicitly mapping their inputs into highdimensional feature spaces When data are unlabelled supervised learning is not possible and an unsupervised learning approach is required which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups and then map new data to these formed groups The supportvector clustering 2 algorithm created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik applies the statistics of support vectors developed in the support vector machines algorithm

links Motivation edit H 1 does not separate the classes H 2 does but only with a small margin H 3 separates them with the maximal margin Classifying data is a common task in machine learning Suppose some given data points each belong to one of two classes and the goal is to decide which class a new data point will be in In the case of supportvector machines a data point is viewed as a p displaystyle p dimensional vector a list of p displaystyle p numbers and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a p 1 displaystyle p1 dimensional hyperplane This is called a linear classifier There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation or margin between the two classes So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized If such a hyperplane exists it is known as the maximummargin hyperplane and the linear classifier it defines is known as a maximum margin classifier or equivalently the perceptron of optimal stability citation needed Definition edit More formally a supportvector machine constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high or infinitedimensional space which can be used for classification regression or other tasks like outliers detection 3 Intuitively a good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest trainingdata point of any class socalled functional margin since in general the larger the margin the lower the generalization error of the classifier 4 Kernel machine Whereas the original problem may be stated in a finitedimensional space it often happens that the sets to discriminate are not linearly separable in that space For this reason it was proposed by whom that the original finitedimensional space be mapped into a much higherdimensional space presumably making the separation easier in that space To keep the computational load reasonable the mappings used by SVM schemes are designed to ensure that dot products of pairs of input data vectors may be computed easily in terms of the variables in the original space by defining them in terms of a kernel function k x y displaystyle kxy selected to suit the problem 5 The hyperplanes in the higherdimensional space are defined as the set of points whose dot product with a vector in that space is constant where such a set of vectors is an orthogonal and thus minimal set of vectors that defines a hyperplane The vectors defining the hyperplanes can be chosen to be linear combinations with parameters α i displaystyle alpha i of images of feature vectors x i displaystyle xi that occur in the data base clarification needed With this choice of a hyperplane the points x displaystyle x in the feature space that are mapped into the hyperplane are defined by the relation i α i k x i x constant displaystyle textstyle sum ialpha ikxixtextconstant Note that if k x y displaystyle kxy becomes small as y displaystyle y grows further away from x displaystyle x each term in the sum measures the degree of closeness of the test point x displaystyle x to the corresponding data base point x i displaystyle xi In this way the sum of kernels above can be used to measure the relative nearness of each test point to the data points originating in one or the other of the sets to be discriminated Note the fact that the set of points x displaystyle x mapped into any hyperplane can be quite convoluted as a result allowing much more complex discrimination between sets that are not convex at all in the original space Applications edit SVMs can be used to solve various realworld problems SVMs are helpful in text and hypertext categorization as their application can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings citation needed Some methods for shallow semantic parsing are based on support vector machines 6 Classification of images can also be performed using SVMs Experimental results show that SVMs achieve significantly higher search accuracy than traditional query refinement schemes after just three to four rounds of relevance feedback This is also true for image segmentation systems including those using a modified version SVM that uses the privileged approach as suggested by Vapnik 7 8 Handwritten characters can be recognized using SVM 9 The SVM algorithm has been widely applied in the biological and other sciences They have been used to classify proteins with up to 90 of the compounds classified correctly Permutation tests based on SVM weights have been suggested as a mechanism for interpretation of SVM models 10 11 Supportvector machine weights have also been used to interpret SVM models in the past 12 Posthoc interpretation of supportvector machine models in order to identify features used by the model to make predictions is a relatively new area of research with special significance in the biological sciences History edit The original SVM algorithm was invented by Vladimir N Vapnik and Alexey Ya Chervonenkis in 1963 In 1992 Bernhard E Boser Isabelle M Guyon and Vladimir N Vapnik suggested a way to create nonlinear classifiers by applying the kernel trick to maximummargin hyperplanes 13 The current standard according to whom incarnation soft margin was proposed by Corinna Cortes and Vapnik in 1993 and published in 1995 1 Linear SVM edit Maximummargin hyperplane and margins for an SVM trained with samples from two classes Samples on the margin are called the support vectors We are given a training dataset of n displaystyle n points of the form x 1 y 1 x n y n displaystyle vec x1y1ldots vec xnyn where the y i displaystyle yi are either 1 or 1 each indicating the class to which the point x i displaystyle vec xi belongs Each x i displaystyle vec xi is a p displaystyle p dimensional real vector We want to find the maximummargin hyperplane that divides the group of points x i displaystyle vec xi for which y i 1 displaystyle yi1 from the group of points for which y i 1 displaystyle yi1 which is defined so that the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest point x i displaystyle vec xi from either group is maximized Any hyperplane can be written as the set of points x displaystyle vec x satisfying w x b 0 displaystyle vec wcdot vec xb0 where w displaystyle vec w is the not necessarily normalized normal vector to the hyperplane This is much like Hesse normal form except that w displaystyle vec w is not necessarily a unit vector The parameter b w displaystyle tfrac bvec w determines the offset of the hyperplane from the origin along the normal vector w displaystyle vec w Hardmargin edit If the training data is linearly separable we can select two parallel hyperplanes that separate the two classes of data so that the distance between them is as large as possible The region bounded by these two hyperplanes is called the margin and the maximummargin hyperplane is the hyperplane that lies halfway between them With a normalized or standardized dataset these hyperplanes can be described by the equations w x b 1 displaystyle vec wcdot vec xb1 anything on or above this boundary is of one class with label 1 and w x b 1 displaystyle vec wcdot vec xb1 anything on or below this boundary is of the other class with label 1 Geometrically the distance between these two hyperplanes is 2 w displaystyle tfrac 2vec w 14 so to maximize the distance between the planes we want to minimize w displaystyle vec w The distance is computed using the distance from a point to a plane equation We also have to prevent data points from falling into the margin we add the following constraint for each i displaystyle i either w x i b 1 displaystyle vec wcdot vec xibgeq 1 if y i 1 displaystyle yi1 or w x i b 1 displaystyle vec wcdot vec xibleq 1 if y i 1 displaystyle yi1 These constraints state that each data point must lie on the correct side of the margin This can be rewritten as y i w x i b 1 for all 1 i n 1 displaystyle yivec wcdot vec xibgeq 1quad text for all 1leq ileq nqquad qquad 1 We can put this together to get the optimization problem Minimize w displaystyle vec w subject to y i w x i b 1 displaystyle yivec wcdot vec xibgeq 1 for i 1 n displaystyle i1ldots n The w displaystyle vec w and b displaystyle b that solve this problem determine our classifier x sgn w x b displaystyle vec xmapsto operatorname sgnvec wcdot vec xb An important consequence of this geometric description is that the maxmargin hyperplane is completely determined by those x i displaystyle vec xi that lie nearest to it These x i displaystyle vec xi are called support vectors Softmargin edit To extend SVM to cases in which the data are not linearly separable we introduce the hinge loss function max 0 1 y i w x i b displaystyle max left01yivec wcdot vec xibright Note that y i displaystyle yi is the i th target ie in this case 1 or 1 and w x i b displaystyle vec wcdot vec xib is the current output This function is zero if the constraint in 1 is satisfied in other words if x i displaystyle vec xi lies on the correct side of the margin For data on the wrong side of the margin the functions value is proportional to the distance from the margin We then wish to minimize 1 n i 1 n max 0 1 y i w x i b λ w 2 displaystyle leftfrac 1nsum i1nmax left01yivec wcdot vec xibrightrightlambda lVert vec wrVert 2 where the parameter λ displaystyle lambda determines the tradeoff between increasing the margin size and ensuring that the x i displaystyle vec xi lie on the correct side of the margin Thus for sufficiently small values of λ displaystyle lambda the second term in the loss function will become negligible hence it will behave similar to the hardmargin SVM if the input data are linearly classifiable but will still learn if a classification rule is viable or not Nonlinear classification edit Kernel machine The original maximummargin hyperplane algorithm proposed by Vapnik in 1963 constructed a linear classifier However in 1992 Bernhard E Boser Isabelle M Guyon and Vladimir N Vapnik suggested a way to create nonlinear classifiers by applying the kernel trick originally proposed by Aizerman et al 15 to maximummargin hyperplanes 13 The resulting algorithm is formally similar except that every dot product is replaced by a nonlinear kernel function This allows the algorithm to fit the maximummargin hyperplane in a transformed feature space The transformation may be nonlinear and the transformed space highdimensional although the classifier is a hyperplane in the transformed feature space it may be nonlinear in the original input space It is noteworthy that working in a higherdimensional feature space increases the generalization error of supportvector machines although given enough samples the algorithm still performs well 16 Some common

displaystyle lambda yields the hardmargin classifier for linearly classifiable input data The classical approach which involves reducing 2 to a quadratic programming problem is detailed below Then more recent approaches such as subgradient descent and coordinate descent will be discussed Primal edit Minimizing 2 can be rewritten as a constrained optimization problem with a differentiable

coefficients that satisfies the given constraints Typically Euclidean distances are used The process is then repeated until a nearoptimal vector of coefficients is obtained The resulting algorithm is extremely fast in practice although few performance guarantees have been proven 18 Empirical risk minimization edit The softmargin support vector machine described above is an example of an empirical risk minimization ERM algorithm for the hinge loss Seen this way support vector machines belong to a natural class of algorithms for statistical inference and many of its unique features are due to the behavior of the hinge loss This perspective can provide further insight into how and why SVMs work and allow us to better analyze their statistical properties Risk minimization edit In supervised learning one is given a set of training examples X 1 X n displaystyle X1ldots Xn with labels y 1 y n displaystyle y1ldots yn and wishes to predict y n 1 displaystyle yn1 given X n 1 displaystyle Xn1 To do so one forms a hypothesis f displaystyle f such that f X n 1 displaystyle fXn1 is a good approximation of y n 1 displaystyle yn1 A good approximation is usually defined with the help of a loss function ℓ y z displaystyle ell yz which characterizes how bad z displaystyle z is as a prediction of y displaystyle y We would then like to choose a hypothesis that minimizes the expected risk ε f E

minimization problem to have a welldefined solution we have to place constraints on the set H displaystyle mathcal H of hypotheses being considered If H displaystyle mathcal H is a normed space as is the case for SVM a particularly effective technique is to consider only those hypotheses f displaystyle f for which f H k displaystyle lVert frVert mathcal Hk This is equivalent to imposing a

simpler hypotheses are preferred SVM and the hinge loss edit Recall that the softmargin SVM classifier w b x sgn w x b displaystyle hat wbxmapsto operatorname sgnhat wcdot xb is chosen to minimize the following expression 1 n i 1 n max 0 1 y i w x i b λ w 2 displaystyle leftfrac 1nsum i1nmax left01yiwcdot xibrightrightlambda lVert wrVert 2 In light of the above discussion we see that the SVM technique is equivalent to empirical risk minimization with Tikhonov regularization where in this case the loss function is the hinge loss ℓ y z max 0 1 y z displaystyle ell yzmax left01yzright From this perspective SVM is closely related to other fundamental classification algorithms such as regularized leastsquares and logistic regression The difference between the three lies in the choice of loss function regularized leastsquares amounts to empirical risk minimization with the squareloss ℓ s q y z y z 2 displaystyle ell sqyzyz2 logistic regression employs the logloss ℓ log y z ln 1 e y z displaystyle ell log yzln1eyz Target functions edit The difference between the hinge loss and these other loss functions is best stated in terms of target functions the function that minimizes expected risk for a given pair of random variables X y displaystyle Xy In particular let y x displaystyle yx denote y displaystyle y conditional on the event that X x displaystyle Xx In the

classifier as sgn f s q sgn f log f displaystyle operatorname sgnfsqoperatorname sgnflog f they give us more information than we need In fact they give us enough information to completely describe the distribution of y x displaystyle yx On the other hand one can check that the target function for the hinge loss is exactly f displaystyle f Thus in a sufficiently rich hypothesis spaceor equivalently for an appropriately chosen kernelthe SVM classifier will converge to the simplest function in terms of R displaystyle mathcal R that correctly classifies the data This extends the geometric interpretation of SVMfor linear classification the empirical risk is minimized by any function whose margins lie between the support vectors and the simplest of these is the maxmargin classifier 19 Properties edit SVMs belong to a family of generalized linear classifiers and can be interpreted as an extension of the perceptron They can also be considered a special case of Tikhonov regularization A special property is that they simultaneously minimize the empirical classification error and maximize the geometric margin hence they are also known as maximum margin classifiers A comparison of the SVM to other classifiers has been made by Meyer Leisch and Hornik 20 Parameter selection edit The effectiveness of SVM depends on the selection of kernel the kernels parameters and soft margin parameter CA common choice is a Gaussian kernel which has a single parameter γ displaystyle gamma The best combination of C and γ displaystyle gamma is often selected by a grid search with exponentially growing sequences of C and γ displaystyle gamma for example C 2 5 2 3 2 13 2 15 displaystyle Cin 2523dots 213215 γ 2 15 2 13 2 1 2 3 displaystyle gamma in 215213dots 2123 Typically each combination of parameter choices is checked using cross validation and the parameters with best crossvalidation accuracy are picked Alternatively recent work in Bayesian optimization can be used to select C and γ displaystyle gamma often requiring the evaluation of far fewer parameter combinations than grid search The final model which is used for testing and for classifying new data is then trained on the whole training set using the selected parameters 21 Issues edit Potential drawbacks of the SVM include the following aspects Requires full labeling of input data Uncalibrated class membership probabilities SVM stems from Vapniks theory which avoids estimating probabilities on finite data The SVM is only directly applicable for twoclass tasks Therefore algorithms that reduce the multiclass task to several binary problems have to be applied see the multiclass SVM section Parameters of a solved model are difficult to interpret Extensions edit Supportvector clustering SVC edit SVC is a similar method that also builds on kernel functions but is appropriate for unsupervised learning It is considered a fundamental method in data science citation needed Multiclass SVM edit Multiclass SVM aims to assign labels to instances by using supportvector machines where the labels are drawn from a finite set of several elements The dominant approach for doing so is to reduce the single multiclass problem into multiple binary classification problems 22 Common methods for such reduction include 22 23 Building binary classifiers that distinguish between one of the labels and the rest oneversusall or between every pair of classes oneversusone Classification of new instances for the oneversusall case is done by a winnertakesall strategy in which the classifier with the highestoutput function assigns the class it is important that the output functions be calibrated to produce comparable scores For the oneversusone approach classification is done by a maxwins voting strategy in which every classifier assigns the instance to one of the two classes then the vote for the assigned class is increased by one vote and finally the class with the most votes determines the instance classification Directed acyclic graph SVM DAGSVM 24 Errorcorrecting output codes 25 Crammer and Singer proposed a multiclass SVM method which casts the multiclass classification problem into a single optimization problem rather than decomposing it into multiple binary classification problems 26 See also Lee Lin and Wahba 27 28 Transductive supportvector machines edit Transductive supportvector machines extend SVMs in that they could also treat partially labeled data in semisupervised learning by following the principles of transduction Here in addition to the training set D displaystyle mathcal D the learner is also given a set D x i x i R p i 1 k displaystyle mathcal Dstar vec xistar mid vec xistar in mathbb R pi1k of test examples to be classified Formally a

of possibly infinite size Regression edit Supportvector regression prediction with different thresholds ε As ε increases the prediction becomes less sensitive to errors A version of SVM for regression was proposed in 1996 by Vladimir N Vapnik Harris Drucker Christopher J C Burges Linda Kaufman and Alexander J Smola 30 This method is called supportvector regression SVR The model produced by supportvector classification as described above depends only on a subset of the training data because the cost function for building the model does not care about training points that lie beyond the margin Analogously the model produced by SVR depends only on a subset of the training data because the cost function for building the model ignores any training data close to the model prediction Another SVM version known as leastsquares supportvector machine LSSVM has been proposed by Suykens and Vandewalle 31 Training the original SVR means solving 32 minimize 1 2 w 2 displaystyle frac 12w2 subject to y i w x i b ε displaystyle yilangle wxirangle bleq varepsilon where x i displaystyle xi is a training sample with target value y i displaystyle yi The inner product plus intercept w x i b displaystyle langle wxirangle b is the prediction for that sample and ε displaystyle varepsilon is a free parameter that serves as a threshold all predictions have to be within an ε displaystyle varepsilon range of the true predictions Slack variables are usually added into the above to allow for errors and to allow approximation in the case the above problem is infeasible Bayesian SVM edit In 2011 it was shown by Polson and Scott that the SVM admits a Bayesian interpretation through the technique of data augmentation 33 In this approach the SVM is viewed as a graphical model where the parameters are connected via probability distributions This extended view allows the application of Bayesian techniques to SVMs such as flexible feature modeling automatic hyperparameter tuning and predictive uncertainty quantification Recently a scalable version of the Bayesian SVM was developed by Wenzel et al enabling the application of Bayesian SVMs to big data 34 Wenzel et al develop two different versions a variational inference VI scheme for the Bayesian kernel support vector machine SVM and a stochastic version SVI for the linear Bayesian SVM 35 Implementation edit The parameters of the maximummargin hyperplane are derived by solving the optimization There exist several specialized algorithms for quickly solving the quadratic programming QP problem that arises from SVMs mostly relying on heuristics for breaking the problem down into smaller more manageable chunks Another approach is to use an interiorpoint method that uses Newton like iterations to find a solution of the KarushKuhnTucker conditions of the primal and dual problems 36 Instead of solving a sequence of brokendown problems this approach directly solves the problem altogether To avoid solving a linear system involving the large kernel matrix a lowrank approximation to the matrix is often used in the kernel trick Another common method is Platts sequential minimal optimization SMO algorithm which breaks the problem down into 2dimensional subproblems that are solved analytically eliminating the need for a numerical optimization algorithm and matrix storage This algorithm is conceptually simple easy to implement generally faster and has better scaling properties for difficult SVM problems 37 The special case of linear supportvector machines can be solved more efficiently by the same kind of algorithms used to optimize its close cousin logistic regression this class of algorithms includes subgradient descent eg PEGASOS 38 and coordinate descent eg LIBLINEAR 39 LIBLINEAR has some attractive trainingtime properties Each convergence iteration takes time linear in the time taken to read the train data and the iterations also have a Qlinear convergence property making the algorithm extremely fast The general kernel SVMs can also be solved more efficiently using subgradient descent eg PpackSVM 40 especially when parallelization is allowed Kernel SVMs are available in many machinelearning toolkits including LIBSVM MATLAB SAS SVMlight kernlab scikitlearn Shogun Weka Shark JKernelMachines OpenCV and others See also edit In situ adaptive tabulation Kernel machines
