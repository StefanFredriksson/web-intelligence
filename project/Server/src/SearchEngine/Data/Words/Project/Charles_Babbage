Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer 2 Considered by some to be a father of the computer 2 3 4 5 Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex electronic designs though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbages Analytical Engine 2 6 His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as preeminent among the many polymaths of his century 1 Parts of Babbages incomplete mechanisms are on display in the Science Museum in London In 1991 a functioning difference engine was constructed from Babbages original plans Built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbages machine would have worked Contents 1 Early life 2

birthplace is disputed but according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography he was most likely born at 44 Crosby Row Walworth Road London England 7 A blue plaque on the junction of Larcom Street and Walworth Road commemorates the event 8 His date of birth was given in his obituary in The Times as 26 December 1792 but then a nephew wrote to say that Babbage was born one year earlier in 1791 The parish register of St Marys Newington London shows that Babbage was baptised on 6 January 1792 supporting a birth year of 1791 9 10 11 Babbage c 1850 Babbage was one of four children of Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape His father was a banking partner of William Praed in founding Praeds Co of Fleet Street London in 1801 12 In 1808 the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in East Teignmouth Around the age of eight Babbage was sent to a country school in Alphington near Exeter to recover from a lifethreatening fever For a short time he attended King Edward VI Grammar School in Totnes South Devon but his health forced him back to private tutors for a time 13 Babbage then joined the 30student Holmwood Academy in Baker Street Enfield Middlesex under the Reverend Stephen Freeman The academy had a library that prompted Babbages love of mathematics He studied with two more private tutors after leaving the academy The first was a clergyman near Cambridge through him Babbage encountered Charles Simeon and his evangelical followers but the tuition was not what he needed 14 He was brought home to study at the Totnes school this was at age 16 or 17 15 The second was an Oxford tutor under whom Babbage reached a level in Classics sufficient to be accepted by Cambridge At the University of Cambridge edit Babbage arrived at Trinity College Cambridge in October 1810 16 He was already selftaught in some parts of contemporary mathematics 17 he had read in Robert Woodhouse Joseph Louis Lagrange and Marie Agnesi As a result he was disappointed in the standard mathematical instruction available at the university 7 Babbage John Herschel George Peacock and several other friends formed the Analytical Society in 1812 they were also close to Edward Ryan 18 As a student Babbage was also a member of other societies such as The Ghost Club concerned with investigating supernatural phenomena and the Extractors Club dedicated to liberating its members from the madhouse should any be committed to one 19 20 In 1812 Babbage transferred to Peterhouse Cambridge 16 He was the top mathematician there but did not graduate with honours He instead received a degree without examination in 1814 He had defended a thesis that was considered blasphemous in the preliminary public disputation but it is not known whether this fact is related to his not sitting the examination 7 After Cambridge edit Considering his reputation Babbage quickly made progress He lectured to the Royal Institution on astronomy in 1815 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1816 21 After graduation on the other hand he applied for positions unsuccessfully and had little in the way of career In 1816 he was a candidate for a teaching job at Haileybury College he had recommendations from James Ivory and John Playfair but lost out to Henry Walter 22 In 1819 Babbage and Herschel visited Paris and the Society of Arcueil meeting leading French mathematicians and physicists 23 That year Babbage applied to be professor at the University of Edinburgh with the recommendation of Pierre Simon Laplace the post went to William Wallace 24 25 26 With Herschel Babbage worked on the electrodynamics of Aragos rotations publishing in 1825 Their explanations were only transitional being picked up and broadened by Michael Faraday The phenomena are now part of the theory of eddy currents and Babbage and Herschel missed some of the clues to unification of electromagnetic theory staying close to Ampères force law 27 Babbage purchased the actuarial tables of George Barrett who died in 1821 leaving unpublished work and surveyed the field in 1826 in Comparative View of the Various Institutions for the Assurance of Lives 28 This interest followed a project to set up an insurance company prompted by Francis Baily and mooted in 1824 but not carried out 29 Babbage did calculate actuarial tables for that scheme using Equitable Society mortality data from 1762 onwards 30 During this whole period Babbage depended awkwardly on his fathers support given his fathers attitude to his early marriage of 1814 he and Edward Ryan wedded the Whitmore sisters He made a home in Marylebone in London and founded a large family 31 On his fathers death in 1827 Babbage inherited a large estate value around 100000 equivalent to 85million or 113million today making him independently wealthy 7 After his wifes death in the same year he spent time travelling In Italy he met Leopold II Grand Duke of Tuscany foreshadowing a later visit to Piedmont 21 In April 1828 he was in Rome and relying on Herschel to manage the difference engine project when he heard that he had become professor at Cambridge a position he had three times failed to obtain in 1820 1823 and 1826 32 Royal Astronomical Society edit Babbage was instrumental in founding the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820 initially known as the Astronomical Society of London 33 Its original aims were to reduce astronomical calculations to a more standard form and to circulate data 34 These directions were closely connected with Babbages ideas on computation and in 1824 he won its Gold Medal cited for his invention of an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables Babbages motivation to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation had been a commonplace since Dionysius Lardner wrote about it in 1834 in the Edinburgh Review under Babbages guidance 35 36 The context of these developments is still debated Babbages own account of the origin of the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Societys wish to improve The Nautical Almanac Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project to recalculate some part of those tables With the results to hand discrepancies were found This was in 1821 or 1822 and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation 37 The issue of the Nautical Almanac is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to Sir Joseph Banks who had died in 1820 38 A portion of the difference engine Babbage studied the requirements to establish a modern postal system with his friend Thomas Frederick Colby concluding there should be a uniform rate that was put into effect with the introduction of the Uniform Fourpenny Post supplanted by the Uniform Penny Post 39 in 1839 and 1840 Colby was another of the founding group of the Society 40 He was also in charge of the Survey of Ireland Herschel and Babbage were present at a celebrated operation of that survey the remeasuring of the Lough Foyle baseline 41 British Lagrangian School edit The Analytical Society had initially been no more than an undergraduate provocation During this period it had some more substantial achievements In 1816 Babbage Herschel and Peacock published a translation from French of the lectures of Sylvestre Lacroix which was then the stateoftheart calculus textbook 42 Reference to Lagrange in calculus terms marks out the application of what are now called formal power series British mathematicians had used them from about 1730 to 1760 As reintroduced they were not simply applied as notations in differential calculus They opened up the fields of functional equations including the difference equations fundamental to the difference engine and operator Dmodule methods for differential equations The analogy of difference and differential equations was notationally changing Δ to D as a finite difference becomes infinitesimal These symbolic directions became popular as operational calculus and pushed to the point of diminishing returns The Cauchy concept of limit was kept at bay 43 Woodhouse had already founded this second British Lagrangian School with its treatment of Taylor series as formal 44 In this context function composition is complicated to express because the chain rule is not simply applied to second and higher derivatives This matter was known to Woodhouse by 1803 who took from Louis François Antoine Arbogast what is now called Faà di Brunos formula In essence it was known to Abraham De Moivre 1697 Herschel found the method impressive Babbage knew of it and it was later noted by Ada Lovelace as compatible with the analytical engine 45 In the period to 1820 Babbage worked intensively on functional equations in general and resisted both conventional finite differences and Arbogasts approach in which Δ and D were related by the simple additive case of the exponential map But via Herschel he was influenced by Arbogasts ideas in the matter of iteration ie composing a function with itself possibly many times 44 Writing in a major paper on functional equations in the Philosophical Transactions 18156 Babbage said his starting point was work of Gaspard Monge 46 Academic edit From 1828 to 1839 Babbage was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge Not a conventional resident don and inattentive to his teaching responsibilities he wrote three topical books during this period of his life He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832 47 Babbage was out of sympathy with colleagues George Biddell Airy his predecessor as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College Cambridge 48 thought an issue should be made of his lack of interest in lecturing Babbage planned to lecture in 1831 on political economy Babbages reforming direction looked to see university education more inclusive universities doing more for research a broader syllabus and more interest in applications but William Whewell found the programme unacceptable A controversy Babbage had with Richard Jones lasted for six years 49 He never did give a lecture 50 It was during this period that Babbage tried to enter politics Simon Schaffer writes that his views of the 1830s included disestablishment of the Church of England a broader political franchise and inclusion of manufacturers as stakeholders 51 He twice stood for Parliament as a candidate for the borough of Finsbury In 1832 he came in third among five candidates missing out by some 500 votes in the twomember constituency when two other reformist candidates Thomas Wakley and Christopher Temple split the vote 52 53 In his memoirs Babbage related how this election brought him the friendship of Samuel Rogers his brother Henry Rogers wished to support Babbage again but died within days 54 In 1834 Babbage finished last among four 55 56 57 In 1832 Babbage Herschel and Ivory were appointed Knights of the Royal Guelphic Order however they were not subsequently made knights bachelor to entitle them to the prefix Sir which often came with appointments to that foreign order though Herschel was later created a baronet 58 Declinarians learned societies and the BAAS edit Letter to Sir Humphry Davy 1822 Babbage now emerged as a polemicist One of his biographers notes that all his books contain a campaigning element His Reflections on the Decline of Science and some of its Causes 1830 stands out however for its sharp attacks It aimed to improve British science and more particularly to oust Davies Gilbert as President of the Royal Society which Babbage wished to reform 59 It was written out of pique when Babbage hoped to become the junior secretary of the Royal Society as Herschel was the senior but failed because of his antagonism to Humphry Davy 60 Michael Faraday had a reply written by Gerrit Moll as On the Alleged Decline of Science in England 1831 61 On the front of the Royal Society Babbage had no impact with the bland election of the Duke of Sussex to succeed Gilbert the same year As a broad manifesto on the other hand his Decline led promptly to the formation in 1831 of the British Association for the Advancement of Science BAAS 61 The Mechanics Magazine in 1831 identified as Declinarians the followers of Babbage In an unsympathetic tone it pointed out David Brewster writing in the Quarterly Review as another leader with the barb that both Babbage and Brewster had received public money 62 In the debate of the period on statistics qua data collection and what is now statistical inference the BAAS in its Statistical Section which owed something also to Whewell opted for data collection This Section was the sixth established in 1833 with Babbage as chairman and John Elliot Drinkwater as secretary The foundation of the Statistical Society followed 63 64 65 Babbage was its public face backed by Richard Jones and Robert Malthus 66 On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures edit On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures 1835 Babbages notation for machine parts explanation from On a method of expressing by signs the action of machinery 1827 of his Mechanical Notation invented for his own use in understanding the work on the difference engine and an influence on the conception of the analytical engine 67 Babbage published On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures 1832 on the organisation of industrial production It was an influential early work of operational research 68 John Rennie the Younger in addressing the Institution of Civil Engineers on manufacturing in 1846 mentioned mostly surveys in encyclopaedias and Babbages book was first an article in the Encyclopædia Metropolitana the form in which Rennie noted it in the company of related works by John Farey Jr Peter Barlow and Andrew Ure 69 From An essay on the general principles which regulate the application of machinery to manufactures and the mechanical arts 1827 which became the Encyclopædia Metropolitana article of 1829 Babbage developed the schematic classification of machines that combined with discussion of factories made up the first part of the book The second part considered the domestic and political economy of manufactures 70 The book sold well and quickly went to a fourth edition 1836 71 Babbage represented his work as largely a result of actual observations in factories British and abroad It was not in its first edition intended to address deeper questions of political economy the second late 1832 did with three further chapters including one on piece rate 72 The book also contained ideas on rational design in factories and profit sharing 73 Babbage principle edit In Economy of Machinery was described what is now called the Babbage principle It pointed out commercial advantages available with more careful division of labour As Babbage himself noted it had already appeared in the work of Melchiorre Gioia in 1815 74 The term was introduced in 1974 by Harry Braverman 75 Related formulations are the principle of multiples of Philip Sargant Florence and the balance of processes 76 77 What Babbage remarked is that skilled workers typically spend parts of their time performing tasks that are below their skill level If the labour process can be divided among several workers labour costs may be cut by assigning only highskill tasks to highcost workers restricting other tasks to lowerpaid workers 78 He also pointed out that training or apprenticeship can be taken as fixed costs but that returns to scale are available by his approach of standardisation of tasks therefore again favouring the factory system 79 His view of human capital was restricted to minimising the time period for recovery of training costs 80 Publishing edit Another aspect of the work was its detailed breakdown of the cost structure of book publishing Babbage took the unpopular line from the publishers perspective of exposing the trades profitability 81 He went as far as to name the organisers of the trades restrictive practices 82 Twenty years later he attended a meeting hosted by John Chapman to campaign against the Booksellers Association still a cartel 83 Influence edit It has been written that what Arthur Young was to agriculture Charles Babbage was to the factory visit and machinery 84 Babbages theories are said to have influenced the layout of the 1851 Great Exhibition 85 and his views had a strong effect on his contemporary George Julius Poulett Scrope 86 Karl Marx argued that the source of the productivity of the factory system was exactly the combination of the division of labour with machinery building on Adam Smith Babbage and Ure 87 Where Marx picked up on Babbage and disagreed with Smith was on the motivation for division of labour by the manufacturer as Babbage did he wrote that it was for the sake of profitability rather than productivity and identified an impact on the concept of a trade 88 John Ruskin went further to oppose completely what manufacturing in Babbages sense stood for 89 Babbage also affected the economic thinking of John Stuart Mill 90 George Holyoake saw Babbages detailed discussion of profit sharing as substantive in the tradition of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier if requiring the attentions of a benevolent captain of industry and ignored at the time 91 Works by Babbage and Ure were published in French translation in 1830 92 On the Economy of Machinery was translated in 1833 into French by Édouard Biot and into German the same year by Gottfried Friedenberg 93 The French engineer and writer on industrial organisation Léon Lalanne was influenced by Babbage but also by the economist Claude Lucien Bergery in reducing the issues to technology 94 William Jevons connected Babbages economy of labour with his own labour experiments of 1870 95 The Babbage principle is an inherent assumption in Frederick Winslow Taylor s scientific management 96 Mary Boole the wife of Babbages collaborator George Boole claimed that there was profound influencevia her uncle George Everest of Indian thought in general and Indian logic in particular on him and on George Boole as well as on Augustus De Morgan Think what must have been the effect of the intense Hinduizing of three such men as Babbage De Morgan and George Boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 183065 What share had it in generating the Vector Analysis and the mathematics by which investigations in physical science are now conducted 97 Natural theology edit In 1837 responding to the series of eight Bridgewater Treatises Babbage published his Ninth Bridgewater Treatise under the title On the Power Wisdom and Goodness of God as manifested in the Creation In this work Babbage weighed in on the side of uniformitarianism in a current debate 98 He preferred the conception of creation in which a Godgiven natural law dominated removing the need for continuous contrivance 99 The book is a work of natural theology and incorporates extracts from related correspondence of Herschel with Charles Lyell 100 Babbage put forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator In this book Babbage dealt with relating interpretations between science and religion on the one hand he insisted that there exists no fatal collision between the words of Scripture and the facts of nature on the one hand he wrote the Book of Genesis was not meant to be read literally in relation to scientific terms Against those who said these were in conflict he wrote that the contradiction they have imagined can have no real existence and that whilst the testimony of Moses remains unimpeached we may also be permitted to confide in the testimony of our senses 101 The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise was quoted extensively in Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation 102 The parallel with Babbages computing machines is made explicit as allowing plausibility to the theory that transmutation of species could be preprogrammed 103 Plate from the Ninth Bridgewater Treatise showing a parametric family of algebraic curves acquiring isolated real points Jonar Ganeri author of Indian Logic believes Babbage may have been influenced by Indian thought one possible route would be through Henry Thomas Colebrooke 104 Mary Everest Boole argues that Babbage was introduced to Indian thought in the 1820s by her uncle George Everest Some time about 1825 Everest came to England for two or three years and made a fast and lifelong friendship with Herschel and with Babbage who was then quite young I would ask any fairminded mathematician to read Babbages Ninth Bridgewater Treatise and compare it with the works of his contemporaries in England and then ask himself whence came the peculiar conception of the nature of miracle which underlies Babbages ideas of Singular Points on Curves Chap viii from European Theology or Hindu Metaphysic Oh how the English clergy of that day hated Babbages book 97 Religious views edit Babbage was raised in the Protestant form of the Christian faith his family having inculcated in him an orthodox form of worship 105 He explained mwparseroutput templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40pxmwparseroutput templatequote templatequotecitelineheight15emtextalignleftpaddingleft16emmargintop0 My excellent mother taught me the usual forms of my daily and nightly prayer and neither in my father nor my mother was there any mixture of bigotry and intolerance on the one hand nor on the other of that unbecoming and familiar mode of addressing the Almighty which afterwards so much disgusted me in my youthful years Babbage 1864 Rejecting the Athanasian Creed as a direct contradiction in terms in his youth he looked to Samuel Clarke s works on religion of which Being and Attributes of God 1704 exerted a particularly strong influence on him Later in life Babbage concluded that the true value of the Christian religion rested not on speculative theology but upon those doctrines of kindness and benevolence which that religion claims and enforces not merely in favour of man himself but of every creature susceptible of pain or of happiness 106 In his autobiography Passages from the Life of a Philosopher 1864 Babbage wrote a whole chapter on the topic of religion where he identified three sources of divine knowledge 107 A priori or mystical experience From Revelation From the examination of the works of the Creator He stated on the basis of the design argument that studying the works of nature had been the more appealing evidence and the one which led him to actively profess the existence of God 108 109 Advocating for natural theology he wrote In the works of the Creator ever open to our examination we possess a firm basis on which to raise the superstructure of an enlightened creed The more man inquires into the laws which regulate the material universe the more he is convinced that all its varied forms arise from the action of a few simple principles The works of the Creator ever present to our senses give a living and perpetual testimony of his power and goodness far surpassing any evidence transmitted through human testimony The testimony of man becomes fainter at every stage of transmission whilst each new inquiry into the works of the Almighty gives to us more exalted views of his wisdom his goodness and his power Babbage 1864 110 Like Samuel Vince Babbage also wrote a defence of the belief in divine miracles 111 Against objections previously posed by David Hume Babbage advocated for the belief of divine agency stating we must not measure the credibility or incredibility of an event by the narrow sphere of our own experience nor forget that there is a Divine energy which overrides what we familiarly call the laws of nature 112 He alluded to the limits of human experience expressing all that we see in a miracle is an effect which is new to our observation and whose cause is concealed The cause may be beyond the sphere of our observation and would be thus beyond the familiar sphere of nature but this does not make the event a violation of any law of nature The limits of mans observation lie within very narrow boundaries and it would be arrogance to suppose that the reach of mans power is to form the limits of the natural world Later life edit The Illustrated London News 4 November 1871 113 The British Association was consciously modelled on the Deutsche NaturforscherVersammlung founded in 1822 114 It rejected romantic science as well as metaphysics and started to entrench the divisions of science from literature and professionals from amateurs 115 Belonging as he did to the Wattite faction in the BAAS represented in particular by James Watt the younger Babbage identified closely with industrialists He wanted to go faster in the same directions and had little time for the more gentlemanly component of its membership Indeed he subscribed to a version of conjectural history that placed industrial society as the culmination of human development and shared this view with Herschel A clash with Roderick Murchison led in 1838 to his withdrawal from further involvement 116 117 At the end of the same year he sent in his resignation as Lucasian professor walking away also from the Cambridge struggle with Whewell His interests became more focussed on computation and metrology and on international contacts 118 Metrology programme edit A project announced by Babbage was to tabulate all physical constants referred to as constants of nature a phrase in itself a neologism and then to compile an encyclopaedic work of numerical information He was a pioneer in the field of absolute measurement 119 His ideas followed on from those of Johann Christian Poggendorff and were mentioned to Brewster in 1832 There were to be 19 categories of constants and Ian Hacking sees these as reflecting in part Babbages eccentric enthusiasms 120 Babbages paper On Tables of the Constants of Nature and Art was reprinted by the Smithsonian Institution in 1856 with an added note that the physical tables of Arnold Henry Guyot will form a part of the important work proposed in this article 121 Exact measurement was also key to the development of machine tools Here again Babbage is considered a pioneer with Henry Maudslay William Sellers and Joseph Whitworth 122 Engineer and inventor edit Through the Royal Society Babbage acquired the friendship of the engineer Marc Brunel It was through Brunel that Babbage knew of Joseph Clement and so came to encounter the artisans whom he observed in his work on manufactures 123 Babbage provided an introduction for Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1830 for a contact with the proposed Bristol Birmingham Railway 124 He carried out studies around 1838 to show the superiority of the broad gauge for railways used by Brunels Great Western Railway 125 126 In 1838 Babbage invented the pilot also called a cowcatcher the metal frame attached to the front of locomotives that clears the tracks of obstacles 127 he also constructed a dynamometer car 125 His eldest son Benjamin Herschel Babbage worked as an engineer for Brunel on the railways before emigrating to Australia in the 1850s 128 Babbage also invented an ophthalmoscope which he gave to Thomas Wharton Jones for testing Jones however ignored it The device only came into use after being independently invented by Hermann von Helmholtz 129 130 Cryptography edit Babbage achieved notable results in cryptography though this was still not known a century after his death Letter frequency was category 18 of Babbages tabulation project Joseph Henry later defended interest in it in the absence of the facts as relevant to the management of movable type 120 As early as 1845 Babbage had solved a cipher that had been posed as a challenge by his nephew Henry Hollier and in the process he made a discovery about ciphers that were based on Vigenère tables Specifically he realised that enciphering plain text with a keyword rendered the cipher text subject to modular arithmetic 131 During the Crimean War of the 1850s Babbage broke Vigenères autokey cipher as well as the much weaker cipher that is called Vigenère cipher today 132 His discovery was kept a military secret and was not published Credit for the result was instead given to Friedrich Kasiski a Prussian infantry officer who made the same discovery some years later 133 However in 1854 Babbage published the solution of a Vigenère cipher which had been published previously in the Journal of the Society of Arts 131 134 In 1855 Babbage also published a short letter Cypher Writing in the same journal 135 Nevertheless his priority was not established until 1985 131 136 Public nuisances edit Babbage involved himself in wellpublicised but unpopular campaigns against public nuisances He once counted all the broken panes of glass of a factory publishing in 1857 a Table of the Relative Frequency of the Causes of Breakage of Plate Glass Windows Of 464 broken panes 14 were caused by drunken men women or boys 137 138 139 Babbages distaste for commoners the Mob included writing Observations of Street Nuisances in 1864 as well as tallying up 165 nuisances over a period of 80 days He especially hated street music and in particular the music of organ grinders against whom he railed in various venues The following quotation is typical It is difficult to estimate the misery inflicted upon thousands of persons and the absolute pecuniary penalty imposed upon multitudes of intellectual workers by the loss of their time destroyed by organgrinders and other similar nuisances 140 Babbage was not alone in his campaign A convert to the cause was the MP Michael Thomas Bass 141 In the 1860s Babbage also took up the anti hooprolling campaign He blamed hooprolling boys for driving their iron hoops under horses legs with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg 142 Babbage achieved a certain notoriety in this matter being denounced in debate in Commons in 1864 for commencing a crusade against the popular game of tipcat and the trundling of hoops 143 Computing pioneer edit Part of Charles Babbages Difference Engine 1 assembled after his death by his son Henry Prevost Babbage 18241918 using parts found in Charles laboratory Whipple Museum of the History of Science Cambridge England Babbages machines were among the first mechanical computers That they were not actually completed was largely because of funding problems and clashes of personality most notably with Airy the Astronomer Royal 144 Babbage directed the building of some steampowered machines that achieved some modest success suggesting that calculations could be mechanised For more than ten years he received government funding for his project which amounted to 17000 but eventually the Treasury lost confidence in him 145 While Babbages machines were mechanical and unwieldy their basic architecture was similar to a modern computer The data and program memory were separated operation was instructionbased the control unit could make conditional jumps and the machine had a separate IO unit 145 Background on mathematical tables edit In Babbages time printed mathematical tables were calculated by human computers in other words by hand They were central to navigation science and engineering as well as mathematics Mistakes were known to occur in transcription as well as calculation 50 At Cambridge Babbage saw the fallibility of this process and the opportunity of adding mechanisation into its management His own account of his path towards mechanical computation references a particular occasion In 1812 he was sitting in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms which he knew to be full of mistakes when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery The French government had produced several tables by a new method Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages and the work itself which was restricted to addition and subtraction was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes Here for the first time mass production was applied to arithmetic and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers people could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable 146 There was another period seven years later when his interest was aroused by the issues around computation of mathematical tables The French official initiative by Gaspard de Prony and its problems of implementation were familiar to him After the Napoleonic Wars came to a close scientific contacts were renewed on the level of personal contact in 1819 Charles Blagden was in Paris looking into the printing of the stalled de Prony project and lobbying for the support of the Royal Society In works of the 1820s and 1830s Babbage referred in detail to de Pronys project 147 148 Difference engine edit The Science Museum s Difference Engine No 2 built from Babbages design Main article Difference engine Babbage began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine made to compute values of polynomial functions It was created to calculate a series of values automatically By using the method of finite differences it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division 149 For a prototype difference engine Babbage brought in Joseph Clement to implement the design in 1823 Clement worked to high standards but his machine tools were particularly elaborate Under the standard terms of business of the time he could charge for their construction and would also own them He and Babbage fell out over costs around 1831 150 Some parts of the prototype survive in the Museum of the History of Science Oxford 151 This prototype evolved into the first difference engine It remained unfinished and the finished portion is located at the Science Museum in London This first difference engine would have been composed of around 25000 parts weighed fifteen tons 13600kg and would have been 8ft 24m tall Although Babbage received ample funding for the project it was never completed He later 18471849 produced detailed drawings for an improved versionDifference Engine No 2 but did not receive funding from the British government His design was finally constructed in 19891991 using his plans and 19thcentury manufacturing tolerances It performed its first calculation at the Science Museum London returning results to 31 digits Nine years later in 2000 the Science Museum completed the printer Babbage had designed for the difference engine 152 Completed models edit The Science Museum has constructed two Difference Engines according to Babbages plans for the Difference Engine No 2 One is owned by the museum The other owned by the technology multimillionaire Nathan Myhrvold went on exhibition at the Computer History Museum 153 in Mountain View California on 10 May 2008 154 The two models that have been constructed are not replicas Myhrvolds engine is the first design by Babbage and the Science Museums is a later model citation needed Analytical Engine edit Main article Analytical Engine After the attempt at making the first difference engine fell through Babbage worked to design a more complex machine called the Analytical Engine He hired C G Jarvis who had previously worked for Clement as a draughtsman 155 The Analytical Engine marks the transition from mechanised arithmetic to fullyfledged general purpose computation It is largely on it that Babbages standing as computer pioneer rests 156 The major innovation was that the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using punched cards the Engine was intended to use loops of Jacquards punched cards to control a mechanical calculator which could use as input the results of preceding computations 157 158 The machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers including sequential control branching and looping It would have been the first mechanical device to be in principle Turingcomplete The Engine was not a single physical machine but rather a succession of designs that Babbage tinkered with until his death in 1871 citation needed Part of the Analytical Engine on display in 1843 left of centre in this engraving of the King George III Museum in Kings College London Ada Lovelace and Italian followers edit Ada Lovelace who corresponded with Babbage during his development of the Analytical Engine is credited with developing an algorithm that would enable the Engine to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers 159 Despite documentary evidence in Lovelaces own handwriting 159 some scholars dispute to what extent the ideas were Lovelaces own 160 161 162 For this achievement she is often described as the first computer programmer 163 failed verification though no programming language had yet been invented 159 164 Lovelace also translated and wrote literature supporting the project Describing the engines programming by punch cards she wrote We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves 158 Babbage visited Turin in 1840 at the invitation of Giovanni Plana In 1842 Charles Wheatstone approached Lovelace to translate a paper of Luigi Menabrea who had taken notes of Babbages Turin talks and Babbage asked her to add something of her own Fortunato Prandi who acted as interpreter in Turin was an Italian exile and follower of Giuseppe Mazzini 165 Swedish followers edit Per Georg Scheutz wrote about the difference engine in 1830 and experimented in automated computation After 1834 and Lardners Edinburgh Review article he set up a project of his own doubting whether Babbages initial plan could be carried out This he pushed through with his son Edvard Scheutz 166 Another Swedish engine was that of Martin Wiberg 1860 167 Legacy edit In 2011 researchers in Britain proposed a multimillionpound project Plan 28 to construct Babbages Analytical Engine Since Babbages plans were continually being refined and were never completed they intended to engage the public in the project and crowdsource the analysis of what should be built 168 It would have the equivalent of 675 bytes of memory and run at a clock speed of about 7Hz They hope to complete it by the 150th anniversary of Babbages death in 2021 169 Advances in MEMS and nanotechnology have led to recent hightech experiments in mechanical computation The benefits suggested include operation in high radiation or high temperature environments 170 These modern versions of mechanical computation were highlighted in The Economist in its special end of the millennium black cover issue in an article entitled Babbages Last Laugh 171 Due to his association with the town Babbage was chosen in 2007 to appear on the 5 Totnes pound note 172 An image of Babbage features in the British cultural icons section of the newly designed British passport in 2015 173 Family edit Babbages grave at Kensal Green Cemetery London photographed in 2014 On 25 July 1814 Babbage married Georgiana Whitmore at St Michaels Church in Teignmouth Devon her sister Louisa married Edward Ryan 18 The couple lived at Dudmaston Hall 174 Shropshire where Babbage engineered the central heating system before moving to 5 Devonshire Street London in 1815 175 Charles and Georgiana had eight children 176 but only four Benjamin Herschel Georgiana Whitmore Dugald Bromhead and Henry Prevost survived childhood Charles wife Georgiana died in Worcester on 1 September 1827 the same year as his father their second son also named Charles and their newborn son Alexander Benjamin Herschel

Prevost Babbage 18241918 Alexander Forbes Babbage 18271827 His youngest surviving son Henry Prevost Babbage 18241918 went on to create six small demonstration pieces for Difference Engine No 1 based on his fathers designs 177 one of which was sent to Harvard University where it was later discovered by Howard H Aiken pioneer of the Harvard Mark I Henry Prevosts 1910 Analytical Engine Mill previously on display at Dudmaston Hall is now on display at the Science Museum 178 Death edit Charles Babbages brain is on display at The Science Museum Babbage lived and worked for over 40 years at 1 Dorset Street Marylebone where he died at the age of 79 on 18 October 1871 he was buried in Londons Kensal Green Cemetery According to Horsley Babbage died of renal inadequacy secondary to cystitis 179 He had declined both a knighthood and baronetcy He also argued against hereditary peerages favouring life peerages instead 180 Autopsy report edit In 1983 the autopsy report for Charles Babbage was discovered and later published by his greatgreatgrandson 181 182 A copy of the original is also available 183 Half of Babbages brain is preserved at the Hunterian Museum in the Royal College of Surgeons in London 184 The other half of Babbages brain is on display in the Science Museum London 185 Memorials edit Green plaque in London There is a black plaque commemorating the 40 years Babbage spent at 1 Dorset Street London 186 Locations institutions and other things named after Babbage include The Moon crater Babbage The Charles Babbage Institute an information technology archive and research center at the University of Minnesota British Rail named a locomotive after him in the 1990s The Babbage Building at the University of Plymouth where the universitys school of computing is based The Babbage programming language for GEC 4000 series minicomputers Babbage The Economist s Science and Technology blog 187 The former chain retail computer and videogames store Babbages now GameStop was named after him 188 In fiction and film edit Babbage frequently appears in steampunk works he has been called an iconic figure of the genre 189 Other works in which Babbage appears include As a Great Thinker in the 2008 strategy video game Civilization Revolution 190 The 2008 short film Babbage Sydney Padua created The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage a cartoon alternate history in which Babbage and Lovelace succeed in building the analytic engine It quotes heavily from the writings of Lovelace Babbage and their contemporaries 191 192 Kate Beaton cartoonist

God This I studied and felt that its doctrine was much more intelligible and satisfactory than that of the former work I may now state as the result of a long life spent in studying the works of the Creator that I am satisfied they afford far more satisfactory and more convincing proofs of the existence of a supreme Being than any evidence transmitted through human testimony can possibly supply
