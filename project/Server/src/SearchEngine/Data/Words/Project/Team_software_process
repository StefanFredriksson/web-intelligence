ITIL Glossaries Artificial intelligence Computer science Electrical and electronics engineering v t e In combination with the personal software process PSP the team software process TSP provides a defined operational process framework that is designed to help teams of managers and engineers organize projects and produce software the principles products that range in size from small projects of several thousand lines of code KLOC to very large projects greater than half a million lines of code The TSP is intended to improve the levels of quality and productivity of a teams software development project in order to help them better meet the cost and schedule commitments of developing a software system 1 2 3 4 The initial version of the TSP was developed and piloted by Watts Humphrey in the late 1990s 5 and the Technical Report 6 for TSP sponsored by the US Department of Defense was published in November 2000 The book by Watts Humphrey 7 Introduction to the Team Software Process presents a view of the TSP intended for use in academic settings that focuses on the process of building a software production team establishing team goals distributing team roles and other teamworkrelated activities Contents 1 Introduction to TSP 2 How TSP works 3 Latest developments 4 Publications 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Introduction to TSP edit The primary goal of TSP is to create a team environment for establishing and maintaining a selfdirectedteam and supporting disciplined individual work as a base of PSP framework Selfdirected team means that the team manages itself plans and tracks their work manages the quality of their work and works proactively to meet team goals TSP has two principal components teambuilding and teamworking Teambuilding is a process that defines roles for each team member and sets up teamwork through TSP launch and periodical relaunchTeamworking is a process that deals with engineering processes and practices utilized by the teamTSP in short provides engineers and managers with a way that establishes and manages their team to produce the highquality software on schedule and budget How TSP works edit Before engineers can participate in the TSP it is required that they have already learned about the PSP so that the TSP can work effectively Training is also required for other team members the team lead and management The TSP software development cycle begins with a planning process called the launch led by a coach who has been specially trained and is either certified or provisional 8 9 The launch is designed to begin the team building process and during this time teams and managers establish goals define team roles assess risks estimate effort allocate tasks and produce a team plan During an execution phase developers track planned and actual effort schedule and defects meeting regularly usually weekly to report status and revise plans A development cycle ends with a Post Mortem to assess performance revise planning parameters and capture lessons learned for process improvement The coach role focuses on supporting the team and the individuals on the team as the process expert while being independent of direct project management responsibility 10 11 The team leader role is different from the coach role in that team leaders are responsible to management for products and project outcomes while the coach is responsible for developing individual and team performance 12 13 Latest developments edit TSP has been adapted to work with other types of knowledge work including systems engineering 14 and services 15 Mapping TSP to CMMI practices was documented in 2010 16 and piloted as an alternative path to implement CMMI process improvement 17 18 A body of knowledge BOK was issued in 2010 19 The coach mentor program guidebook was released in 2010 20 According to a study by Capers Jones TSP is one of the most successful development methodologies regarding schedule quality and budget TCO 21 Publications edit TSP Leading a Development Team 2005 TSP Coaching Development Teams 2005 See also edit Personal software process PSP Watts Humphrey References edit Jones Capers 2009
