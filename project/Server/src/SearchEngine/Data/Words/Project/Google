History Main articles History of Google and List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet See also Alphabet Inc Early years Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2003 Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in Stanford California 18 The project initially involved an unofficial third founder Scott Hassan the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine but he left before Google was officially founded as a company 19 20 Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006 21 22 While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites 23 They called this algorithm PageRank it determined a websites relevance by the number of pages and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site 24 25 Page told his ideas to Hassan who began writing the code to implement Pages ideas 19 Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine BackRub because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site 26 27 28 Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later coauthored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine published in 1998 Héctor GarcíaMolina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project 29 PageRank was influenced by a similar pageranking and sitescoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex developed by Robin Li in 1996 with Larry Pages PageRank patent including a citation to Lis earlier RankDex patent Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu 30 31 32 Eventually they changed the name to Google the name of the search engine originated from a misspelling of the word googol 33 34 the number 1 followed by 100 zeros which was picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information 35 Googles original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in HTML the markup language used for designing web pages 36 The domain
